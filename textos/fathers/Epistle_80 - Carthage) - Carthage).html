<h1>Epistle 80</h1>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Cyprian to Sergius, Rogatianus, and the Other Confessors in Prison.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; He Consoles Rogatianus and His Colleagues, the Confessors in Prison, and Gives Them Courage by the Example of the Martyrs Rogatianus the Elder and Felicissimus. The Letter Itself Indicates that It Was Written in Exile.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to Sergius and Rogatianus, and the rest of the confessors in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, everlasting health. I salute you, dearest and most blessed brethren, myself also desiring to enjoy the sight of you, if the state in which I am placed would permit me to come to you. For what could happen to me more desirable and more joyful than to be now close to you, that you might embrace me with those hands, which, pure and innocent, and maintaining the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord, have rejected the profane <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>? What more pleasant and sublime than now to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> your lips, which with a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> voice have confessed the Lord, to be looked upon even in presence by your eyes, which, despising the world, have become worthy  of looking upon God? But since opportunity is not afforded me to share in this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, I send this letter in my stead to your ears and to your eyes, by which I congratulate and exhort you that you persevere strongly and steadily in the confession of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and having entered on the way of the Lord's condescension, that you go on in the strength of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, to receive the crown, having the Lord as your protector and guide, who said, <q>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052989"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> O blessed <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, which your presence has enlightened! O blessed <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, which sends the men of God to heaven! O darkness, more bright than the sun itself, and clearer than the light of this world, where now are placed temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and your members are to be sanctified by divine confessions!</p>

<p>2. Nor let anything now be revolved in your hearts and minds besides the divine precepts and heavenly commands, with which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has ever animated you to the endurance of suffering. Let no one think of death, but of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; nor of temporary punishment, but of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; since it is written, <q>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; </q>  and again, <q>A broken spirit is a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God: a contrite and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> heart God does not despise.</q>  And again, where the sacred Scripture speaks of the tortures which consecrate God's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and sanctify them in the very trial of suffering: <q>And if they have suffered torments in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, yet is their hope full of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded: for God <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> them, and found them worthy of Himself. As gold in the furnace has He tried them, and received them as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of a burnt-offering, and in due time regard shall be had unto them. The righteous shall shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the stubble. They shall judge the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and have dominion over the people; and their Lord shall reign for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052992"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse4">Wisdom&nbsp;3:4-8</a></span> When, therefore, you reflect that you shall judge and reign with Christ the Lord, you must needs exult and tread under foot present sufferings, in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of what is to come; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that from the beginning of the world it has been so appointed that righteousness should suffer there in the conflict of the world, since in the beginning, even at the first, the righteous Abel was slain, and thereafter all righteous men, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who were sent. To all of whom the Lord also in Himself has appointed an example, teaching that none shall attain to His kingdom but those who have followed Him in His own way, saying, <q>He that loves his life in this world shall lose it; and he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his life in this world shall keep it unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052993"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;12:28</a></span> And again: <q>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but rather <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him who is able to destroy both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052994"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;10:28</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also exhorts us that we who desire to attain to the Lord's promises ought to imitate the Lord in all things. <q>We are,</q> says he, <q>the sons of God: but if sons, then heirs; heirs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with Him, that we may also be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> together.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052995"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;8:16-17</a></span> Moreover, he added the comparison of the present time and of the future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, saying, <q>The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052996"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans 8:18</a></span> Of which brightness, when we consider the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, it behooves us to bear all afflictions and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>; because, although many are the afflictions of the righteous, yet those are delivered from them all who trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>3. Blessed <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also, who are established with you in the same <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of confession, who, maintaining the Lord's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and braver than their sex, not only themselves are near to the crown of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but have afforded an example to other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> by their constancy! And lest anything should be wanting to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of your number, that each sex and every age also might be with you in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, the divine condescension has also associated with you boys  in a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> confession; representing to us something of the same kind as once did Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, the illustrious youths to whom, when shut up in the furnace, the fires gave way, and the flames gave refreshment, the Lord being present with them, and proving that against His confessors and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> the heat of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> could have no power, but that they who trusted in God should always continue unhurt and safe in all dangers. And I beg you to consider more carefully, in accordance with your religion, what must have been the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in these youths which could deserve such full acknowledgment from the Lord. For, prepared for every <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, as we ought all to be, they say to the king, <q>O king <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, we are not careful to answer you in this matter; for our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and He will deliver us out of your hand, O king! But if not, be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note052998"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse16">Daniel 3:16-18</a></span> Although they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and, in accordance with their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they might even be delivered from their present punishment, they still would not boast of this, nor claim it for themselves, saying, <q>But if not.</q> Lest the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of their confession should be less without the testimony of their suffering, they added that God could do all things; but yet they would not trust in this, so as to wish to be delivered at the moment; but they thought on that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> liberty and security.</p>

<p>4. And you also, retaining this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and meditating day and night, with your whole heart prepared for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, think of the future only, with contempt for the present, that you may be able to come to the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom, and to the embrace and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, and the sight of the Lord, that you may follow in all things Rogatianus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> old man who, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of our time, makes a way for you by his religious <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and divine condescension, who, with Felicissimus our brother, ever quiet and temperate, receiving the attack of a ferocious people, first prepared for you a dwelling in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and, marking out the way  for you in some measure, now also goes before you. That this may be consummated in you, we beseech the Lord in constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that from beginnings going on to the highest results, He may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> those whom He has made to confess, also to be crowned. I bid you, dearest and most beloved brethren, ever heartily farewell in the Lord; and may you attain to the crown of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Victor the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and those who are with me, greet you.</p>
