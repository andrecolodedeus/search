<h1>Epistle 82</h1>

<p><strong>To the Clergy and People Concerning His Retirement, a Little Before His Martyrdom.</strong></p>

<p> <em>Argument.&mdash; When, Near the End of His Life, Cyprian, on Returning to His Gardens, Was Told that Messengers Were Sent to Take Him for Punishment to Utica, He Withdrew. And Lest It Should Be Thought that He Had Done So from Fear of Death, He Gives the Reason in This Letter, Viz., that He Might Undergo His Martyrdom Nowhere Else Than at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, in the Sight of His Own People. A.D. 258.</em></p>

<p>1. Cyprian to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and all the people, greeting. When it had been told to us, dearest brethren, that the jailers  had been sent to bring me to Utica, and I had been persuaded by the counsel of those dearest to me to withdraw for a time from my gardens, as a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> reason was afforded I consented. For the reason that it is fit for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in that city in which he presides over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord, there to confess the Lord, and that the whole people should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the confession of their prelate in their presence. For whatever, in that moment of confession, the confessor-<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> speaks, he speaks in the mouth of all, by inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  But the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of our Church, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> as it is, will be mutilated if I, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> placed over another church, receiving my sentence or my confession at Utica, should go thence as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to the Lord, when indeed, both for my own sake and yours, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with continual supplications, and with all my desires entreat, that I may confess among you, and there suffer, and thence depart to the Lord even as I ought. Therefore here in a hidden retreat I await the arrival of the proconsul returning to <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, that I may hear from him what the emperors have commanded upon the subject of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and may say what the Lord will wish to be said at that hour.</p>

<p>2. But do you, dearest brethren, according to the discipline which you have ever received from me out of the Lord's commands, and according to what you have so very often learned from my discourse, keep peace and tranquillity; nor let any of you stir up any tumult for the brethren, or voluntarily offer himself to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For when apprehended and delivered up, he ought to speak, inasmuch as the Lord abiding in us speaks in that hour, who willed that we should rather confess than profess. But for the rest, what it is fitting that we should observe before the proconsul passes sentence on me for the confession of the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we will with the instruction of the Lord arrange in common.  May our Lord make you, dearest brethren, to remain safe in His Church, and condescend to keep you. So be it through His mercy.</p>
