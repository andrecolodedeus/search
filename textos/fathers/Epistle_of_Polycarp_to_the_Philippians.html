<h1>Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians</h1> 

<h2>Greeting</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>  with him, to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> sojourning at Philippi: Mercy to you, and peace from God Almighty, and from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, our Saviour, be multiplied.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1. Praise of the Philippians</h2>

<p>I have greatly rejoiced with you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, because you have followed the example  of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> [as displayed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>], and have accompanied, as became you, those who were bound in chains, the fitting ornaments of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and which are indeed the diadems of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> elect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and our Lord; and because the strong root of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, spoken of in days <span class="stiki" id="note010340"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse5">Philippians&nbsp;1:5</a></span> long gone by, endures even until now, and brings forth fruit to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> suffered even unto death, [but] <q>whom God raised from the dead, having loosed the bands of the grave.</q>  <q>In whom, though now you see Him not, you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and believing, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> unspeakable and full of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010342"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:8</a></span> into which <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> many desire to enter, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that <q>by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you are saved, not of works,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010343"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;2:8-9</a></span> but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. An exhortation to virtue</h2>

<p><q>Wherefore, girding up your loins,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010344"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:13</a>; <a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> <q>serve the Lord in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a></q>  and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as those who have forsaken the vain, empty talk and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the multitude, and <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him who raised up <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> from the dead, and gave Him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010346"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:21</a></span> and a throne at His right hand. To Him all things <span class="stiki" id="note010347"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:22</a>; <a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse10">Philippians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> in heaven and on earth are subject. Him every spirit serves. He comes as the Judge of the living and the dead. <span class="stiki" id="note010348"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse31">Acts&nbsp;17:31</a></span> His blood will God require of those who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.  But He who raised Him up from the dead will raise  up us also, if we do His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and walk in His commandments, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what He loved, keeping ourselves from all unrighteousness, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking, false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; <q>not rendering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or railing for railing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010351"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:9</a></span> or blow for blow, or cursing for cursing, but being mindful of what the Lord said in His teaching: <q>Judge not, that you be not judged; <span class="stiki" id="note010352"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;7:1</a></span> forgive, and it shall be forgiven unto you;  be merciful, that you may obtain mercy; <span class="stiki" id="note010354"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;6:36</a></span> with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010355"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;7:2</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;6:38</a></span> and once more, <q>Blessed are the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and those that are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Expressions of personal unworthiness</h2>

<p>These things, brethren, I write to you concerning righteousness, not because I take anything upon myself, but because you have invited me to do so. For neither I, nor any other such one, can come up to the wisdom <span class="stiki" id="note010357"><a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:15</a></span> of the blessed and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. He, when among you, accurately and steadfastly taught the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the presence of those who were then alive. And when absent from you, he wrote you a letter,  which, if you carefully study, you will find to be the means of building you up in that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has been given you, and which, being followed by hope, and preceded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and our neighbour, <q>is the mother of us all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010359"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse26">Galatians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> For if any one be inwardly  possessed of these graces, he has fulfilled the command of righteousness, since he that has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is far from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Various exhortations</h2>

<p><q>But the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010360"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:10</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a>, therefore, that <q>as we brought nothing into the world, so we can carry nothing out,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010361"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:7</a></span> let us arm ourselves with the armour of righteousness; <span class="stiki" id="note010362"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;6:11</a></span> and let us teach, first of all, ourselves to walk in the commandments of the Lord. Next, [teach] your wives [to walk] in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> given to them, and in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and purity tenderly loving their own husbands in all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and loving all [others] equally in all <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; and to train up their children in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Teach the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> to be discreet as respects the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> continually <span class="stiki" id="note010363"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> for all, being far from all <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandering</a>, evil-speaking, false-witnessing, <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, and every kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that they are the altar  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He clearly perceives all things, and that nothing is hid from Him, neither reasonings, nor reflections, nor any one of the secret things of the heart.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The duties of deacons, youths, and virgins</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a>, then, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not mocked,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010365"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse7">Galatians&nbsp;6:7</a></span> we ought to walk worthy of His commandment and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. In like manner should the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> be blameless before the face of His righteousness, as being the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  and not of men. They must not be slanderers, double-tongued, <span class="stiki" id="note010367"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:8</a></span> or lovers of money, but temperate in all things, compassionate, industrious, walking according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Lord, who was the servant <span class="stiki" id="note010368"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;20:28</a></span> of all. If we please Him in this present world, we shall receive also the future world, according as He has promised to us that He will raise us again from the dead, and that if we live  worthily of Him, <q>we shall also reign together with Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010370"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:12</a></span> provided only we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. In like manner, let the young men also be blameless in all things, being especially careful to preserve purity, and keeping themselves in, as with a bridle, from every kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For it is well that they should be cut off from  the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> that are in the world, since <q>every <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the spirit;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010372"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:11</a></span> and <q>neither fornicators, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010373"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9-10</a></span> nor those who do things inconsistent and unbecoming. Wherefore, it is needful to abstain from all these things, being subject to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, as unto God and Christ. The <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> also must walk in a blameless and pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The duties of presbyters and others</h2>

<p>And let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> be compassionate and merciful to all, bringing back those that wander, visiting all the sick, and not neglecting the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, the orphan, or the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, but always <q>providing for that which is becoming in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010374"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;12:17</a>; <a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse31">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:31</a></span> abstaining from all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judgment; keeping far off from all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, not quickly crediting [an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report] against any one, not severe in judgment, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that we are all under a debt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If then we entreat the Lord to forgive us, we ought also ourselves to forgive; <span class="stiki" id="note010375"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12-14</a></span> for we are before the eyes of our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <q>we must all appear at the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and must every one give an account of himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010376"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;14:10-12</a>; <a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> Let us then serve Him in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and with all reverence, even as He Himself has commanded us, and as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> unto us, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who proclaimed beforehand the coming of the Lord [have alike taught us]. Let us be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the pursuit of that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, keeping ourselves from causes of offense, from false brethren, and from those who in hypocrisy bear the name of the Lord, and draw away vain men into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Avoid the Docet&aelig;, and persevere in fasting and prayer</h2>

<p><q>For whosoever does not confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh, is antichrist;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010377"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:3</a></span> and whosoever does not confess the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>,  is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and whosoever perverts the oracles of the Lord to his own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and says that there is neither a resurrection nor a judgment, he is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.  Wherefore, forsaking the vanity of many, and their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a>, let us return to the word which has been handed down to us from <span class="stiki" id="note010380"><a href="../bible/jud001.htm#verse3">Jude&nbsp;3</a></span> the beginning; <q>watching unto <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010381"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:7</a></span> and persevering in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; beseeching in our supplications the all-seeing God <q>not to lead us into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010382"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;6:13</a>; <a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a></span>  as the Lord has said: <q>The spirit <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is willing, but the flesh is weak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010383"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a>; <a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse38">Mark&nbsp;14:38</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Persevere in hope and patience</h2>

<p>Let us then continually persevere in our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, and the earnest of our righteousness, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <q>who bore our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in His own body on the tree,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010384"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:24</a></span> <q>who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was guile found in His mouth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010385"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:22</a></span> but endured all things for us, that we might live in Him. <span class="stiki" id="note010386"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:9</a></span> Let us then be imitators of His patience; and if we suffer <span class="stiki" id="note010387"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse41">Acts&nbsp;5:41</a>; <a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:16</a></span> for His name's sake, let us glorify Him.  For He has set us this example <span class="stiki" id="note010389"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:21</a></span> in Himself, and we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that such is the case.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Patience inculcated</h2>

<p>I exhort you all, therefore, to yield <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the word of righteousness, and to exercise all patience, such as you have seen [set] before your eyes, not only in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">blessed Ignatius</a>, and Zosimus, and Rufus, but also in others among yourselves, and in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. [This do] in the assurance that all these have not run <span class="stiki" id="note010390"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse16">Philippians&nbsp;2:16</a>; <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> in vain, but in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness, and that they are [now] in their due place in the presence of the Lord, with whom also they suffered. For they loved not this present world, but Him who died for us, and for our sakes was raised again by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the dead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Exhortation to the practice of virtue</h2> 

<p>Stand fast, therefore, in these things, and follow the example of the Lord, being firm and unchangeable in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, loving the brotherhood, <span class="stiki" id="note010392"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:17</a></span> and being attached to one another, joined together in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, exhibiting the meekness of the Lord in your intercourse with one another, and despising no one. When you can do good, defer it not, because <q><a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> delivers from death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010393"><a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse10">Tobit&nbsp;4:10</a>,&nbsp;<a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse9">Tobit&nbsp;12:9</a></span> Be all of you subject one to another <span class="stiki" id="note010394"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:5</a></span> <q>having your conduct blameless among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010395"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:12</a></span> that you may both receive praise for your good works, and the Lord may not be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> through you. But woe to him by whom the name of the Lord is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>! <span class="stiki" id="note010396"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;52:5</a></span> Teach, therefore, sobriety to all, and manifest it also in your own conduct.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Expression of grief on account of Valens</h2>

<p>I am greatly grieved for Valens, who was once a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> among you, because he so little understands the place that was given him [in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>]. I exhort you, therefore, that you abstain from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>,  and that you be chaste and truthful. <q>Abstain from every form of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010398"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:22</a></span> For if a man cannot govern himself in such matters, how shall he enjoin them on others? If a man does not keep himself from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>,  he shall be defiled by <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and shall be judged as one of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. But who of us are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the judgment of the Lord? <q>Do we not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall judge the world?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010400"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:2</a></span> as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> teaches. But I have neither seen nor heard of any such thing among you, in the midst of whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> laboured, and who are commended  in the beginning of his Epistle. For he boasts of you in all those Churches which alone then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Lord; but we [of Smyrna] had not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him. I am deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him (Valens) and his wife; to whom may the Lord grant <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance! And be then moderate in regard to this matter, and <q>do not count such as enemies,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010402"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> but call them back as suffering and straying members, that you may save your whole body. For by so acting you shall edify yourselves. <span class="stiki" id="note010403"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:26</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Exhortation to various graces</h2>

<p>For I trust that you are well versed in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>, and that nothing is hid from you; but to me this privilege is not yet granted.  It is declared then in these Scriptures, <q>Be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not,</q>  and, <q>Let not the sun go down upon your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010406"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> Happy is he who remembers  this, which I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be the case with you. But may the God and Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> Himself, who is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and our everlasting High Priest, build you up in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and in all meekness, gentleness, patience, long-suffering, forbearance, and purity; and may He bestow on you a lot and portion among His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and on us with you, and on all that are under heaven, who shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in our Lord  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and in His Father, who <q>raised Him from the dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note010408"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Pray for all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Pray also for kings, <span class="stiki" id="note010409"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:2</a></span> and potentates, and princes, and for those that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, <span class="stiki" id="note010410"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> and for the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, that your fruit may be manifest to all, and that you may be perfect in Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Concerning the transmission of epistles</h2>

<p>Both you and <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>  wrote to me, that if any one went [from this] into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, he should carry your letter  with him; which request I will attend to if I find a fitting opportunity, either personally, or through some other acting for me, that your desire may be fulfilled. The Epistles of Ignatius written by him  to us, and all the rest [of his Epistles] which we have by us, we have sent to you, as you requested. They are subjoined to this Epistle, and by them you may be greatly profited; for they treat of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and patience, and all things that tend to edification in our Lord. Any  more certain information you may have obtained respecting both <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> himself, and those that were  with him, have the goodness to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>  to us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Conclusion</h2>

<p>These things I have written to you by Crescens, whom up to the present  time I have recommended unto you, and do now recommend. For he has acted blamelessly among us, and I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also among you. Moreover, you will hold his sister in esteem when she comes to you. Be safe in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Grace be with you all.  <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
