<h1>Excerpts of Theodotus</h1>

<p><strong>Selections from the Prophetic Scriptures</strong></p> 

<p>I. Those around Sedrach, Misak, and Abednago in the furnace of fire say as they praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Bless, you heavens, the Lord; praise and exalt Him for ever;</q> then, <q>Bless, you <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the Lord;</q> then, <q>Bless the Lord, all you waters that are above heaven.</q> So the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> assign the heavens and the waters to the class of pure powers  as is shown in Genesis. Suitably, then, inasmuch as <q>power</q> is used with a variety of meaning, Daniel adds, <q>Let every power bless the Lord;</q> then, further, <q>Bless the Lord, sun and moon;</q> and, <q>Bless the Lord, you stars of heaven. Bless the Lord, all you that worship <em>Him;</em> praise and confess the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods, for His mercy is for ever.</q> It is written in Daniel, on the occasion of the three children praising in the furnace.</p>

<p>II. <q>Blessed are You, who looks on the abysses as You sit on the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>,</q> says Daniel, in agreement with <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>,  who said, <q>And I saw all sorts of matter.</q> For the abyss, which is in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> boundless, is bounded by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These material essences then, from which the separate genera and their species are produced, are called abysses; since you would not call the water alone the abyss, although matter is allegorically called water, the abyss.</p>

<p>III. <q>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080200"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> both terrestrial and celestial things. And that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the Lord said to Osee, <q>Go, take to yourself a wife of fornication, and children of fornication: because the land committing fornication, shall commit fornication, <em>departing</em> from the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080201"><a href="../bible/hos001.htm#verse2">Hosea&nbsp;1:2</a></span> For it is not the element <em>of earth</em> that he speaks of, but those that dwell in the element, those who have an earthly disposition.</p>

<p>IV. And that the Son is the beginning  <em>or head</em>, Hosea teaches clearly: <q>And it shall be, that in the place in which it was said to them, You are not my people, they shall be called the children of the living God: and the children of Judah and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be gathered to the same place, and they shall place over them one head,  and they shall come up out of the land; for great is the day of Jezreel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080204"><a href="../bible/hos001.htm#verse10">Hosea&nbsp;1:10-11</a></span> For whom one believes, him He chooses. But one believes the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who is the head; wherefore also he said in addition: <q>But I will have mercy on the sons of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080205"><a href="../bible/hos001.htm#verse7">Hosea&nbsp;1:7</a></span> Now the Saviour who saves is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. He is then the head. </p>

<p>V. The Spirit by Osee says, <q>I am your Instructor;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080207"><a href="../bible/hos005.htm#verse2">Hosea&nbsp;5:2</a></span> <q>Blow  the trumpet upon the hills of the Lord; sound upon the high places.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080209"><a href="../bible/hos005.htm#verse8">Hosea&nbsp;5:8</a></span> And is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself, which is the sign of regeneration, an escape from matter, by the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, a great impetuous stream, ever rushing on and bearing us along? The Lord accordingly, leading us out of disorder, illumines us by bringing us into the light, which is shadowless and is material no longer.</p>

<p>VI. This river and sea of matter two <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>  cut asunder and divided by the power of the Lord, the matter being bounded, through both divisions of the water. Famous leaders both, by whom the signs were <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, they complied with the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that the righteous man may proceed from matter, having journeyed through it first. On the one of these commanders also was imposed the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>. </p>

<p>VII. Now, regeneration is by water and spirit, as was all creation: <q>For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> moved on the abyss.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080212"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> And for this reason the Saviour was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, though not Himself needing  to be so, in order that He might consecrate the whole water for those who were being regenerated. Thus it is not the body only, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that we cleanse. It is accordingly a sign of the sanctifying of our invisible part, and of the straining off from the new and spiritual creation of the unclean spirits that have got mixed up with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>VIII. <q>The water above the heaven.</q> Since <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is performed by water and the Spirit as a protection against the twofold fire&mdash;that which lays hold of what is visible, and that which lays hold of what is invisible; and of necessity, there being an immaterial element of water and a material, is it a protection against the twofold  fire. And the earthly water cleanses the body; but the heavenly water, by reason of its being immaterial and invisible, is an emblem of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who is the purifier of what is invisible, as the water of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, as the other of the body.</p>

<p>IX. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, out of goodness, has mingled <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> with goodness. For what is beneficial for each one, that He also supplies, as a physician to a sick man, as a father to his insubordinate child: <q>For he that spares his rod <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080215"><a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse24">Proverbs&nbsp;13:24</a></span> And the Lord and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> walked in the midst of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and labours. When, then, the affliction is sent in the person of a righteous man,  it is either from the Lord rebuking him for a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed before, or guarding him on account of the future, or not preventing by the exercise of His power an assault from without, &mdash; for some good end to him and to those near, for the sake of example.</p>

<p>X. Now those that dwell in a corrupt body, like those who sail in an old ship, do not lie on their back, but are ever <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, stretching their hands to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>XI. The ancients were exceedingly distressed, unless they had always some suffering in the body. For they were afraid, that if they received not in this world the punishment of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which, in numbers through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, accompany those that are in the flesh, they would in the other world suffer the penalty all at once. So that they preferred curative treatment here. What is to be dreaded is, then, not external disease, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for which disease <em>comes</em>, and disease of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not of the body: <q>For all flesh is grass,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080218"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;40:6</a></span> and corporeal and external <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are temporary; <q>but the things which are unseen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080219"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> </p>

<p>XII. As to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, some elements of it we already possess; others, by what we do possess, we firmly hope <em>to attain</em>. For neither have we attained all, nor do we lack all. But we have received, as it were, an earnest of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessings, and of the ancestral riches. The provisions for the Lord's way are the Lord's beatitudes. For He said: <q>Seek,</q> and anxiously seek, <q>the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and all these things shall be added to you: for the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what things you have need of.</q>  Thus He limits not only our occupations, but our cares. For He says: <q>You cannot, by taking thought, add anything to your stature.</q>  For God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> well what it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us to have and what to want. He wishes, therefore, that we, emptying ourselves of worldly cares, should be filled with that which is directed towards God. <q>For we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with that which is incorruptible, before putting off corruption.</q> For when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is shed abroad, unbelief is nonplussed. Similarly also with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and righteousness. We must therefore not only empty the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but fill it with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For no longer is there <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in it, since that has been made to cease; nor yet is there good, since it has not yet received good. But what is neither good nor <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is nothing. <q>For to the swept and empty house return,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080222"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;12:44</a></span> if none of the blessings of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has been put in, the unclean spirit that dwelt there before, taking with him seven other unclean spirits. Wherefore, after emptying the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, we must fill with the good God that which is His chosen dwelling-place. For when the empty rooms are filled, then follows the seal, that the sanctuary may be guarded for God.</p>

<p>XIII. <q>By two and three witnesses every word is established.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080223"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;17:6</a></span> By Father, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, by whose <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and help the prescribed commandments ought to be kept. </p>

<p>XIV. Fasting, according to the signification of the word, is abstinence from food. Now food makes us neither more righteous nor less. But <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> it shows that, as life is maintained in individuals by sustenance, and want of sustenance is the token of death; so also ought we to fast from worldly things, that we may die to the world, and after that, by partaking of divine sustenance, live to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Especially does <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> empty the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of matter, and make it, along with the body, pure and light for the divine words. Worldly food is, then, the former life and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but the divine food is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, patience, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, peace, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. For <q>blessed are they that hunger and thirst after</q> God's <q>righteousness; for they shall be filled.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080225"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;5:6</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but not the body, it is which is susceptible of this craving.</p>

<p>XV. The Saviour showed to the believing <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to be stronger than <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the case of a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a>, whom they could not cleanse, when He said, Such things are accomplished by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. He who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> has obtained forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the Lord; but he who has attained <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, inasmuch as he no longer <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, obtains from himself the forgiveness of the rest.</p>

<p>XVI. For as cures, and prophecies, and signs are performed by the agency of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, God working in them, so also is <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> teaching. For God shows His power through men. And the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> rightly says, <q>I will send to them a man who will save them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080226"><a href="../bible/isa019.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;19:20</a></span> Accordingly He sends forth at one time <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, at another <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, to be saviours of men. Thus God does good by the agency of men. For it is not that God can do some things, and cannot do others: He is never powerless in anything. No more are some things done with, and some things against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; and some things by Him, and some things by another. But He even brought us into being by means of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and trained us by means of men.</p>

<p>XVII. God made us, having previously no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For if we had a previous <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, we must have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> where we were, and how and why we came hither. But if we had no pre-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, then God is the sole author of our creation. As, then, He made us who had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; so also, now that we are made, He saves us by His own <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, if we show ourselves worthy and susceptible; if not, He  will let us pass to our proper end. For He is Lord both of the living and the dead.</p>

<p>XVIII. But see the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only in the case of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in bringing to <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> out of non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and making them when brought into being grow up according to the progress of the time of life, but also in saving those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, in a way suitable to each individual. And now He changes both hours, and times, and fruits, and elements. For this is the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has measured both the beginning and the end of events suitably to each one.</p>

<p>XIX. Advancing from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to say Lord, Lord; but not as His slave, he has learned to say, Our Father.  Having set free the spirit of bondage, which produces <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and advanced by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to adoption, he now reverences from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him whom he feared before. For he no longer abstains from what he ought to abstain from out of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> clings to the commandments. <q>The Spirit itself,</q> it is said, <q>bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> when we cry, Abba,  Father.</q> </p>

<p>XX. Now the Lord with His precious blood redeems us, freeing us from our old bitter masters, that is, our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, on account of which the spiritual <em>powers</em> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> ruled over us. Accordingly He leads us into the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>&mdash;sons that are co-heirs and friends. <q>For,</q> says the Lord, <q>they that do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my Father are my brethren and fellow-heirs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080231"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse50">Matthew&nbsp;12:50</a></span> <q>Call no man, therefore, father to yourselves on earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080232"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;23:9</a></span> For it is masters that are on earth. But in heaven is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom is the whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, both in heaven and on earth. <span class="stiki" id="note080233"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse15">Ephesians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> rules willing <em>hearts</em>, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the unwilling. One kind of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is base; but the other, leading us as a pedagogue to good, brings us to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and is saving.</p>

<p>XXI. Now if one has a conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it by no means corresponds with His worthiness. For what can the worthiness of God be? But let him, as far as is possible, conceive of a great and incomprehensible and most beautiful light; inaccessible, comprehending all good power, all comely <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; caring for all, compassionate, passionless, good; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things, foreknowing all things, pure, sweet, shining, stainless.</p>

<p>XXII. Since the movement of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is self-originated, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God demands from it what the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possesses, willingness as its contribution to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> wishes to be its own good; which the Lord, <em>however</em>, gives it. For it is not devoid of sensation so as to be carried along like a body. Having is the result of taking, and taking of willing and desiring; and keeping hold of what one has received, of the exercise of care and of ability. Wherefore God has endowed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with free choice, that He may show it its duty, and that it choosing, may receive and retain.</p>

<p>XXIII. As through the body the Lord spoke and healed, so also formerly by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and now by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and teachers. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the minister of the Lord's power. Thence He then assumed humanity,  that by it He might minister to the Father's will. And at all times, the God who loves humanity  invests Himself with man for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;in former times with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and now with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For it is fitting that like should minister to like, in order to a like <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>XXIV. For we are of the earth....C&aelig;sar is the prince, for the time being, whose earthly image is the old man, to which he has returned. To him, then, we are to render the earthly things, which we bore in the image of the earthly, and the things of God to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For each one of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is on us as a letter, and stamp, and sign. Now the Lord marks us with another stamp, and with other names and letters, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> instead of unbelief, and so forth. Thus we are translated from what is material to what is spiritual, <q>having borne the image of the heavenly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080236"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse49">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:49</a></span> </p>

<p>XXV. John says: <q>I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water, but there comes after me He that baptizes with the Spirit and fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080237"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span> But He <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> no one with fire. But some, as Heraclius says, marked with fire the ears of those who were sealed; understanding so the apostolic saying, <q>For His fan is in His hand, to purge His floor: and He will gather the wheat into the garner; but the chaff He will burn with fire unquenchable.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080238"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;3:12</a></span> There is joined, then, the expression <q>by fire</q> to that <q>by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>;</q> since He separates the wheat from the chaff, that is, from the material husk, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; and the chaff is separated, being fanned by the wind:  so also the Spirit possesses a power of separating material forces. Since, then, some things are produced from what is unproduced and indestructible,&mdash; that is, the germs of life&mdash;the wheat also is stored, and the material part, as long as it is conjoined with the superior part, remains; when separated from it, it is destroyed; for it had its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in another thing. This separating element, then, is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the destroying element is the fire: and material fire is to be understood. But since that which is saved is like wheat, and that which grows in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> like chaff, and the one is incorporeal, and that which is separated is material; to the incorporeal He opposes spirit, which is rarefied and pure&mdash; almost more so than mind; and to the material <em>He opposes</em> fire, not as being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> or bad, but as strong and capable of cleansing away <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For fire is conceived as a good force and powerful, destructive of what is baser, and conservative of what is better. Wherefore this fire is by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> called wise.</p>

<p>XXVI. Thus also, then, when God is called <q>a consuming fire,</q> it is because a name and sign, not of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but of power, is to be selected. For as fire is the most potent of the elements, and masters all things; so also God is all-powerful and almighty, who is able to hold, to create, to make, to nourish, to make grow, to save, having power of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. As, then, fire is superior to the elements, so is the Almighty Ruler to gods, and powers, and principalities. The power of fire is twofold: one power conduces to the production and maturing of fruits and of animals, of which the sun is the image; and the other to consumption and destruction, as terrestrial fire. When, then, God is called a consuming fire, <em>He is called</em> a mighty and resistless power, to which nothing is impossible, but which is able to destroy.</p>

<p>Respecting such a power, also, the Saviour says, <q>I came to send fire upon the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080240"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> indicating a power to purify what is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but destructive, as they say, of what is material; and, as we should say, disciplinary. Now <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> pertains to fire, and diffusion to light.</p>

<p>XXVII. Now the more ancient men  did not write, as they neither wished to encroach on the time devoted to attention bestowed on what they handed down, in the way of teaching, by the additional attention bestowed on writing, nor spent the time for considering what was to be said on writing. And, perhaps convinced that the function of composition and the department of teaching did not belong to the same cast of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, they gave way to those who had a natural turn for it. For in the case of a speaker, the stream of speech flows unchecked and impetuous, and you may catch it up hastily. But that which is always tested by readers, meeting with strict  examination, is thought worthy of the utmost pains, and is, so to speak, the written confirmation of <em>oral</em> instruction, and of the voice so wafted along to posterity by written composition. For that which was committed in trust to the elders, speaking in writing, uses the writer's help to hand itself down to those who are to read it. As, then, the magnet, repelling other matter, attracts iron alone by reason of affinity; so also books, though many read them, attract those alone who are capable of comprehending them. For the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to some <q>foolishness,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080243"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> and to others a <q>stumbling-block;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080244"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> but to a few <q>wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080245"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> So also is the power of God found to be. But far from the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> be <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. For it is for this reason also that he asks whether it be worse to give to the unworthy, or not commit to the worthy; and runs the risk, from his abundant <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of communicating, not only to every one who is qualified, but sometimes also to one unworthy, who asks importunately; not on account of his entreaty (for he loves not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>), but on account of the persistency of the petitioner who bends his mind towards <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with copious entreaty.</p>

<p>XXVIII. There are those calling themselves <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a> who are <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> of those in their own house more than strangers. And, as the sea is open to all, but one swims, another sails, and a third catches fish; and as the land is common, but one walks, another ploughs, another hunts,&mdash; somebody else searches the mines, and another builds a house: so also, when the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is read, one is helped to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, another to morality, and a third is freed from <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things. The athlete, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Olympic stadium, strips for training, contends, and becomes victor, tripping up his antagonists who contend against his scientific method, and fighting out the contest. For scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>  is necessary both for the training of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and for gravity of conduct; making the faithful more active and keen observers of things. For as there is no believing without elementary instruction, so neither is there comprehension without science. </p>

<p>XXIX. For what is useful and necessary to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, such as <em>the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of</em> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and also of our own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are wholly requisite; and it is at once beneficial and necessary to attain to the scientific account of them. And to those who have assumed the lead in doing good, much experience is advantageous; so that none of the things which appear to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> necessarily and eruditely by others may escape their notice. The exposition, too, of heterodox teaching affords another exercise of the inquiring <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and keeps the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> from being seduced from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by his having already had practice beforehand in sounding all round on warlike instruments of music. </p>

<p>XXX. The life of the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> rule, (as they say that Crete was barren of deadly animals,) is pure from every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a>, and thought, and word; not only hating no one, but beyond <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, and all evil-speaking and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>.</p>

<p>XXXI. In length of days, it is not on account of his having lived long that the man is to be regarded <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, to whose lot it has also fallen, through his having lived, to be worthy of living for ever. He has pained no one, except in instructing by the word the wounded in heart, as it were by a salutary honey, which is at once sweet and pungent. So that, above all, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> preserves the decorous along with that which is in accordance with reason. For passion being cut away and stript off from the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he henceforth consorts and lives with what is noblest, which has now become pure, and emancipated to adoption.</p>

<p>XXXII. Pythagoras thought that he who gave things their names, ought to be regarded not only the most intelligent, but the oldest of the wise men. We must, then, search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> accurately, since they are admitted to be expressed in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and from the names hunt out the thoughts which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, propounding respecting things, teaches by imprinting His <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so to speak, on the expressions; that the names used with various meanings, being made the subject of accurate investigation, may be explained, and that that which is hidden under many integuments may, being handled and learned, come to light and gleam forth. For so also lead turns white as you rub it; white lead being produced from black. So also scientific <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (gnosis), shedding its light and brightness on things, shows itself to be in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the divine wisdom, the pure light, which illumines the men whose eyeball is clear, unto the sure vision and comprehension of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>XXXIII. Lighting, then, our torch  at the source of that light, by the passionate desire which has it for its object, and striving as much as possible to be assimilated to it, we become men  full of light,  <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> indeed. For He called those friends and brethren who by desire and pursuit aimed after likeness to the Divinity.</p>

<p>XXXIV. Pure places and meadows have received voices and visions of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> phantasms.  But every man who has been perfectly purified, shall be thought worthy of divine teaching and of power.</p>

<p>XXXV. Now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of science (gnosis) are a laughing-stock to many, especially when not patched up with sophistical figurative language. And the few are at first startled at them; as when light is suddenly brought into a convivial party in the dark. Subsequently, on getting used and accustomed, and trained to reasoning, as if gladdened and exulting for delight, they <em>praise</em> the Lord....For as pleasure has for its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> release from pain; so also has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the removal of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For as those that are most asleep think they are most awake, being under the power of dream-visions very vivid and fixed; so those that are most <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> think that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most. But blessed are they who rouse themselves from this sleep and derangement, and raise their eyes to the light and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>XXXVI. It is, therefore, equally requisite for him who wishes to have a pupil who is docile, and has blended <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with aspiration, to exercise himself and constantly to study by himself, investigating the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his speculations; and when he thinks himself right, to descend to questions regarding things contiguous. For the young birds make attempts to fly in the nest, exercising their wings.</p>

<p>XXXVII. For <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostic</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> everywhere makes man good, and meek, and harmless,  and painless, and blessed, and ready to associate in the best way with all that is divine, in the best way with men, at once a contemplative and active divine image, and turns him into a lover of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,  as there it is contemplated and comprehended by wisdom, is here by self-control and righteousness carried into effect through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: practising in the flesh an angelic ministry; hallowing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the body, as in a place clear and stainless.</p>

<p>XXXVIII. Against <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>,  who says that the words, <q>Let there be light,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080256"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;1:3</a></span> are supplicatory. If, then, He is supplicating the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how does He say, <q>I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and beside me there is none else?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080257"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;44:6</a></span> We have said that there are punishments for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, for nonsense, for outrageous expressions; which are punished and chastised by reason.</p>

<p>XXXIX. And he said, too, that on account of their hair and finery, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are punished by the Power that is set over these matters; which also gave to Samson strength in his hair; which punishes the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who allure to fornication through the adornment of their hair.</p>

<p>XL. As by the effluence of good, people are made good; in like manner are they made bad. Good is the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the discrimination of the believing from the unbelieving, and the judgment beforehand, so as not to fall into greater judgment&mdash; this judgment being correction.</p>

<p>XLI. <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that infants which are exposed are delivered to a guardian <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and that by him they are trained and reared. <q>And they shall be,</q> it says, <q>as the faithful in this world of a hundred years of age.</q> Wherefore also Peter, in the Revelation,  says: <q>And a flash of fire, leaping from those infants, and striking the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</q> For the just shines: forth as a spark in a reed, and will judge the nations. <span class="stiki" id="note080259"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse7">Wisdom&nbsp;3:7</a></span> </p>

<p>XLII. <q>With the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> You will be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q>  <q>According to your praise is your name <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>;</q> God being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> through our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and through the inheritance. Thus also it is said, <q>The Lord lives,</q> and <q>The Lord has risen.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080261"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;24:34</a></span> </p>

<p>XLIII. <q>A people whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not has served me;</q> &mdash; by covenant I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them not, alien sons, who desired what pertained to another.</p>

<p>XLIV. <q>Magnifying the salvations of His king.</q>  All the faithful are called kings, brought to royalty through inheritance.</p>

<p>XLV. Long-suffering is sweetness above honey; not because it is long-suffering, but in consequence of the fruit of long-suffering. Since, then, the man of self-control is devoid of passion, inasmuch as he restrains the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, not without toil; but when habit is formed, he is no longer a man of self-control, the man having come under the influence of one habit and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>XLVI. The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that are in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are called spirits,&mdash; not spirits of power, since in that case the man under the influence of passion would be a legion of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; but <em>they are so called</em> in consequence of the impulse they communicate. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, through modifications, taking on this and that other sort of qualities of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, is said to receive spirits.</p>

<p>XLVII. The Word does not bid us renounce property;  but to manage property without inordinate affection; and on anything happening, not to be vexed or grieved; and not to desire to acquire. <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> bids keep away from possession accompanied with passion, and from all inordinate affection, and <em>from this</em> turns back those still remaining  in the flesh.</p>

<p>XLVIII. For instance, Peter says in the Apocalypse,  that abortive infants shall share the better <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>;  that these are committed to a guardian <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, so that, on receiving <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, they may obtain the better abode, having had the same experiences which they would have had had they been in the body. But the others shall obtain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> merely, as being injured and pitied, and remain without punishment, receiving this reward.</p>

<p>XLIX. The milk of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, flowing from the breasts and thickening, says Peter in the Apocalypse,  will produce minute beasts, that prey on flesh, and running back into them will consume them: teaching that punishments arise for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. He says that they are produced from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; as it was for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that the people were sold. And for their want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as the apostle says, they were bitten by serpents.</p>

<p>L. An ancient said that the embryo is a living thing; for that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> entering into the womb after it has been by cleansing prepared for conception, and introduced by one of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who preside over generation, and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the time for conception, moves the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to intercourse; and that, on the seed being deposited, the spirit, which is in the seed, is, so to speak, appropriated, and is thus assumed into conjunction in the process of formation. He cited as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to all, how, when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> give glad tidings to the barren, they introduce <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> before conception. And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <q>the babe leapt</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080269"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;1:43</a></span> as a living thing. And the barren are barren for this reason, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which unites for the deposit of the seed, is not introduced so as to secure conception and generation.</p>

<p>LI. <q>The heavens declare the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  The heavens are taken in various meanings, both those defined by space and revolution, and those by covenant&mdash;the immediate operation of the first-created <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For the covenants caused a more special appearance of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;that  in the case of Adam, that in the case of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, that in the case of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that in the case of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. For, moved by the Lord, the first-created <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> exercised their influence on the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> attached to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, considering the covenants the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Furthermore, the things done on earth by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were done by the first-created <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>LII. It is the Lord that is principally denominated the Heavens, and then the First-created; and after these also the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men before the Law, as the patriarchs, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; then also the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. <q>And the firmament shows His handiwork.</q> He applies the term <q>firmament</q>  to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the passionless and immoveable, as also elsewhere the same David says, <q>I will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> You, O Lord, my strength  and my refuge.</q>  Accordingly, the firmament itself shows forth the work of His hands&mdash;that is, shows and manifests the work of His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For He shows forth and manifests those whom He has made.</p>

<p>LIII. <q>Day unto day utters speech.</q> As the heavens have various meanings, so also has day. Now speech is the Lord; and He is also frequently called day. <q>And night unto night shows forth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the Lord was to come. But he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore also he tempted Him, in order to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> if He were powerful. It is said, <q>he left  Him, and departed from Him for a season;</q> that is, he postponed the discovery till the resurrection. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He who was to rise was the Lord. Likewise also the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; since also they suspected that Solomon was the Lord, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he was not so, on his sinning. <q>Night to night.</q> All the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He who rose after the passion was the Lord. And already <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>  had said, that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who transgressed taught men astronomy and <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, and the rest of the arts.</p>

<p>LIV. <q>There are no speeches or words whose voices are not heard,</q> neither of days nor nights. <q>Their sound is gone forth unto all the earth.</q> He has transferred the discourse to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> alone, whom he calls both heavens and days.</p>

<p>LV. The stars, spiritual bodies, that have communications with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> set over them, and are governed by them, are not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the production of things, but are signs of what is taking place, and will take place, and have taken place in the case of atmospheric changes, of fruitfulness and barrenness, of pestilence and fevers, and in the case of men. The stars do not in the least degree exert influences, but indicate what is, and will be, and has been.</p>

<p>LVI. <q>And in the sun has He set His tabernacle.</q> There is a transposition here. For it is of the second coming that the discourse is. So, then, we must read what is transposed in its due sequence: <q>And he, as a bridegroom issuing from his chamber, will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as a giant to run his way. From heaven's end is his going forth; and there is no one who shall hide himself from his heat;</q> and then, <q>He has set His tabernacle in the sun.</q></p>

<p>Some say that He deposited the Lord's body in the sun, as Hermogenes. And <q>His tabernacle,</q> some say, is His body, others the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.</p>

<p>Our Pant&aelig;nus  used to say, that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> utters its expressions indefinitely for the most part, and uses the present for the future, and again the present for the past. Which is also seen here.  For <q>He has set</q> is put both for the past and the future. For the future, because, on the completion of this period, which is to run according to its present  constitution, the Lord will come to restore the righteous, the faithful, in whom He rests, as in a tent, to one and the same unity; for all are one body, of the same race, and have chosen the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness. But some as head, some as eyes, some as ears, some as hands, some as breasts, some as feet, shall be set, resplendent, in the sun. <q>Shine forth as the sun,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080280"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse43">Matthew&nbsp;13:43</a></span> or in the sun; since an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> high in command is in the sun. For he is appointed for rule over days; as the moon is for ruling over night. <span class="stiki" id="note080281"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;1:18</a></span> Now <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are called days. Along with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in  the sun, it is said, they shall have assigned to them one abode, to be for some time and in some respects the sun, as it were the head of the body which is one. And, besides, they also are the rulers of the days, as that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in the sun, for the greater purpose for which he before them  migrated to the same place. And again destined to ascend progressively, they reach the first abode, in accordance with the past <q>He has set:</q> so that the first-created <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall no longer, according to <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, exercise a definite ministry, but may be in repose, and devoted to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of God alone; while those next to them shall be promoted to the post which they have left; and so those beneath them similarly.</p>

<p>LVII. There are then, according to the apostle, those on the summit,  the first-created. And they are thrones, although Powers, being the first-created, inasmuch as God rests in them, as also in those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For each one, according to his own stage of advancement possesses the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a way special to himself; and in this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> God reposes, those who possess <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> being made <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. And is not <q>He set His tabernacle in the sun</q> to be understood thus? God <q>set in the sun,</q> that is, in the God who is beside Him, as in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, Eli, Eli,  instead of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my God. And what is <q>above all rule, and authority, and power, and every name that is named,</q> are those from among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that are made perfect as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and archangels, <em>so as to rise</em> to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> first-created. For those who are changed from men to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are instructed for a thousand years by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> after they are brought to perfection. Then those who have taught are translated to archangelic authority; and those who have learned instruct those again who from men are changed to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Thus afterwards, in the prescribed periods, they are brought to the proper angelic state of the body.</p>

<p>LVIII. <q>The law of God is perfect, converting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q>  The Saviour Himself is called Law and Word, as Peter in <q>the Preaching,</q> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>Out of Zion shall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note080287"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;2:3</a></span> </p>

<p>LIX. <q>The testimony of the Lord is sure, making children wise.</q> The covenant of the Lord is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, making wise children; those free from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, both the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and then also us. Besides, the testimony of the Lord, according to which He rose again after His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, having been verified by fact, led the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to confirmation in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>LX. <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is pure, enduring for ever.</q> He says that those who have been turned from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness endure for ever.</p>

<p><q>The judgments of the Lord are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q>&mdash; sure, and incapable of being overturned; and giving rewards according to what is right, bringing the righteous to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For this is shown in the words, <q>justified for the same.</q>  <q>Such desires  are above gold and precious stone.</q></p>

<p>LXI. <q>For also Your servant keeps them.</q> Not that David alone is called servant; but the whole people saved is called the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in virtue of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the command.</p>

<p>LXII. <q>Cleanse me from my secret <em>faults</em>;</q>&mdash; thoughts contrary to right reason&mdash; defects. For He calls this foreign to the righteous man.</p>

<p>LXIII. <q>If they have not dominion over me, then shall I be innocent.</q> If those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> me as they did the Lord, do not have dominion over me, I shall not be innocent. For no one becomes a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> unless he is <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>; nor appears righteous, unless, being wronged, he takes no revenge; nor forbearing...</p>
