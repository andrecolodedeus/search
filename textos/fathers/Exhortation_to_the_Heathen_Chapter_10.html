<h1>Exhortation to the Heathen (Chapter 10)</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA</em></strong>

<h2>Chapter 10. Answer to the Objection of the Heathen, that It Was Not Right to Abandon the Customs of Their Fathers.</h2>

<p>But you say it is not creditable to subvert the customs handed down to us from our fathers. And why, then, do we not still use our first nourishment, milk, to which our nurses accustomed us from the time of our birth? Why do we increase or diminish our patrimony, and not keep it exactly the same as we got it? Why do we not still vomit on our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> breasts, or still do the things for which, when infants, and nursed by our mothers, we were laughed at, but have corrected ourselves, even if we did not fall in with good instructors? Then, if excesses in the indulgence of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, though pernicious and dangerous, yet are accompanied with pleasure, why do we not in the conduct of life abandon that usage which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and provocative of passion, and godless, even should our fathers feel hurt, and betake ourselves to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and seek Him who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> our Father, rejecting custom as a deleterious drug? For of all that I have undertaken to do, the task I now attempt is the noblest, viz., to demonstrate to you how inimical this insane and most wretched custom is to godliness. For a boon so great, the greatest ever given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, would never have been <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and rejected, had not you been carried away by custom, and then shut your ears against us; and just as unmanageable horses throw off the reins, and take the bit between their teeth, you rush away from the arguments addressed to you, in your eager desire to shake yourselves clear of us, who seek to guide the chariot of your life, and, impelled by your folly, dash towards the precipices of destruction, and regard the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> word of God as an accursed thing. The reward of your choice, therefore, as described by Sophocles, follows:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>The mind a blank, useless ears, vain thoughts.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>And you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that, of all truths, this is the truest, that the good and godly shall obtain the good reward, inasmuch as they held goodness in high esteem; while, on the other hand, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall receive meet punishment. For the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, torment has been prepared; and so the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Zecharias threatens him: <q>He that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you; lo, is not this a brand plucked from the fire?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note020976"><a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse2">Zechariah&nbsp;3:2</a></span> What an infatuated desire, then, for <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> death is this, rooted in men's minds! Why do they flee to this fatal brand, with which they shall be burned, when it is within their power to live nobly according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not according to custom? For God bestows life freely; but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom, after our departure from this world, brings on the sinner unavailing remorse with punishment. <em>By sad experience, even a child <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a></em> how <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> destroys and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> saves. Let any of you look at those who minister before the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, their hair matted, their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> disgraced with filthy and tattered clothes; who never come near a bath, and let their nails grow to an extraordinary length, like wild beasts; many of them castrated, who show the idol's temples to be in reality graves or prisons. These appear to me to bewail the gods, not to worship them, and their sufferings to be worthy of pity rather than <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. And seeing these things, do you still continue blind, and will you not look up to the Ruler of all, the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>? And will you not escape from those dungeons, and flee to the mercy that comes down from heaven? For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of His great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, comes to the help of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as the mother-bird flies to one of her young that has fallen out of the nest; and if a serpent open its mouth to swallow the little bird, <q>the mother flutters round, uttering cries of grief over her dear progeny;</q>  and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father seeks His creature, and heals his transgression, and pursues the serpent, and recovers the young one, and incites it to fly up to the nest.</p>

<p>Thus dogs that have strayed, track out their master by the scent; and horses that have thrown their riders, come to their master's call if he but whistle. <q>The ox,</q> it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> his owner, and the ass his master's crib; but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note020978"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> What, then, of the Lord? He remembers not our ill desert; He still pities, He still urges us to repentance.</p> 

<p>And I would ask you, if it does not appear to you monstrous, that you men who are God's handiwork, who have received your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from Him, and belong wholly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should be subject to another master, and, what is more, serve the tyrant instead of the rightful King&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one instead of the good? For, in the name of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, what man in his senses turns his back on good, and attaches himself to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? What, then, is he who flees from God to consort with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? Who, that may become a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, prefers to be in bondage? Or who is he that pursues his way to Erebus, when it is in his power to be a citizen of heaven, and to cultivate Paradise, and walk about in heaven and partake of the tree of life and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and, cleaving his way through the sky in the track of the luminous cloud, behold, like Elias, the rain of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Some there are, who, like worms wallowing in marshes and mud in the streams of pleasure, feed on foolish and useless delights&mdash; swinish men. For swine, it is said, like mud better than pure water; and, according to Democritus, <q>doat upon dirt.</q></p>

<p>Let us not then be enslaved or become swinish; but, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> children of the light, let us raise our eyes and look on the light, lest the Lord discover us to be spurious, as the sun does the eagles. Let us therefore repent, and pass from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, from foolishness to wisdom, from licentiousness to self-restraint, from unrighteousness to righteousness, from godlessness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is an enterprise of noble daring to take our way to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the enjoyment of many other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things is within the reach of the lovers of righteousness, who pursue <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, specially those things to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself alludes, speaking by Isaiah: <q>There is an inheritance for those who serve the Lord .</q> <span class="stiki" id="note020979"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;54:17</a></span> Noble and desirable is this inheritance: not gold, not silver, not raiment, which the moth assails, and things of earth which are assailed by the robber, whose eye is dazzled by worldly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; but it is that treasure of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to which we must hasten, by becoming lovers of the Word. Thence praise-worthy works descend to us, and fly with us on the wing of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This is the inheritance with which the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> covenant of God invests us, conveying the everlasting gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and thus our loving Father&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Father&mdash; ceases not to exhort, admonish, train, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us. For He ceases not to save, and advises the best course: <q>Become righteous,</q> says the Lord.  You that thirst, come to the water; and you that have no money, come, and buy and drink without money. <span class="stiki" id="note020981"><a href="../bible/isa055.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;55:1</a></span> He invites to the laver, to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, to illumination, all but crying out and saying, The land I give you, and the sea, my child, and heaven too; and all the living creatures in them I freely bestow upon you. Only, O child, thirst for your Father; God shall be revealed to you without price; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not made merchandise of. He gives you all creatures that fly and swim, and those on the land. These the Father has created for your thankful enjoyment. What the bastard, who is a son of perdition, foredoomed to be the slave of <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, has to buy for money, He assigns to you as your own, even to His own son who loves the Father; for whose sake He still works, and to whom alone He promises, saying, <q>The land shall not be sold in perpetuity,</q> for it is not destined to corruption. <q>For the whole land is mine;</q> and it is yours too, if you receive God. Wherefore the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, as might have been expected, proclaims good news to those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. <q>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the Lord shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and His power.</q> What <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, tell me, O blessed One, which <q>eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note020982"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> and <q>they shall be glad in the kingdom of their Lord for ever and ever! <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> You have, O men, the divine promise of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; you have heard, on the other hand, the threatening of punishment: by these the Lord saves, teaching men by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Why do we delay? Why do we not shun the punishment? Why do we not receive the free gift? Why, in fine, do we not choose the better part, God instead of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one, and prefer wisdom to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, and take life in exchange for death? <q>Behold,</q> He says, <q>I have set before your face death and life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note020983"><a href="../bible/deu030.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;30:15</a></span> The Lord tries you, that <q>you may choose life.</q> He counsels you as a father to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> God. <q>For if you hear Me,</q> He says, <q>and be willing, you shall eat the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the land:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note020984"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;1:19</a></span> this is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> attached to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. <q>But if you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Me not, and are unwilling, the sword and fire shall devour you:</q>  this is the penalty of disobedience. For the mouth of the Lord&mdash; the law of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the word of the Lord&mdash; has spoken these things. Are you willing that I should be your good counsellor? Well, do you hear. I, if possible, will explain. You ought, O men, when reflecting on the Good, to have brought forward a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> inborn and competent, viz., <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which of itself, and from its own resources, chooses at once what is best, instead of occupying yourselves in painfully inquiring whether what is best ought to be followed. For, allow me to tell you, you ought to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether you should get drunk, but you get drunk before reflecting on the matter; and whether you ought to do an injury, but you do injury with the utmost readiness. The only thing you make the subject of question is, whether God should be worshipped, and whether this wise God and Christ should be followed: and this you think requires deliberation and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what is worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in us, as you have in <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, that you may be wise; have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in us, as you have in injury, that you may live. But if, acknowledging the conspicuous trustworthiness of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, you wish to trust them, come and I will set before you in abundance, materials of persuasion respecting the Word. But do you&mdash; for your ancestral customs, by which your minds are preoccupied, divert you from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;do you now hear what is the real state of the case as follows.</p>

<p>And let not any shame of this name preoccupy you, which does great harm to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and seduces them from <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Let us then openly strip for the contest, and nobly strive in the arena of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Word being the judge, and the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> prescribing the contest. For 'tis no insignificant prize, the reward of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> which is set before us. Pay no more regard, then, if you are rated by some of the low rabble who lead the dance of impiety, and are driven on to the same pit by their folly and insanity, makers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and worshippers of stones. For these have dared to deify men,&mdash; Alexander of Macedon, for example, whom they canonized as the thirteenth god, whose pretensions <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> confuted, which showed him dead. I admire, therefore, the divine sophist. Theocritus was his name. After Alexander's death, Theocritus, holding up the vain opinions entertained by men respecting the gods, to ridicule before his fellow citizens, said: <q>Men, keep up your hearts as long as you see the gods dying sooner than men.</q> And, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, he who worships gods that are visible, and the promiscuous rabble of creatures begotten and born, and attaches himself to them, is a far more wretched object than the very <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For God is by no manner of means unrighteous, as the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are, but in the very highest degree righteous; and nothing more resembles God than one of us when he becomes righteous in the highest possible degree:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Go into the way, the whole tribe of you handicrafts-men, <br>Who worship Jove's fierce-eyed daughter,  the working goddess, <br>With fans duly placed, fools that you are</q>&mdash;

</p></blockquote><p>fashioners of stones, and worshippers of them. Let your Phidias, and Polycletus, and your Praxiteles and <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a> too, come, and all that are engaged in mechanical arts, who, being themselves of the earth, are workers of the earth. <q>For then,</q> says a certain <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, <q>the affairs here turn out unfortunately, when men put their trust in images.</q> Let the meaner artists, too&mdash; for I will not stop calling&mdash; come. None of these ever made a breathing image, or out of earth moulded soft flesh. Who liquefied the marrow? Or who solidified the bones? Who stretched the nerves? Who distended the veins? Who poured the blood into them? Or who spread the skin? Who ever could have made eyes capable of seeing? Who breathed spirit into the lifeless form? Who bestowed righteousness? Who promised <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>? The Maker of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> alone; the Great Artist and Father has formed us, such a living image as man is. But your Olympian Jove, the image of an image, greatly out of harmony with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is the senseless work of Attic hands. For the image of God is His Word, the genuine Son of Mind, the Divine Word, the archetypal light of light; and the image of the Word is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man, the mind which is in man, who is therefore said to have been made <q>in the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note020987"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> assimilated to the Divine Word in the affections of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and therefore rational; but effigies sculptured in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, the earthly image of that part of man which is visible and earth-born, are but a perishable impress of humanity, manifestly wide of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. That life, then, which is occupied with so much earnestness about matter, seems to me to be nothing else than full of insanity. And custom, which has made you taste bondage and unreasonable care, is fostered by vain opinion; and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, which has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of unlawful <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and delusive shows, and also of deadly plagues and hateful images, has, by devising many shapes of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, stamped on all that follow it the mark of long-continued death. Receive, then, the water of the word; wash, you polluted ones; purify yourselves from custom, by sprinkling yourselves with the drops of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  The pure must ascend to heaven. You are a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if we look to that which is most common to you and others&mdash; seek Him who created you; you are a son, if we look to that which is your peculiar prerogative&mdash; acknowledge your Father. But do you still continue in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, engrossed with pleasures? To whom shall the Lord say, <q>Yours is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>?</q> Yours, whose choice is set on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you will; yours, if you will only <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and comply with the brief terms of the announcement; which the Ninevites having <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, instead of the destruction they looked for, obtained a signal deliverance. How, then, may I ascend to heaven, is it said? The Lord is the way; a strait way, but leading from heaven, strait in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but leading back to heaven, strait, despised on earth; broad, adored in heaven.</p>

<p>Then, he that is uninstructed in the word, has <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as the excuse of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; but as for him into whose ears instruction has been poured, and who deliberately maintains his incredulity in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the wiser he appears to be, the more harm will his understanding do him; for he has his own sense as his accuser for not having chosen the best part. For man has been otherwise constituted by nature, so as to have fellowship with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As, then, we do not compel the horse to plough, or the bull to hunt, but set each animal to that for which it is by nature fitted; so, placing our finger on what is man's peculiar and distinguishing characteristic above other creatures, we invite him&mdash; born, as he is, for the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of heaven, and being, as he is, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> heavenly plant&mdash; to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, counselling him to furnish himself with what is his sufficient provision for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, namely <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Practise husbandry, we say, if you are a husbandman; but while you till your fields, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. Sail the sea, you who are devoted to navigation, yet call the while on the heavenly Pilot.  Has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> taken hold of you while engaged in military service? Listen to the commander, who orders what is right. As those, then, who have been overpowered with sleep and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, do you awake; and using your eyes a little, consider what mean those stones which you worship, and the expenditure you frivolously lavish on matter. Your means and substance you squander on <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, even as you throw away your lives to death, having found no other end of your vain hope than this. Not only unable to pity yourselves, you are incapable even of yielding to the persuasions of those who commiserate you; enslaved as you are to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom, and, clinging to it voluntarily till your last breath, you are hurried to destruction: <q>because light has come into the world, and men have loved the darkness rather than the light,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note020990"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;3:19</a></span> while they could sweep away those hindrances to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, repeating this poetic utterance:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Whither do I bear these abundant riches? And whither <br>Do I myself wander?</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>If you wish, then, to cast aside these vain phantasies, and bid adieu to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom, say to vain opinion:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Lying dreams, farewell; you were then nothing.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>For what, think you, O men, is the Hermes of Typho, and that of Andocides, and that of Amyetus? Is it not evident to all that they are stones, as is the veritable Hermes himself? As the Halo is not a god, and as the Iris is not a god, but are states of the atmosphere and of the clouds; and as, likewise, a day is not a god, nor a year, nor time, which is made up of these, so neither is sun nor moon, by which each of those mentioned above is determined. Who, then, in his right senses, can <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> Correction, and Punishment, and Justice, and Retribution to be gods? For neither the Furies, nor the Fates, nor Destiny are gods, since neither Government, nor Glory, nor Wealth are gods, which last [as Plutus] painters represent as blind. But if you deify Modesty, and Love, and Venus, let these be followed by Infamy, and Passion, and Beauty, and Intercourse. Therefore Sleep and Death cannot reasonably any more be regarded as twin deities, being merely changes which take place naturally in living creatures; no more will you with propriety call Fortune, or Destiny, or the Fates goddesses. And if Strife and Battle be not gods, no more are Ares and Enyo. Still further, if the lightnings, and thunderbolts, and rains are not gods, how can fire and water be gods? How can shooting stars and comets, which are produced by atmospheric changes? He who calls Fortune a god, let him also so call Action. If, then, none of these, nor of the images formed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hands, and destitute of feeling, is held to be a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> exercised about us is evidently the result of a divine power,  it remains only to acknowledge this, that He alone who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is and subsists. But those who are insensible to this are like men who have drunk mandrake or some other drug. May God grant that you may at length awake from this slumber, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that neither Gold, nor Stone, nor Tree, nor Action, nor Suffering, nor Disease, nor Fear, may appear in your eyes as a god. For there are, in truth, <q>on the fruitful earth thrice ten thousand</q> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, nor indeed mortal; for they are not endowed with sensation, so as to render them capable of death, but only things of wood and stone, that hold despotic sway over men insulting and violating life through the force of custom. <q>The earth is the Lord's,</q> it is said, <q>and the fullness thereof.</q>  Then why do you dare, while luxuriating in the bounties of the Lord, to ignore the Sovereign Ruler? <q>Leave my earth,</q> the Lord will say to you. <q>Touch not the water which I bestow. Partake not of the fruits of the earth produced by my husbandry.</q> Give to God recompense for your sustenance; acknowledge your Master. You are God's creature. What belongs to Him, how can it with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be alienated? For that which is alienated, being deprived of the properties that belonged to it, is also deprived of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For, after the fashion of Niobe, or, to express myself more <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>, like the Hebrew <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> called by the ancients <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife, are you not turned into a state of insensibility? This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, we have heard, was turned into stone for her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. And those who are godless, addicted to impiety, hard-hearted and foolish, are Sodomites. Believe that these utterances are addressed to you from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For think not that stones, and stocks, and birds, and serpents are sacred things, and men are not; but, on the contrary, regard men as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> sacred,  and take beasts and stones for what they are. For there are miserable wretches of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kind, who consider that God utters His voice by the raven and the jackdaw, but says nothing by man; and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the raven as a messenger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who croaks not, nor chatters, but speaks rationally and instructs lovingly, alas, they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>; and while he is inviting them to cultivate righteousness, they try inhumanly to slay him, neither welcoming the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which comes from above, nor fearing the penalty. For they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor understand His power, whose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to man is ineffable; and His <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is inconceivable. His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> augments punishment against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> bestows blessings on repentance. It is the height of wretchedness to be deprived of the help which comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence this blindness of eyes and dulness of hearing are more grievous than other inflictions of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one; for the one deprives them of heavenly vision, the other robs them of divine instruction. But you, thus maimed as respects the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, blind in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, deaf in understanding, are not grieved, are not pained, have had no desire to see heaven and the Maker of heaven, nor, by fixing your choice on <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, have sought to hear the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, and to learn of Him; for no hindrance stands in the way of him who is bent on the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Neither childlessness, nor poverty, nor obscurity, nor want, can hinder him who eagerly strives after the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor does any one who has conquered  by brass or iron the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom for himself choose to exchange it, for it is vastly preferred to everything else. Christ is able to save in every place. For he that is fired with ardour and admiration for righteousness, being the lover of One who needs nothing, needs himself but little, having treasured up his bliss in nothing but himself and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where is neither moth, <span class="stiki" id="note020996"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;6:20-21</a></span> robber, nor pirate, but the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Giver of good. With <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, then, have you been compared to those serpents who shut their ears against the charmers. For <q>their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>is like the serpent, like the deaf adder, which stops her ear, and will not hear the voice of the charmers.</q>  But allow yourselves to feel the influence of the charming strains of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, and receive that mild word of ours, and reject the deadly poison, that it may be granted to you to divest yourselves as much as possible of destruction, as they  have been divested of old age. Hear me, and do not stop your ears; do not block up the avenues of hearing, but lay to heart what is said. Excellent is the medicine of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>! Stop at length your grovelling reptile motions.  <q>For the enemies of the Lord,</q> says Scripture, <q>shall lick the dust.</q>  Raise your eyes from earth to the skies, look up to heaven, admire the sight, cease watching with outstretched head the heel of the righteous, and hindering the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Be wise and harmless. Perchance the Lord will endow you with the wing of simplicity (for He has resolved to give wings to those that are earth-born), that you may leave your holes and dwell in heaven. Only let us with our whole heart repent, that we may be able with our whole heart to contain God. <q>Trust in Him, all you assembled people; pour out all your hearts before Him.</q>  He says to those that have newly abandoned <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, <q>He pities them, and fills them with righteousness.</q> Believe Him who is man and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, O man. Believe, O man, the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who suffered and is adored. Believe, you slaves,  Him who died; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, all you of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> kind, Him who alone is God of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Believe, and receive <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> as your reward. Seek <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live. He who seeks God is busying himself about his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Have you found God?&mdash; then you have life. Let us then seek, in order that we may live. The reward of seeking is life with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Let all who seek You be glad and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in You; and let them say continually, God be magnified.</q>  A noble hymn of God is an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> man, established in righteousness, in whom the oracles of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are engraved. For where but in a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is wise can you write <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Where <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Where reverence? Where meekness? Those who have had these divine characters impressed on them, ought, I think, to regard wisdom as a fair port whence to embark, to whatever lot in life they turn; and likewise to deem it the calm haven of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: wisdom, by which those who have betaken themselves to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> good fathers to their children; and good <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to their sons, those who have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Son; and good husbands to their wives, those who remember the Bridegroom; and good masters to their servants,  those who have been redeemed from utter slavery. Oh, happier far the beasts than men involved in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>! Who live in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> as you, but do not counterfeit the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. There are no tribes of flatterers among them. Fishes have no <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>: the birds worship not a single image; only they look with admiration on heaven, since, deprived as they are of reason, they are unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. So are you not ashamed for living through so many periods of life in impiety, making yourselves more irrational than irrational creatures? You were boys, then striplings, then youths, then men, but never as yet were you good. If you have respect for old age, be wise, now that you have reached life's sunset; and albeit at the close of life, acquire the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the end of life may to you prove the beginning of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. You have become old in <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; as young, enter on the practice of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. God regards you as innocent children. Let, then, the Athenian follow the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Solon, and the Argive those of Phoroneus, and the Spartan those of Lycurgus: but if you enrol yourself as one of God's people, heaven is your country, God your lawgiver. And what are the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>? <q>You shall not kill; you shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; you shall not seduce boys; you shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>; you shall not bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021005"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;20:13-16</a>; <a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:5</a></span> And the complements of these are those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of reason and words of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> which are inscribed on men's hearts: <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself; to him who strikes you on the cheek, present also the other;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021006"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;6:29</a></span> <q>you shall not <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, for by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> alone you have committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021007"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> How much better, therefore, is it for men from the beginning not to wish to desire things forbidden, than to obtain their desires! But you are not able to endure the austerity of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but as we delight in sweet things, and prize them higher for the agreeableness of the pleasure they yield, while, on the other hand, those bitter things which are distasteful to the palate are curative and healing, and the harshness of medicines strengthens people of weak stomach, thus custom pleases and tickles; but custom pushes into the abyss, while <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> conducts to heaven. Harsh it is at first, but a good nurse of youth; and it is at once the decorous place where the household maids and matrons dwell together, and the sage council-chamber. Nor is it difficult to approach, or impossible to attain, but is very near us in our very homes; as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, endowed with all wisdom, says, while referring to it, it has its abode in three departments of our constitution&mdash; in the hands, the mouth, and the heart: a meet emblem this of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which is embraced by these three things in all&mdash; will, action, speech. And be not afraid lest the multitude of pleasing objects which rise before you withdraw you from wisdom. You yourself will spontaneously surmount the frivolousness of custom, as boys when they have become men throw aside their toys. For with a celerity unsurpassable, and a benevolence to which we have ready access, the divine power, casting its radiance on the earth, has filled the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> with the seed of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For it was not without divine care that so great a work was accomplished in so brief a space by the Lord, who, though despised as to appearance, was in reality adored, the expiator of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, the clement, the Divine Word, He that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> most manifest Deity, He that is made equal to the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; because He was His Son, and the Word was in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not disbelieved in by all when He was first preached, nor altogether unknown when, assuming the character of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and fashioning Himself in flesh, He enacted the drama of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: for He was a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> champion and a fellow-champion with the creature. And being communicated most speedily to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, having dawned from His Father's counsel quicker than the sun, with the most perfect ease He made God shine on us. Whence He was and what He was, He showed by what He taught and exhibited, manifesting Himself as the Herald of the Covenant, the Reconciler, our Saviour, the Word, the Fount of life, the Giver of peace, diffused over the whole face of the earth; by whom, so to speak, the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> has already become an ocean of blessings. </p>
