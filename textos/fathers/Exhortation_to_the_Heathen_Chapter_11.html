<h1>Exhortation to the Heathen (Chapter 11)</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA</em></strong>

<h2>Chapter 11. How Great are the Benefits Conferred on Man Through the Advent of Christ.</h2>

<p>Contemplate a little, if agreeable to you, the divine beneficence. The first man, when in Paradise, sported free, because he was the child of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but when he succumbed to pleasure (for the serpent allegorically signifies pleasure crawling on its belly, earthly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> nourished for fuel to the flames), was as a child seduced by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and grew old in disobedience; and by disobeying his Father, dishonoured God. Such was the influence of pleasure. Man, that had been free by reason of simplicity, was found fettered to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The Lord then wished to release him from his bonds, and clothing Himself with flesh&mdash; O divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>!&mdash; vanquished the serpent, and enslaved the tyrant death; and, most marvellous of all, man that had been deceived by pleasure, and bound fast by corruption, had his hands unloosed, and was set free. O mystic wonder! The Lord was laid low, and man rose up; and he that fell from Paradise receives as the reward of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> something greater [than Paradise]&mdash; namely, heaven itself. Wherefore, since the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself has come to us from heaven, we need not, I reckon, go any more in search of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> learning to Athens and the rest of Greece, and to Ionia. For if we have as our teacher Him that filled the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> with His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> energies in creation, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, beneficence, legislation, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, teaching, we have the Teacher from whom all instruction comes; and the whole world, with Athens and Greece, has already become the domain of the Word.  For you, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the poetical fable which designated Minos the Cretan as the bosom friend of Zeus, will not refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we who have become the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of God have received the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom; and that which the chiefs of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> only guessed at, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Christ have both apprehended and proclaimed. And the one whole Christ is not divided: <q>There is neither barbarian, nor Jew, nor Greek, neither male nor female, but a new man,</q>  transformed by God's <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Further, the other counsels and precepts are unimportant, and respect particular things&mdash;as, for example, if one may marry, take part in public affairs, beget children; but the only command that is universal, and over the whole course of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, at all times and in all circumstances, tends to the highest end, viz., life, is <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, &mdash; all that is necessary, in order that we may live for ever, being that we live in accordance with it. Philosophy, however, as the ancients say, is <q>a long-lived exhortation, wooing the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of wisdom;</q> while the commandment of the Lord is far-shining, <q>enlightening the eyes.</q> Receive Christ, receive sight, receive your light,</p>

<blockquote><p><q>In order that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> 

</p></blockquote><p><q>Sweet is the Word that gives us light, precious above gold and gems; it is to be desired above honey and the honey-comb.</q>  For how can it be other than desirable, since it has filled with light the mind which had been buried in darkness, and given keenness to the <q>light-bringing eyes</q> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? For just as, had the sun not been in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, night would have brooded over the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> notwithstanding the other luminaries of heaven; so, had we nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Word, and been illuminated by Him; we should have been nowise different from fowls that are being fed, fattened in darkness, and nourished for death. Let us then admit the light, that we may admit <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; let us admit the light, and become <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. This, too, He has been promised to the Father: <q>I will declare Your name to my brethren; in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> will I praise You.</q>  Praise and declare to me Your Father <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; Your utterances save; Your hymn teaches  that hitherto I have wandered in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, seeking God. But since You lead me to the light, O Lord, and I find God through You, and receive the Father from You, I become <q>Your fellow-heir,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021016"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;8:17</a></span> since You <q>were not ashamed of me as Your brother.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021017"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse11">Hebrews&nbsp;2:11</a></span> Let us put away, then, let us put away oblivion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, viz., <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; and removing the darkness which obstructs, as dimness of sight, let us contemplate the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, first raising our voice in this hymn of praise:  Hail, O light! For in us, buried in darkness, shut up in the shadow of death, light has shone forth from heaven, purer than the sun, sweeter than life here below. That light is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and whatever partakes of it lives. But night fears the light, and hiding itself in terror, gives place to the day of the Lord. Sleepless light is now over all, and the west has given credence to the east. For this was the end of the new creation. For <q>the Sun of Righteousness,</q> who drives His chariot over all, pervades equally all humanity, like <q>His Father, who makes His sun to rise on all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> and distils on them the dew of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. He has changed sunset into sunrise, and through the cross brought death to life; and having wrenched man from destruction, He has raised him to the skies, transplanting mortality into <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and translating earth to heaven&mdash; He, the husbandman of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Pointing out the favourable signs and rousing the nations <br>To good works, putting them in mind of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sustenance;</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>having bestowed on us the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> great, divine, and inalienable inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, deifying man by heavenly teaching, putting His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> into our minds, and writing them on our hearts. What <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> does He inscribe? <q>That all shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from small to great;</q> and, <q>I will be merciful to them,</q> says <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>and will not remember their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021020"><a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse10">Hebrews&nbsp;8:10-12</a>; <a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse33">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:33-34</a></span> Let us receive the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of life, let us comply with God's expostulations; let us become acquainted with Him, that He may be gracious. And though God needs nothing let us render to Him the grateful recompense of a thankful heart and of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, as a kind of house-rent for our dwelling here below.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Gold for brass, <br>A hundred oxen's worth for that of nine;</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>that is, for your little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> He gives you the earth of so great extent to till, water to drink and also to sail on, air to breathe, fire to do your work, a world to dwell in; and He has permitted you to conduct a colony from here to heaven: with these important works of His hand, and benefits in such numbers, He has rewarded your little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Then, those who have put <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in necromancers, receive from them amulets and charms, to ward off <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> forsooth; and will you not allow the heavenly Word, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, to be bound on to you as an amulet, and, by trusting in God's own charm, be delivered from <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> which are the diseases of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and rescued from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?&mdash; for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death. Surely utterly dull and blind, and, like moles, doing nothing but eat, you spend your lives in darkness, surrounded with corruption. But it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which cries, <q>The light shall shine forth from the darkness.</q> Let the light then shine in the hidden part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is, the heart; and let the beams of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> arise to reveal and irradiate the hidden inner man, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Light, the familiar friend and fellow-heir of Christ; especially now that we have come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the most precious and venerable name of the good Father, who to a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and good child gives gentle counsels, and commands what is salutary for His child. He who obeys Him has the advantage in all things, follows <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, obeys the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him through wandering, loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, loves his neighbour, fulfils the commandment, seeks the prize, claims the promise. But it has been God's fixed and constant purpose to save the flock of men: for this end the good God sent the good Shepherd. And the Word, having unfolded the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, showed to men the height of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that either repenting they might be saved, or refusing to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, they might be judged. This is the proclamation of righteousness: to those that <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, glad tidings; to those that disobey, judgment. The loud trumpet, when sounded, collects the soldiers, and proclaims <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. And shall not Christ, breathing a strain of peace to the ends of the earth, gather together His own soldiers, the soldiers of peace? Well, by His blood, and by the word, He has gathered the bloodless host of peace, and assigned to them the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. The trumpet of Christ is His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. He has blown it, and we have heard. <q>Let us array ourselves in the armour of peace, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, and taking the shield of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and binding our brows with the helmet of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and the sword of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which is the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021022"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;6:14-17</a></span> let us sharpen. So the apostle in the spirit of peace commands. These are our invulnerable weapons: armed with these, let us face the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one; <q>the fiery darts of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one</q> let us quench with the sword-points dipped in water, that, have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the Word, returning grateful thanks for the benefits we have received, and honouring God through the Divine Word. <q>For while you are yet speaking,</q> it is said, <q>He will say, Behold, I am beside you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021023"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;58:9</a></span> O this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed power, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has fellowship with men! Better far, then, is it to become at once the imitator and the servant of the best of all beings; for only by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> service will any one be able to imitate <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to serve and worship Him only by imitating Him. The heavenly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> comes to men thus, when in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself the spark of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> goodness, kindled in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the Divine Word, is able to burst forth into flame; and, what is of the highest importance, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> runs parallel with sincere willingness&mdash; choice and life being, so to speak, yoked together. Wherefore this exhortation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> alone, like the most faithful of our friends, abides with us till our last breath, and is to the whole and perfect spirit of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the kind attendant on our ascent to heaven. What, then, is the exhortation I give you? I urge you to be saved. This Christ desires. In one word, He freely bestows life on you. And who is He? Briefly learn. The Word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the Word of incorruption, that regenerates man by bringing him back to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; the goad that urges to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash; He who expels destruction and pursues death&mdash; He who builds up the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in men, that He may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God to take up His abode in men. Cleanse the temple; and pleasures and amusements abandon to the winds and the fire, as a fading flower; but wisely cultivate the fruits of self-command, and present yourself to God as an offering of <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, that there may be not the work alone, but also the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and both are requisite, that the friend of Christ may be rendered worthy of the kingdom, and be counted worthy of the kingdom.</p>
