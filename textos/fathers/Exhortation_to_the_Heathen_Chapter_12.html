<h1>Exhortation to the Heathen (Chapter 12)</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA</em></strong>

<h2>Chapter 12. Exhortation to Abandon Their Old Errors and Listen to the Instructions of Christ.</h2>

<p>Let us then avoid custom as we would a dangerous headland, or the threatening Charybdis, or the mythic sirens. It chokes man, turns him away from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, leads him away from life: custom is a snare, a gulf, a pit, a mischievous winnowing fan.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Urge the ship beyond that smoke and billow.</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>Let us shun, fellow-mariners, let us shun this billow; it vomits forth fire: it is a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> island, heaped with bones and corpses, and in it sings a fair courtesan, Pleasure, delighting with music for the common ear.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Hie you hither, far-famed Ulysses, great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Ach&aelig;ans; <br>Moor the ship, that you may hears diviner voice.</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>She praises you, O mariner, and calls the eillustrious; and the courtesan tries to win to herself the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Greeks. Leave her to prey on the dead; a heavenly spirit comes to your help: pass by Pleasure, she beguiles.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Let not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with flowing train cheat you of your senses, <br>With her flattering prattle seeking your hurt.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Sail past the song; it works death. Exert your will only, and you have overcome ruin; bound to the wood of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, you shall be freed from destruction: the word of God will be your pilot, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> will bring you to anchor in the haven of heaven. Then shall you see my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be initiated into the sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and come to the fruition of those things which are laid up in heaven reserved for me, which <q>ear has not heard, nor have they entered into the heart of any.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note021026"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> </p>

<blockquote><p><q>And in truth methinks I see two suns, <br>And a double Thebes,</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>said one frenzy-stricken in the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, intoxicated with mere <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. I would pity him in his frantic intoxication, and thus frantic I would invite him to the sobriety of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; for the Lord welcomes a sinner's repentance, and not his death.</p>

<p>Come, O madman, not leaning on the thyrsus, not crowned with ivy; throw away the mitre, throw away the fawn-skin; come to your senses. I will show you the Word, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Word, expounding them after your own fashion. This is the mountain beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not the subject of tragedies like Cith&aelig;ron, but <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to dramas of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;a mount of sobriety, shaded with forests of purity; and there revel on it not the M&aelig;nades, the sisters of Semele, who was struck by the thunderbolt, practising in their initiatory <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> division of flesh, but the daughters of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the fair lambs, who celebrate the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the Word, raising a sober choral dance. The righteous are the chorus; the music is a hymn of the King of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. The maidens strike the lyre, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> praise, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> speak; the sound of music issues forth, they run and pursue the jubilant band; those that are called make haste, eagerly desiring to receive the Father.</p>

<p>Come also, O aged man, leaving Thebes, and casting away from you both <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> and Bacchic frenzy, allow yourself to be led to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I give you the staff [of the cross] on which to lean. Haste, Tiresias; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and you will see. Christ, by whom the eyes of the blind recover sight, will shed on you a light brighter than the sun; night will flee from you, fire will <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, death will be gone; you, old man, who saw not Thebes, shall see the heavens. O <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> sacred <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>! O stainless light! My way is lighted with torches, and I survey the heavens and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; I become <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> while I am initiated. The Lord is the hierophant, and seals while illuminating him who is initiated, and presents to the Father him who believes, to be kept safe for ever. Such are the reveries of my <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. If it is your wish, be also initiated; and you shall join the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> along with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> around the unbegotten and indestructible and the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, raising the hymn with us.  This Jesus, who is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the one great High Priest of the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of His Father, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for and exhorts men.</p>

<p><q>Hear, you myriad tribes, rather whoever among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are endowed with reason, both barbarians and Greeks. I call on the whole race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whose Creator I am, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father. Come to Me, that you may be put in your due rank under the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> and the one <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; and do not only have the advantage of the irrational creatures in the possession of reason; for to you of all mortals I grant the enjoyment of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For I want, I want to impart to you this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, bestowing on you the perfect boon of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and I confer on you both the Word and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My complete self. This am I, this God wills, this is symphony, this the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, this is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, this is Christ, this the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, the arm of the Lord, the power of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Father; of which things there were images of old, but not all adequate. I desire to restore you according to the original model, that you may become also like Me. I anoint you with the ungent of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by which you throw off corruption, and show you the naked form of righteousness by which you ascend to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Come to Me, all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For My yoke is easy, and My burden light.</q> </p>

<p>Let us haste, let us run, my fellow-men&mdash; us, who are God-loving and God-like images of the Word. Let us haste, let us run, let us take His yoke, let us receive, to conduct us to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, the good charioteer of men. Let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ. He led the colt with its parent; and having yoked the team of humanity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, directs His chariot to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, hastening clearly to fulfil, by driving now into heaven, what He shadowed forth before by riding into Jerusalem. A spectacle most beautiful to the Father is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Son crowned with victory.  Let us aspire, then, after what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; let us become God-loving men, and obtain the greatest of all things which are incapable of being harmed&mdash; God and life. Our helper is the Word; let us put confidence in Him; and never let us be visited with such a craving for silver and gold, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as for the Word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> Himself. For it will not, it will not be pleasing to God Himself if we value least those things which are worth most, and hold in the highest estimation the manifest enormities and the utter impiety of folly, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and thoughtlessness, and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For not improperly the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> consider that the foolish are guilty of profanity and impiety in whatever they do; and describing <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> itself as a species of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, allege that the multitude are nothing but madmen. There is therefore no room to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, the Word will say, whether it is better to be sane or insane; but holding on to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with our teeth, we must with all our might follow <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the exercise of wisdom regard all things to be, as they are, His; and besides, having learned that we are the most excellent of His possessions, let us commit ourselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, loving the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, and regarding this as our business all our life long. And if what belongs to friends be reckoned common property, and man be the friend of God&mdash; for through the mediation of the Word has he been made the friend of God&mdash; then accordingly all things become man's, because all things are God's, and the common property of both the friends, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</p>

<p>It is time, then, for us to say that the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> alone is rich and wise, and of noble birth, and thus call and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him to be God's image, and also His likeness,  having become righteous and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and wise by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and so far already like God. Accordingly this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is indicated by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, when he says, <q>I said that you are gods, and all sons of the Highest.</q>  For us, yea us, He has adopted, and wishes to be called the Father of us alone, not of the unbelieving. Such is then our position who are the attendants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>As are men's wishes, so are their words; <br>As are their words, so are their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; <br>And as their works, such is their life.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Good is the whole life of those who have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ.</p>

<p>Enough, methinks, of words, though, impelled by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I might have gone on to pour out what I had from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I might exhort to what is the greatest of blessings&mdash; <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  For discourses concerning the life which has no end, are not readily brought to the end of their disclosures. To you still remains this conclusion, to choose which will profit you most&mdash; judgment or <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For I do not think there is even room for <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> which of these is the better; nor is it allowable to compare life with destruction.</p>
