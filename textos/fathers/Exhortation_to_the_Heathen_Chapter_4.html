<h1>Exhortation to the Heathen (Chapter 4)</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA</em></strong>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Absurdity and Shamefulness of the Images by Which the Gods are Worshipped.</h2>

<p>If, in addition, I take and set before you for inspection these very images, you will, as you go over them, find how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> silly is the custom in which you have been reared, of worshipping the senseless works of men's hands.</p>

<p>Anciently, then, the Scythians worshipped their sabres, the Arabs stones, the Persians rivers. And some, belonging to other races still more ancient, set up blocks of wood in conspicuous situations, and erected pillars of stone, which were called Xoana, from the carving of the material of which they were made. The image of Artemis in Icarus was doubtless unwrought wood, and that of the Cith&aelig;ronian Here was a felled tree-trunk; and that of the Samian Here, as &AElig;thlius says, was at first a plank, and was afterwards during the government of Proclus carved into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> shape. And when the Xoana began to be made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they got the name of Brete,&mdash; a term derived from Brotos (man). In Rome, the historian Varro says that in ancient times the Xoaron of Mars&mdash; the idol by which he was worshipped&mdash; was a spear, artists not having yet applied themselves to this specious pernicious art; but when art flourished, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> increased. That of stones and stocks&mdash; and, to speak briefly, of dead matter&mdash; you have made images of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form, by which you have produced a counterfeit of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is now as clear as can be; but such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> as the point may demand must not be declined.</p>

<p>That the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Zeus at Olympia, and that of Polias at Athens, were executed of gold and ivory by Phidias, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by everybody; and that the image of Here in Samos was formed by the chisel of Euclides, Olympichus relates in his <em>Samiaca</em>. Do not, then, entertain any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that of the gods called at Athens venerable, Scopas made two of the stone called Lychnis, and Calos the one which they are reported to have had placed between them, as Polemon shows in the fourth of his books addressed to Tim&aelig;us. Nor need you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> respecting the images of Zeus and Apollo at Patara, in Lycia, which Phidias executed, as well as the lions that recline with them; and if, as some say, they were the work of Bryxis, I do not dispute&mdash;you have in him another maker of images. Whichever of these you like, write down. Furthermore, the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> nine cubits in height of Poseidon and Amphitrite, worshipped in Tenos, are the work of Telesius the Athenian, as we are told by Philochorus. Demetrius, in the second book of his <em>Argolics</em>, writes of the image of Here in Tiryns, both that the material was pear-tree and the artist was Argus.</p>

<p>Many, perhaps, may be surprised to learn that the Palladium which is called the Diopetes&mdash; that is, fallen from heaven&mdash; which Diomede and Ulysses are related to have carried off from Troy and deposited at Demophoon, was made of the bones of Pelops, as the Olympian Jove of other bones&mdash; those of the Indian wild beast. I adduce as my authority Dionysius, who relates this in the fifth part of his <em>Cycle</em>. And Apellas, in the <em>Delphics</em>, says that there were two Palladia, and that both were fashioned by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. But that one may suppose that I have passed over them through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, I shall add that the image of Dionysus Morychus at Athens was made of the stones called Phellata, and was the work of Simon the son of Eupalamus, as Polemo says in a letter. There were also two other sculptors of Crete, as I think: they were called Scyles and Dipoenus; and these executed the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the Dioscuri in Argos, and the image of Hercules in Tiryns, and the effigy of the Munychian Artemis in Sicyon. Why should I linger over these, when I can point out to you the great deity himself, and show you who he was&mdash;whom indeed, conspicuously above all, we hear to have been considered worthy of veneration? Him they have dared to speak of as made without hands&mdash; I mean the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Serapis. For some relate that he was sent as a present by the people of Sinope to Ptolemy Philadelphus, king of the Egyptians, who won their favour by sending them grain from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> when they were perishing with famine; and that this idol was an image of Pluto; and Ptolemy, having received the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, placed it on the promontory which is now called Racotis; where the temple of Serapis was held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and the sacred enclosure borders on the spot; and that Blistichis the courtesan having died in Canopus, Ptolemy had her conveyed there, and buried beneath the forementioned shrine.</p>

<p>Others say that the Serapis was a Pontic idol, and was transported with solemn pomp to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>. Isidore alone says that it was brought from the Seleucians, near <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, who also had been visited with a dearth of grain, and had been fed by Ptolemy. But Athenodorns the son of Sandon, while wishing to make out the Serapis to be ancient, has somehow slipped into the mistake of proving it to be an image fashioned by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hands. He says that Sesostris the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> king, having subjugated the most of the Hellenic races, on his return to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> brought a number of craftsmen with him. Accordingly he ordered a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Osiris, his ancestor, to be executed in sumptuous style; and the work was done by the artist Bryaxis, not the Athenian, but another of the same name, who employed in its execution a mixture of various materials. For he had filings of gold, and silver, and lead, and in addition, tin; and of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> stones not one was wanting, and there were fragments of sapphire, and hematite, and emerald, and topaz. Having ground down and mixed together all these ingredients, he gave to the composition a blue colour, whence the darkish hue of the image; and having mixed the whole with the colouring matter that was left over from the funeral of Osiris and Apis, moulded the Serapis, the name of which points to its connection with sepulture and its construction from funeral materials, compounded as it is of Osiris and Apis, which together make Osirapis.</p>

<p>Another new deity was added to the number with great religious pomp in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and was near being so in Greece by the king of the Romans, who deified Antinous, whom he loved as Zeus loved Ganymede, and whose beauty was of a very rare order: for <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is not easily restrained, destitute as it is of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and men now observe the sacred nights of Antinous, the shameful character of which the lover who spent them with him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well. Why reckon him among the gods, who is honoured on account of uncleanness? And why do you command him to be lamented as a son? And why should you enlarge on his beauty? Beauty blighted by <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is loathsome. Do not play the tyrant, O man, over beauty, nor offer foul insult to youth in its bloom. Keep beauty pure, that it may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> fair. Be king over beauty, not its tyrant. Remain free, and then I shall acknowledge your beauty, because you have kept its image pure: then will I worship that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beauty which is the archetype of all who are beautiful. Now the grave of the debauched boy is the temple and town of Antinous. For just as temples are held in reverence, so also are sepulchres, and pyramids, and mausoleums, and labyrinths, which are temples of the dead, as the others are sepulchres of the gods. As teacher on this point, I shall produce to you the Sibyl prophetess:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Not the oracular lie of Ph&oelig;bus, <br>Whom silly men called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> termed Prophet; <br>But the oracles of the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was not made by men's hands, <br>Like dumb <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of Sculptured stone.</q>  

</p></blockquote><p>She also predicts the ruin of the temple, foretelling that that of the Ephesian Artemis would be engulphed by earthquakes and rents in the ground, as follows:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Prostrate on the ground Ephesus shall wail, weeping by the shore, <br>And seeking a temple that has no longer an inhabitant.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>She says also that the temple of Isis and Serapis would be demolished and burned:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Isis, thrice-wretched goddess, you shall linger by the streams of the Nile; <br>Solitary, frenzied, silent, on the sands of Acheron.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Then she proceeds:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>And you, Serapis, covered with a heap of white stones, <br>Shall lie a huge ruin in thrice-wretched <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>But if you attend not to the prophetess, hear at least your own <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, the Ephesian Heraclitus, upbraiding images with their senselessness: <q>And to these images they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, with the same result as if one were to talk to the walls of his house.</q> For are they not to be wondered at who worship stones, and place them before the doors, as if capable of activity? They worship Hermes as a god, and place Aguieus as a doorkeeper. For if people upbraid them with being devoid of sensation, why worship them as gods? And if they are thought to be endowed with sensation, why place them before the door? The Romans, who ascribed their greatest successes to Fortune, and regarded her as a very great deity, took her <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> to the privy, and erected it there, assigning to the goddess as a fitting temple&mdash; the necessary. But senseless wood and stone, and rich gold, care not a whit for either savoury odour, or blood, or smoke, by which, being at once honoured and fumigated, they are blackened; no more do they for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> or insult. And these images are more worthless than any animal. I am at a loss to conceive how objects devoid of sense were deified, and feel compelled to pity as miserable wretches those that wander in the mazes of this folly: for if some living creatures have not all the senses, as worms and caterpillars, and such as even from the first appear imperfect, as moles and the shrew-mouse, which Nicander says is blind and uncouth; yet are they superior to those utterly senseless <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and images. For they have some one sense&mdash;say, for example, hearing, or touching, or something analogous to smell or taste; while images do not possess even one sense. There are many creatures that have neither sight, nor hearing, nor speech, such as the genus of oysters, which yet live and grow, and are affected by the changes of the moon. But images, being motionless, inert, and senseless, are bound, nailed, glued,&mdash; are melted, filed, sawed, polished, carved. The senseless earth is dishonoured by the makers of images, who change it by their art from its proper nature, and induce men to worship it; and the makers of gods worship not gods and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but in my view earth and art, which go to make up images. For, in truth, the image is only dead matter shaped by the craftsman's hand. But <em>we</em> have no sensible image of sensible matter, but an image that is perceived by the mind alone&mdash;<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God. </p>

<p>And again, when involved in calamities, the superstitious worshippers of stones, though they have learned by the event that senseless matter is not to be worshipped, yet, yielding to the pressure of misfortune, become the victims of their <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; and though despising the images, yet not wishing to appear wholly to neglect them, are found fault with by those gods by whose names the images are called.</p>

<p>For Dionysius the tyrant, the younger, having stripped off the golden mantle from the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Jupiter in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, ordered him to be clothed in a woollen one, remarking facetiously that the latter was better than the golden one, being lighter in summer and warmer in winter. And Antiochus of <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a>, being in difficulties for money, ordered the golden <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Zeus, fifteen cubits in height, to be melted; and one like it, of less valuable material, plated with gold, to be erected in place of it. And the swallows and most birds fly to these <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, and void their excrement on them, paying no respect either to Olympian Zeus, or Epidaurian Asclepius, or even to Athene Polias, or the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Serapis; but not even from them have you learned the senselessness of images.  But it has happened that miscreants or enemies have assailed and set fire to temples, and plundered them of their votive gifts, and melted even the images themselves, from base greed of gain. And if a Cambyses or a Darius, or any other madman, has made such attempts, and if one has killed the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Apis, I laugh at him killing their god, while pained at the outrage being perpetrated for the sake of gain. I will therefore willingly forget such villany, looking on acts like these more as <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, than as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the impotence of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. But fire and earthquakes are shrewd enough not to feel shy or frightened at either <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> or <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, any more than at pebbles heaped by the waves on the shore.</p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> fire to be capable of exposing and curing <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. If you are willing to abandon this folly, the element of fire shall light your way. This same fire burned the temple in Argos, with Chrysis the priestess; and that of Artemis in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> the second time after the Amazons. And the Capitol in Rome was often wrapped in flames; nor did the fire spare the temple of Serapis, in the city of the Alexandrians. At Athens it demolished the temple of the Eleutherian Dionysus; and as to the temple of Apollo at Delphi, first a storm assailed it, and then the discerning fire utterly destroyed it. This is told as the preface of what the fire promises. And the makers of images, do they not shame those of you who are wise into despising matter? The Athenian Phidias inscribed on the finger of the Olympian Jove, Pantarkes  is beautiful. It was not Zeus that was beautiful in his eyes, but the man he loved. And Praxiteles, as Posidippus relates in his book about Cnidus, when he fashioned the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Aphrodite of Cnidus, made it like the form of Cratine, of whom he was enamoured, that the miserable people might have the paramour of Praxiteles to worship. And when Phryne the courtesan, the Thespian, was in her bloom, all the painters made their pictures of Aphrodite copies of the beauty of Phryne; as, again, the sculptors at Athens made their Mercuries like Alcibiades. It remains for you to judge whether you ought to worship courtesans. Moved, as I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, by such facts, and despising such fables, the ancient kings unblushingly proclaimed themselves gods, as this involved no danger from men, and thus taught that on account of their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> they were made <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Ceux, the son of Eolus, was styled Zeus by his wife Alcyone; Alcyone, again, being by her husband styled Hera. Ptolemy the Fourth was called Dionysus; and Mithridates of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> was also called Dionysus; and Alexander wished to be considered the son of Ammon, and to have his <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> made horned by the sculptors&mdash; eager to disgrace the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form by the addition of a horn. And not kings only, but private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> dignified themselves with the names of deities, as Menecrates the physician, who took the name of Zeus. What need is there for me to instance Alexarchus? He, having been by profession a grammarian, assumed the character of the sun-god, as Aristus of Salamis relates. And why mention Nicagorus? He was a native of Zela [in <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>], and lived in the days of Alexander. Nicagorus was styled Hermes, and used the dress of Hermes, as he himself testifies. And while whole nations, and cities with all their inhabitants, sinking into self-flattery, treat the myths about the gods with contempt, at the same time men themselves, assuming the air of equality with the gods, and being puffed up with vainglory, vote themselves extravagant honours. There is the case of the Macedonian Philip of Pella, the son of Amyntor, to whom they decreed divine worship in Cynosargus, although his collar-bone was broken, and he had a lame leg, and had one of his eyes knocked out. And again that of Demetrius, who was raised to the rank of the gods; and where he alighted from his horse on his entrance into Athens is the temple of Demetrius <em>the Alighter;</em> and altars were raised to him everywhere, and nuptials with Athene assigned to him by the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>. But he disdained the goddess, as he could not marry the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>; and taking the courtesan Lamia, he ascended the Acropolis, and lay with her on the couch of Athene, showing to the old virgin the postures of the young courtesan.</p>

<p>There is no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for indignation, then, at Hippo, who immortalized his own death. For this Hippo ordered the following elegy to be inscribed on his tomb:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>This is the sepulchre of Hippo, whom Destiny <br>Made, through death, equal to the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> gods.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Well done, Hippo! You show to us the delusion of men. If they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you speaking, now that you are dead, let them become your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. This is the oracle of Hippo; let us consider it. The objects of your worship were once men, and in process of time died; and fable and time have raised them to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. For somehow, what is present is wont to be despised through familiarity; but what is past, being separated through the obscurity of time from the temporary censure that attached to it, is invested with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by fiction, so that the present is viewed with distrust, the past with admiration. Exactly in this way is it, then, that the dead men of antiquity, being reverenced through the long prevalence of delusion respecting them, are regarded as gods by posterity. As grounds of your belief in these, there are your <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, your solemn assemblies, bonds and wounds, and weeping deities.</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Woe, woe! That <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> decrees my best-belov'd, <br>Sarpedon, by Patroclus' hand to fall.</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>The will of Zeus was overruled; and Zeus being worsted, laments for Sarpedon. With reason, therefore, have you yourselves called them shades and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, since Homer, paying Athene and the other divinities sinister <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, has styled them <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>She her heavenward course pursued <br>To join the immortals in the abode of Jove.</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>How, then, can shades and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> be still reckoned gods, being in reality unclean and impure spirits, acknowledged by all to be of an earthly and watery nature, sinking downwards by their own weight, and flitting about graves and tombs, about which they appear dimly, being but shadowy phantasms? Such things are your gods&mdash; shades and shadows; and to these add those maimed, wrinkled, squinting divinities the Lit&aelig;, daughters of Thersites rather than of Zeus. So that Bion&mdash; wittily, as I think&mdash; says, How in reason could men <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> Zeus for a beautiful progeny&mdash;a thing he could not obtain for himself?</p>

<p>The incorruptible being, as far as in you lies, you sink in the earth; and that pure and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> you have buried in the grave, robbing the divine of its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature.</p>

<p>Why, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, have you assigned the prerogatives of God to what are no gods? Why, let me ask, have you forsaken heaven to pay divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to earth? What else is gold, or silver, or steel, or iron, or brass, or ivory, or precious stones? Are they not earth, and of the earth?</p>

<p>Are not all these things which you look on the progeny of one mother&mdash; the earth?</p>

<p>Why, then, foolish and silly men (for I will repeat it), have you, defaming the supercelestial region, dragged religion to the ground, by fashioning to yourselves gods of earth, and by going after those created objects, instead of the uncreated Deity, have sunk into deepest darkness?</p>

<p>The Parian stone is beautiful, but it is not yet Poseidon. The ivory is beautiful, but it is not yet the Olympian Zeus. Matter always needs art to fashion it, but the deity needs nothing. Art has come forward to do its work, and the matter is clothed with its shape; and while the preciousness of the material makes it capable of being turned to profitable account, it is only on account of its form that it comes to be deemed worthy of veneration. Your image, if considered as to its origin, is gold, it is wood, it is stone, it is earth, which has received shape from the artist's hand. But I have been in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of walking on the earth, not of worshipping it. For I hold it wrong to entrust my spirit's hopes to things destitute of the breath of life. We must therefore approach as close as possible to the images. How peculiarly inherent deceit is in them, is manifest from their very look. For the forms of the images are plainly stamped with the characteristic nature of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. If one go round and inspect the pictures and images, he will at a glance recognise your gods from their shameful forms: Dionysus from his robe; Heph&aelig;stus from his art; Demeter from her calamity; Ino from her head-dress; Poseidon from his trident; Zeus from the swan; the pyre indicates Heracles; and if one sees a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of a naked <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> without an inscription, he understands it to be the golden Aphrodite. Thus that Cyprian Pygmalion became enamoured of an image of ivory: the image was Aphrodite, and it was nude. The Cyprian is made a conquest of by the mere shape, and embraces the image. This is related by Philostephanus. A different Aphrodite in Cnidus was of stone, and beautiful. Another person became enamoured of it, and shamefully embraced the stone. Posidippus relates this. The former of these authors, in his book on <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and the latter in his book on Cnidus. So powerful is art to delude, by seducing amorous men into the pit. Art is powerful, but it cannot deceive reason, nor those who live agreeably to reason. The doves on the picture were represented so to the life by the painter's art, that the pigeons flew to them; and horses have neighed to well-executed pictures of mares. They say that a girl became enamoured of an image, and a comely youth of the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> at Cnidus. But it was the eyes of the spectators that were deceived by art; for no one in his senses ever would have embraced a goddess, or entombed himself with a lifeless paramour, or become enamoured of a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> and a stone. But it is with a different kind of spell that art deludes you, if it leads you not to the indulgence of amorous affections: it leads you to pay religious <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and worship to images and pictures.</p>

<p>The picture is like. Well and good! Let art receive its meed of praise, but let it not deceive man by passing itself off for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The horse stands quiet; the dove flutters not, its wing is motionless. But the cow of D&aelig;dalus, made of wood, allured the savage bull; and art having deceived him, compelled him to meet a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> full of licentious passion. Such frenzy have mischief-working arts created in the minds of the insensate. On the other hand, apes are admired by those who feed and care for them, because nothing in the shape of images and girls' ornaments of wax or clay deceives them. You then will show yourselves inferior to apes by cleaving to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a>, and wood, and gold, and ivory images, and to pictures. Your makers of such mischievous toys&mdash; the sculptors and makers of images, the painters and workers in metal, and the poets&mdash; have introduced a motley crowd of divinities: in the fields, Satyrs and Pans; in the woods, Nymphs, and Oreads, and Hamadryads; and besides, in the waters, the rivers, and fountains, the Naiads; and in the sea the Nereids. And now the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> boast that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are the ministers of their impiety, reckoning them among the number of their domestics, and by their charms compelling them to be their slaves. Besides, the nuptials of the deities, their begetting and bringing forth of children that are recounted, their adulteries celebrated in song, their carousals represented in comedy, and bursts of laughter over their cups, which your authors introduce, urge me to cry out, though I would fain be silent. Oh the godlessness! You have turned heaven into a stage; the Divine has become a drama; and what is sacred you have acted in comedies under the masks of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, travestying <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion by your demon-worship [<a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>].</p>

<blockquote><p><q>But he, striking the lyre, began to sing beautifully.</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>Sing to us, Homer, that beautiful song</p>

<blockquote><p><q>About the amours of Ares and Venus with the beautiful crown: <br>How first they slept together in the palace of Heph&aelig;stus <br>Secretly; and he gave many gifts, and dishonoured the bed and chamber of king Heph&aelig;stus.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Stop, O Homer, the song! It is not beautiful; it teaches <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and we are prohibited from polluting our ears with hearing about <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> for we are they who bear about with us, in this living and moving image of our <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;a likeness which dwells with us, takes counsel with us, associates with us, is a guest with us, feels with us, feels for us. We have become a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> offering to God for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake: we are the chosen generation, the royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, the peculiar people, who once were not a people, but are now the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who, according to John, are not of those who are beneath, but have learned all from Him who came from above; who have come to understand the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who have learned to walk in newness of life. But these are not the sentiments of the many; but, casting off shame and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, they depict in their houses the unnatural <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Accordingly, wedded to impurity, they adorn their bed-chambers with painted tablets  hung up in them, regarding licentiousness as religion; and lying in bed, in the midst of their embraces, they look on that Aphrodite locked in the embrace of her paramour. And in the hoops of their rings they cut a representation of the amorous bird that fluttered round Leda,&mdash; having a strong predilection for representations of effeminacy&mdash;and use a seal stamped with an impression of the licentiousness of Zeus. Such are examples of your voluptuousness, such are the theologies of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, such are the instructions of your gods, who commit fornication along with you; for what one wishes, that he thinks, according to the Athenian orator. And of what kind, on the other hand, are your other images? Diminutive Pans, and naked girls, and drunken Satyrs, and phallic tokens, painted naked in pictures disgraceful for filthiness. And more than this: you are not ashamed in the eyes of all to look at representations of all forms of licentiousness which are portrayed in public places, but set them up and guard them with scrupulous care, consecrating these pillars of shamelessness at home, as if, forsooth, they were the images of your gods, depicting on them equally the postures of Phil&aelig;nis and the labours of Heracles. Not only the use of these, but the sight of them, and the very hearing of them, we denounce as deserving the doom of oblivion. Your ears are debauched, your eyes commit fornication, your looks commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> before you embrace. O you that have done <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and have devoted to shame what is divine in this handiwork of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you disbelieve everything that you may indulge your <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and that you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, because you have a craving after their licentiousness, but disbelieve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because you cannot bear a life of self-restraint. You have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> what was better, and valued what was worse, having been spectators indeed of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but actors of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Happy, therefore, so to say, alone are all those with one accord&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Who shall refuse to look on any temples <br>And altars, worthless seats of dumb stones, <br>And <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of stone, and images made by hands, <br>Stained with the life's-blood, and with <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <br>Of quadrupeds, and bipeds, and fowls, and butcheries of wild beasts.</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>For we are expressly prohibited from exercising a deceptive art: <q>For you shall not make,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>the likeness of anything which is in heaven above or in the earth beneath.</q> </p>

<p>For can we possibly any longer suppose the Demeter, and the Core, and the mystic Iacchus of Praxiteles, to be gods, and not rather regard the art of Leucippus, or the hands of <a href="../cathen/01593a.htm">Apelles</a>, which clothed the material with the form of the divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as having a better title to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>? But while you bestow the greatest pains that the image may be fashioned with the most exquisite beauty possible, you exercise no care to guard against your becoming like images for stupidity. Accordingly, with the utmost clearness and brevity, the prophetic word condemns this practice: <q>For all the gods of the nations are the images of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; but God made the heavens, and what is in heaven.</q>  Some, however, who have fallen into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how, worship God's work instead of God Himself&mdash;the sun and the moon, and the rest of the starry <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>&mdash;absurdly imagining these, which are but instruments for measuring time, to be gods; <q>for by His word they were established, and all their host by the breath of His mouth.</q> </p>

<p>Human art, moreover, produces houses, and ships, and cities, and pictures. But how shall I tell what God makes? Behold the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; it is His work: and the heaven, and the sun, and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and men, are the works of His fingers.  How great is the power of God! His bare volition was the creation of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. For God alone made it, because He alone is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God. By the bare exercise of volition He creates; His mere willing was followed by the springing into being of what He willed. Consequently the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, who indeed most nobly confess that man was made for the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the heavens, but who worship the objects that appear in the heavens and are apprehended by sight. For if the heavenly bodies are not the works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they were certainly created for man. Let none of you worship the sun, but set his desires on the Maker of the sun; nor deify the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, but seek after the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. The only refuge, then, which remains for him who would reach the portals of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is divine wisdom. From this, as from a sacred asylum, the man who presses after <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, can be dragged by no <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>.</p>
