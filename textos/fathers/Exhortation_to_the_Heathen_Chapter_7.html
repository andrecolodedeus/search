<h1>Exhortation to the Heathen (Chapter 7)</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA</em></strong>

<h2>Chapter 7. The Poets Also Bear Testimony to the Truth.</h2>

<p>Let poetry also approach to us (for <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> alone will not suffice): poetry which is wholly occupied with <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>&mdash; which scarcely will make confession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but will rather own to God its deviations into fable. Let whoever of those poets chooses advance first. Aratus considers that the power of God pervades all things:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>That all may be secure, <br>Him ever they propitiate first and last, <br>Hail, Father I great marvel, great gain to man.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Thus also the Ascr&aelig;an Hesiod dimly speaks of God:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>For He is the King of all, and monarch <br>Of the immortals; and there is none that may vie <br>with Him in power.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Also on the stage they reveal the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Look on the ether and heaven, and regard that as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>

</p></blockquote><p>says Euripides. And Sophocles, the son of Sophilus, says:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>One, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, one is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <br>Who made both heaven and the far-stretching earth, <br>And ocean's blue wave, and the mighty winds; <br>But many of us mortals, deceived in heart, <br>Have set up for ourselves, as a consolation in our afflictions, <br>Images of the gods of stone, or wood, or brass, <br>Or gold, or ivory; <br>And, appointing to those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and vain festal assemblages, <br>Are accustomed thus to practice religion.</q></p></blockquote> 

<p>In this venturous manner has he on the stage brought <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> before the spectators. But the Thracian Orpheus, the son of &OElig;agrus, hierophant and poet at once, after his exposition of the orgies, and his theology of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, introduces a palinode of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, though tardily singing the strain:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>I shall utter to whom it is lawful; but let the doors be closed, <br>Nevertheless, against all the profane. But do you hear, <br>O Mus&aelig;us, offspring of the light-bringing moon, <br>For I will declare what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And let not these things <br>Which once appeared in your breast rob you of dear life; <br>But looking to the divine word, apply yourself to it, <br>Keeping right <em>the seat of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and feeling;</em> and walk well <br>In the straight path, and to the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> King of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> alone <br>Direct your gaze.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Then proceeding, he clearly adds:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>He is one, self-proceeding; and from Him alone all things proceed, <br>And in them He Himself exerts his activity: no mortal <br>Beholds Him, but He beholds all.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Thus far Orpheus at last understood that he had been in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>But linger no longer, O man, endued with varied wisdom; <br>But turn and retrace your steps, and propitiate God.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>For if, at the most, the Greeks, having received certain scintillations of the divine word, have given forth some utterances of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they bear indeed <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not hidden, and at the same time expose their own weakness in not having arrived at the end. For I think it has now become evident to all, that those who do or speak anything without the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are like people compelled to walk without feet. Let the strictures on your gods, which the poets, impelled by the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, introduce in their comedies, shame you into <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Menander, for instance, the comic poet, in his drama of the <em>Charioteer</em>, says:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>No God pleases me that goes about <br>With an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and enters houses <br>Carrying a trencher.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>For such are the begging <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Cybele. Hence Antisthenes replies appropriately to their request for <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>I do not maintain the mother of the gods, <br>For the gods maintain her.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>Again, the same writer of comedy, expressing his dissatisfaction with the common usages, tries to expose the impious arrogance of the prevailing <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the drama of the <em>Priestess</em>, sagely declaring:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>If a man drags the Deity <br>Whither he will by the sound of cymbals, <br>He that does this is greater than the Deity; <br>But these are the instruments of audacity and means of living <br>Invented by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q>

</p></blockquote><p>And not only Menander, but Homer also, and Euripides, and other poets in great numbers, expose your gods, and are wont to rate them, and that soundly too. For instance, they call Aphrodite dog-fly, and Heph&aelig;stus a cripple. Helen says to Aphrodite:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>Your godship abdicate! <br>Renounce Olympus!</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>And of Dionysus, Homer writes without reserve:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>He, mid their frantic orgies, in the groves <br>Of lovely Nyssa, put to shameful rout <br>The youthful Bacchus' nurses; they in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <br>Dropped each her thyrsus, scattered by the hand <br>Of fierce Lycurgus, with an ox-goad armed.</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>Worthy <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> of the Socratic school is Euripides, who fixes his eye on <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and despises the spectators of his plays. On one occasion, Apollo,</p>

<blockquote><p><q>Who inhabits the sanctuary that is in the middle of the earth, <br>Dispensing most certain oracles to mortals,</q>

</p></blockquote><p>is thus exposed:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>It was in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to him that I killed her who brought me forth; <br>Him do you regard as stained with guilt&mdash; put him to death; <br>It was he that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, not I, uninstructed as I was <br>In right and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>.</q> 

</p></blockquote><p>He introduces Heracles, at one time mad, at another drunk and gluttonous. How should he not so represent the god who, when entertained as a guest, ate green figs to flesh, uttering discordant howls, that even his barbarian host remarked it? In his drama of <em>Ion</em>, too, he barefacedly brings the gods on the stage:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p><q>How, then, is it right for you, who have given <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to mortals, <br>To be yourselves guilty of wrong? <br>And if&mdash; what will never take place, yet I will state the supposition&mdash; <br>You will give satisfaction to men for your adulteries, <br>You, Poseidon, and you, Zeus, the ruler of heaven,&mdash; <br>You will, in order to make recompense for your misdeeds, <br>Have to empty your temples.</q> 
</p></blockquote>
