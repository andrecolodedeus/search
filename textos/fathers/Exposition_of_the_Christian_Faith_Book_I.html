<h1>Exposition of the Christian Faith, Book I</h1>

<h2>Exposition of the ChristianFaith.</h2>

<h3>Preface.</h3>

<p>On the eve of setting out for the East, to aid his uncle Valens in repelling a Gothic invasion, Gratian, the Emperor of the West, requested St. Ambrose to write him a treatise in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Gratian's object in making this request was to secure some sort of preservative against the corrupting influence of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arianism</a>, which at that time (a.d. 378) had gained the upper hand of Orthodoxy in the Eastern provinces of the Empire, owing to its establishment at the Imperial Court. In compliance with Gratian's wish, the Bishop of Milan composed a treatise, which now forms the first two Books of the <em>De Fide.</em> With this work the Emperor was so much pleased that on his return from the East, after the death of Valens at <a href="../cathen/01161a.htm">Hadrianople</a>, he wrote to St. Ambrose, begging for a fresh copy of the treatise, and further, for its enlargement by the addition of a discourse on the Divinity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. The original treatise was, indeed, enlarged by St. Ambrose in 379, but the additional Books dealt, not with the Divinity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but rather with new objections raised by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> teachers, and points which had either been passed over or not fully discussed already. In this way St. Ambrose's Exposition was brought into its present form.</p>

<p>The object of the Exposition is, as has already been indicated, to prove the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and His co-eternity, co-equality, and consubstantiality, as God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. This the author does by constant appeal to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, both of the Old and of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> had in many cases forced into the mould of false interpretation to make them fit their doctrine.</p>

<p>Besides the title of <em>De Fide</em>, that of <em>De Trinitate</em> was one by which this treatise was largely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in after ages; it is certain, though, that the former was that assigned by St. Ambrose himself.</p>

<h3>Prefatory Note.</h3>

<p>The notes to the first four books of the <em>De Fide</em> have in some instances been taken over from those in Father Hurter's Edition of the treatise (Innsbruck: Wagner), which has been used in preparing the translation of these books. These notes are distinguished by the letter "H." placed at the end.</p>

<p>The citations from Scripture embodied in the text have been translated as they stood in the original. This will account for any divergence from the renderings in the English <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> and Prayer-book, while any agreement may be set down to reminiscences of the more familiar versions. It was thought best to adopt this treatment of St. Ambrose's citations, inasmuch as the divergences are worth noticing, and indeed, in some cases, the argument rather turns upon them. The references are, throughout, made to chapters and verses in the English <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a>, and not to the Vulgate, unless especially stated so to be.</p>

<p>The Prefaces and Summaries of Contents are based on those in Father Hurter's Edition.</p>

<h3>St. Ambrose's Exposition of the Christian Faith.</h3> <hr style="text-align: center; width: 15%;">
<h3>Book I.</h3>

<h4>Prologue.</h4>

<p><strong>The author praises Gratian's zeal for instruction in the Faith, and speaks lowly of his own merits. Taught of God Himself, the Emperor stands in no need of human instruction; yet this his devoutness prepares the way to victory. The task appointed to the author is difficult: in the accomplishment whereof he will be guided not so much by reason and argument as by authority, especially that of the Nicene Council.</strong></p>

<p>1. The Queen of the South, as we read in the Book of the Kings, came to hear the wisdom of Solomon. <span class="stiki" id="note341661"><a href="../bible/1ki010.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;10:1</a></span> Likewise King Hiram sent to Solomon that he might prove him. <span class="stiki" id="note341662"><a href="../bible/1ki005.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;5:1</a></span> So also your sacred Majesty, following these examples of old time, has decreed to hear my confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But I am no Solomon, that you should wonder at my wisdom, and your Majesty is not the sovereign of a single people; it is the Augustus, ruler of the whole world, that has commanded the setting forth of the Faith in a book, not for your instruction, but for your approval.</p>

<p>2. For why, august Emperor, should your Majesty learn that Faith which, from your earliest childhood, you have ever devoutly and lovingly kept? <q>Before I formed you in your mother's belly I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>and before you came forth out of the womb I sanctified you.</q>  Sanctification, therefore, comes not of tradition, but of inspiration; therefore keep watch over the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For that which no man has taught you, God has surely given and inspired.</p>

<p>3. Your sacred Majesty, being about to go forth to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, requires of me a book, expounding the Faith, since your Majesty <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that victories are gained more by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the commander, than by valour in the soldiers. For <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> led into battle three hundred and eighteen men,  and brought home the spoils of countless foes; and having, by the power of that which was the sign of our Lord's Cross and Name,  overcome the might of five kings and conquering hosts, he both avenged his neighbour and gained victory and the ransom of his brother's son. So also Joshua the son of Nun, when he could not prevail against the enemy with the might of all his army, <span class="stiki" id="note341666"><a href="../bible/jos006.htm#verse6">Joshua&nbsp;6:6</a></span> overcame by sound of seven sacred trumpets, in the place where he saw and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the Captain of the heavenly host.  For victory, then, your Majesty makes ready, being Christ's loyal servant and defender of the Faith, which you would have me set forth in writing.</p>

<p>4. Truly, I would rather take upon me the duty of exhortation to keep the Faith, than that of disputing thereon; for the former means devout confession, whereas the latter is liable to rash presumption. Howbeit, forasmuch as your Majesty has no need of exhortation, while I may not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to be excused from the duty of loyalty, I will take in hand a bold enterprise, yet modestly withal, not so much reasoning and disputing concerning the Faith as gathering together a multitude of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. </p>

<p>5. Of the Acts of Councils, I shall let that one be my chief guide which three hundred and eighteen <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, appointed, as it were, after the judgment of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,  made (so to speak) a trophy raised to proclaim their victory over the <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a> throughout the world, prevailing by that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of the Faith, wherein all agreed. Verily, as it seems to me, one may herein see the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, forasmuch as the same number is our authority in the Councils of the Faith, and an example of loyalty in the records of old.</p>

<h4>Chapter 1.</h4>

<p><strong> <em>The author distinguishes the faith from the errors of Pagans,</em>  <em>Jews, and Heretics, and after explaining the significance of the names <q>God</q> and <q>Lord,</q> shows clearly the difference of Persons in Unity of Essence.</em>  <em> In dividing the Essence, the Arians not only bring in the doctrine of three Gods, but even overthrow the dominion of the Trinity.</em></strong></p>

<p>6. Now this is the declaration of our Faith, that we say that God is One, neither dividing His Son from Him, as do the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>,  nor denying, with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that He was begotten of the Father before all worlds,  and afterwards born of the Virgin; nor yet, like Sabellius,  confounding the Father with the Word, and so maintaining that Father and Son are one and the same Person; nor again, as does Photinus,  holding that the Son first came into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the Virgin's womb: nor believing, with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>,  in a number of diverse Powers,  and so, like the benighted <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, making out more than one God. For it is written: <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: the Lord your God is one God.</q> </p>

<p>7. For God and Lord is a name of majesty, a name of power, even as God Himself says: <q>The Lord is My name,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341679"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse15">Exodus&nbsp;3:15</a></span> and as in another place the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> declares: <q>The Lord Almighty is His name.</q>  God is He, therefore, and Lord, either because His rule is over all, or because He beholds all things, and is feared by all, without difference. </p>

<p>8. If, then, God is One, one is the name, one is the power, of the Trinity. Christ Himself, indeed, says: <q>Go, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the nations in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341682"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> In the <em>name</em>, mark you, not in the <em>names.</em> </p>

<p>9. Moreover, Christ Himself says: <q>I and the Father are One.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341684"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> <q>One,</q> said He, that there be no separation of power and nature; but again, <q> <em>We are</em>,</q> that you may recognize Father and Son, forasmuch as the perfect Father is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have begotten the perfect Son, <span class="stiki" id="note341685"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse48">Matthew&nbsp;5:48</a></span> and the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are One, not by confusion of Person, but by unity of nature. </p>

<p>10. We say, then, that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, not two or three Gods, this being the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> into which the impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> does run with its <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>. For it says that there are three Gods, in that it divides the Godhead of the Trinity; whereas the Lord, in saying, <q>Go, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,</q> has shown that the Trinity is of one power. We confess Father, Son, and Spirit, understanding in a perfect Trinity both fullness of Divinity and unity of power. </p>

<p>11. <q>Every kingdom divided against itself shall quickly be overthrown,</q> says the Lord. Now the kingdom of the Trinity is not divided. If, therefore, it is not divided, it is one; for that which is not one is divided. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, however, would have the kingdom of the Trinity to be such as may easily be overthrown, by division against itself. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, seeing that it cannot be overthrown, it is plainly undivided. For no unity is divided or rent asunder, and therefore neither age nor corruption has any power over it. </p>

<h4>Chapter 2.</h4>

<p><strong>The Emperor is exhorted to display zeal in the Faith. Christ's perfect Godhead is shown from the unity of will and working which He has with the Father. The attributes of Divinity are shown to be proper to Christ, Whose various titles prove His essential unity, with distinction of Person. In no other way can the unity of God be maintained.</strong></p>

<p>12. <q>Not every one that says unto Me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341689"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;7:21</a></span> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>. Faith, therefore, august Sovereign, must not be a mere matter of performance, for it is written, <q>The <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of your house has devoured me.</q>  Let us then with faithful spirit and devout mind call upon Jesus our Lord, let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the end that whatever we ask of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, we may obtain in His name.  For the Father's will is, that He be entreated through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Son's that the Father be entreated. </p>

<p>13. The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His submission makes for agreement [with our teaching], and the acts of His power are not at variance therewith. For whatsoever things the Father does, the same also does the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in like manner.  The Son both does the same things, and does them in like manner, but it is the Father's will that He be entreated in the matter of what He Himself proposes to do, that you may understand, not that He cannot do it otherwise, but that there is one power displayed. Truly, then, is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be adored and worshipped, Who by the power of His Godhead has laid the foundations of the world, and by His submission informed our affections. </p>

<p>14. Therefore we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, perfect, almighty, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, such as we find Him in the Law and the Prophets, and the rest of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>,  for otherwise there is no God. For He Who is God cannot but be good, seeing that fullness of goodness is of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God:  nor can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who made time, be in time; nor, again, can God be imperfect, for a lesser being is plainly imperfect, seeing that it lacks somewhat whereby it could be made equal to a greater. This, then, is the teaching of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; that God is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that with God nothing is impossible, that God exists not in time, that God is beneath no being. If I am in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, let my adversaries prove it. </p>

<p>15. Seeing, then, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is, by consequence, good and almighty and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and perfect and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for these attributes belong to the essential nature of the Godhead. Let our adversaries, therefore, deny the Divine Nature in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash;otherwise they cannot refuse to God what is proper to the Divine Nature.</p>

<p>16. Further, that none may fall into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, let a man attend to those signs vouchsafed us by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, whereby we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Son. He is called the Word, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  The Word, because He is without blemish; the Power, because He is perfect; the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He is begotten of the Father; the Wisdom, because He is one with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, one in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, one in Divinity. Not that the Father is one Person with the Son; between Father and Son is the plain distinction that comes of generation;  so that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Everlasting of Everlasting, Fulness of Fulness. </p>

<p>17. Now these are not mere names, but signs of power manifesting itself in works, for while there is fullness of Godhead in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, there is also fullness of Godhead in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not diverse, but one. The Godhead is nothing confused, for it is an unity: nothing manifold, for in it there is no difference.</p>

<p>18. Moreover, if in all them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> there was, as it is written, one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and one heart: <span class="stiki" id="note341701"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32</a></span> if every one that cleaves to the Lord is one spirit, <span class="stiki" id="note341702"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> as the Apostle has said: if a man and his wife are one flesh:  if all we mortal men are, so far as regards our general nature, of one substance: if this is what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says of created men, that, being many, they are one,  who can in no way be compared to Divine Persons, how much more are the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> one in Divinity, with Whom there is no difference either of substance or of will!</p>

<p>19. For how else shall we say that God is One? Divinity makes plurality, but unity of power debars quantity of number, seeing that unity is not number, but itself is the principle of all numbers.</p>

<h4>Chapter 3.</h4>

<p><strong>By evidence gathered from Scripture the unity of Father and Son is proved, and firstly, a passage, taken from the Book of Isaiah, is compared with others and expounded in such sort as to show that in the Son there is no diversity from the Father's nature, save only as regards the flesh; whence it follows that the Godhead of both Persons is One. This conclusion is confirmed by the authority of Baruch.</strong></p>

<p>20. Now the oracles  of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> what close unity <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture declares to subsist between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> as regards their Godhead. For thus says the Lord of Sabaoth:  <q><a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> has laboured, and the commerce of the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> and Sabeans: mighty men shall come over to you, and shall be your servants, and in your train shall they follow, bound in fetters, and they shall fall down before you, and to you shall they make supplication: for God is in you, and there is no God beside you. For you are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, O God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> </p>

<p>21. Hear the voice of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>In You,</q> he says, <q>is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is no God beside You.</q> How agrees this with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians'</a> teaching? They must deny either the Father's or the Son's Divinity, unless they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, once for all, unity of the same Divinity.</p>

<p>22. <q>In You,</q> says he, <q>is God</q>&mdash; forasmuch as the Father is in the Son. For it is written, <q>The Father, Who abides in Me, Himself speaks,</q> and <q>The works that I do, He Himself also does.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341708"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;14:10</a></span> And yet again we read that the Son is in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying, <q>I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341709"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;14:10</a></span> Let the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, if they can, make away with this kinship  in nature and unity in work.</p>

<p>23. There is, therefore, God in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not two Gods; for it is written that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>,  and there is Lord in Lord,  but not two Lords, forasmuch as it is likewise written: <q>Serve not two lords.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341713"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> And the Law says: <q>Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>! The Lord your God is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341714"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a></span> moreover, in the same Testament it is written: <q>The Lord rained from the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341715"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;19:24</a></span> The Lord, it is said, sent rain <q>from the Lord.</q> So also you may read in Genesis: <q>And God said&mdash;and God made,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341716"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;1:6-7</a></span> and, lower down, <q>And God made man in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341717"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26-27</a></span> yet it was not two gods, but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that made [man]. In the one place, then, as in the other, the unity of operation and of name is maintained. For surely, when we read <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  we do not speak of two Gods.</p>

<p>24. Again, you may read in the forty-fourth psalm  how the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> not only calls the Father <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></q> but also proclaims the Son as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: <q>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever.</q>  And further on: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has anointed you with the oil of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> above your fellows.</q>  This God Who anoints, and God Who in the flesh is anointed, is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. For what fellows in His anointing has Christ, except such as are in the flesh? You see, then, that God is by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> anointed, but being anointed in taking upon Him the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, He is proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; yet is the principle of the Law not broken.</p>

<p>25. So again, when you read, <q>The Lord rained from the Lord,</q> acknowledge the unity of Godhead, for unity in operation does not allow of more than one individual <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even as the Lord Himself has shown, saying: <q>Believe Me, that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me: or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me for the very works' sake.</q>  Here, too, we see that unity of Godhead is signified by unity in operation.</p>

<p>26. The Apostle, careful to prove that there is one Godhead of both Father and Son, and one Lordship, lest we should run into any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, whether of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> or of Jewish ungodliness, showed us the rule we ought to follow, saying: <q>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from Whom are all things, and we in Him, and one Lord, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, by Whom are all things, and we by Him.</q>  For just as, in calling <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> <q>Lord,</q> he did not deny that the Father was Lord, even so, in saying, <q>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> he did not deny <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and thus he taught, not that there was more than one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that the source of power was one, forasmuch as Godhead consists in Lordship, and Lordship in Godhead, as it is written: <q>Be sure that the Lord, He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is He that has made us, and not we ourselves.</q> </p>

<p>27. <q>In you,</q> therefore, <q>is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> by unity of nature, and <q>there is no God beside You,</q> by reason of personal possession of the Substance, without any reserve or difference. </p>

<p>28. Again, Scripture speaks, in the Book of Jeremiah, of One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet acknowledges both Father and Son. Thus we read: <q>He is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in comparison with Him none other shall be accounted of. He has discovered all the way of teaching, and given it to Jacob, His servant, and to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, His beloved. After these things He appeared upon earth, and conversed with men.</q></p>

<p>29. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speaks of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for it was the Son Himself Who conversed with men, and this is what he says: <q>He is our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in comparison with Him none other shall be accounted of.</q> Why do we call Him in question, of Whom so great a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says that no other can be compared with Him? What comparison of another <em>can</em> be made, when the Godhead is One? This was the confession of a people set in the midst of dangers; reverencing religion, and therefore unskilled in strife of argument.</p>

<p>30. Come, <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and help Your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, in whom You are wont to dwell, in whom we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Shall we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the wise of this world, if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? But where is the wise man, where is the scribe? When our peasant planted figs, he found that whereof the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing, for God has chosen the foolish things of this world to confound the strong.  Are we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? For God was once <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Jewry. Nay, but they deny that very thing, which is the foundation of our belief, seeing that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who have denied the Son. </p>

<h4>Chapter 4.</h4>

<p><strong>The Unity of God is necessarily implied in the order of Nature, in the Faith, and in Baptism. The gifts of the Magi declare (1) the Unity of the Godhead; (2) Christ's Godhead and Manhood. The truth of the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity is shown in the Angel walking in the midst of the furnace with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</strong></p>

<p>31. All nature testifies to the Unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is one. The Faith declares that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, seeing that there is one belief in both the Old and the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. That there is one Spirit, all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,  <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> witnesses, because there is one Baptism, in the Name of the Trinity. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> proclaim, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> hear, the voice of one God. In one God did the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and they brought, in adoration, gold, frankincense, and myrrh to Christ's cradle, confessing, by the gift of gold, His Royalty, and with the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> worshipping Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For gold is the sign of kingdom, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, myrrh of burial. </p>

<p>32. What, then, was the meaning of the mystic offerings in the lowly cattle-stalls, save that we should discern in Christ the difference between the Godhead and the flesh? He is seen as man, <span class="stiki" id="note341730"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> He is adored as Lord. He lies in swaddling-clothes, but shines amid the stars; the cradle shows His birth, the stars His dominion;  it is the flesh that is wrapped in clothes, the Godhead that receives the ministry of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Thus the dignity of His natural majesty is not lost, and His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> assumption of the flesh is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.</p>

<p>33. This is our Faith. Thus did God will that He should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by all, thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the three children, <span class="stiki" id="note341732"><a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse17">Daniel&nbsp;4:17</a></span> and felt not the fire into the midst whereof they were cast, which destroyed and burnt up unbelievers, <span class="stiki" id="note341733"><a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse22">Daniel&nbsp;4:22</a></span> while it fell harmless as dew upon the faithful, <span class="stiki" id="note341734"><a href="../bible/hos014.htm#verse5">Hosea&nbsp;14:5</a></span> for whom the flames kindled by others became cold, seeing that the torment had <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> lost its power in conflict with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For with them there was One in the form of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note341735"><a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse28">Daniel&nbsp;4:28</a></span> comforting them, <span class="stiki" id="note341736"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;22:43</a></span> to the end that in the number of the Trinity one Supreme Power might be praised. God was praised, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was seen in God's <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> spoke in the children. </p>

<h4>Chapter 5.</h4>

<p><strong> <em>The various blasphemies uttered by the Arians against Christ are cited. Before these are replied to, the orthodox</em>  <em>are admonished to beware of the captious arguments of philosophers, forasmuch as in these especially did the heretics put their trust.</em></strong></p>

<p>34. Now let us consider the disputings of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>35. They say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is unlike His Father. To say this of a man would be an insult. </p>

<p>36. They say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> had a beginning in time,  whereas He Himself is the source and ordainer of time and all that therein is.  We are men, and we would not be limited to time. We began to exist once, and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we shall have a timeless <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. We desire after <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>&mdash; how, then, can we deny the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of God's Son, Whom God declares to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> by nature, not by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?</p>

<p>37. They say that He was created.  But who would reckon an author with his works, and have him seem to be what he has himself made?</p>

<p>38. They deny His goodness.  Their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> is its own condemnation, and so cannot hope for pardon.</p>

<p>39. They deny that He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, they deny His omnipotence, in that while they admit that all things are made by the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, they attribute the original source of their being to the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But what is power, save perfection of nature? </p>

<p>40. Furthermore, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> deny that in Godhead He is One with the Father.  Let them annul the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, then, and silence the voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For Christ Himself has said: <q>I and the Father are one.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341746"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> It is not I who say this: Christ has said it. Is He a deceiver, that He should lie? <span class="stiki" id="note341747"><a href="../bible/num023.htm#verse19">Numbers&nbsp;23:19</a></span> Is He unrighteous, that He should claim to be what He never was? But of these matters we will deal severally, at greater length, in their proper place.</p>

<p>41. Seeing, then, that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is unlike His Father, and seeks to maintain this by force of subtle disputation, we must cite the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>: <q>Take heed that no man make spoil of you by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain deceit, according to the tradition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and after the rudiments of this world, not according to Christ; for in Him dwells all the fullness of Godhead in bodily shape.</q> </p>

<p>42. For they store up all the strength of their poisons in dialetical disputation, which by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> is defined as having no power to establish anything, and aiming only at destruction.  But it was not by dialectic that it pleased God to save His people; <q>for the kingdom of God consists in simplicity of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not in wordy contention.</q> </p>

<h4>Chapter 6.</h4>

<p><strong>By way of leading up to his proof that Christ is not different from the Father, St. Ambrose cites the more famous leaders of the Arian party, and explains how little their witness agrees, and shows what defence the Scriptures provide against them.</strong></p>

<p>43. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, then, say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is unlike the Father; we deny it. Nay, indeed, we shrink in dread from the word. Nevertheless I would not that your sacred Majesty should trust to argument and our disputation. Let us enquire of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In a word, let us enquire of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Whose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> these men say they uphold, if the Son be judged inferior to Him. But insult to the Son brings no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the good Father. It cannot please the good Father, if the Son be judged inferior, rather than equal, to His Father.</p>

<p>44. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> your sacred Majesty to suffer me, if for a little while I address myself particularly to these men. But whom shall I choose out to cite? Eunomius?  or <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and A&euml;tius,  his instructors? For there are many names, but one unbelief, constant in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but in conversation divided against itself; without difference in respect of deceit, but in common enterprise breeding dissent. But wherefore they will not agree together I understand not.</p>

<p>45. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> reject the person of Eunomius, but they maintain his unbelief and walk in the ways of his iniquity. They say that he has too generously published the writings of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. Truly, a plentiful lavishing of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>! They praise him who gave the command, and deny him who executed it! Wherefore they have now fallen apart into several <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. Some follow after Eunomius or A&euml;tius, others after Palladius or Demophilus and Auxentius, or the inheritors of this form of unbelief.  Others, again, follow different teachers. Is Christ, then, divided? <span class="stiki" id="note341754"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> Nay; but those who divide Him from the Father do with their own hands cut themselves asunder.</p>

<p>46. Seeing, therefore, that men who agree not among themselves have all alike conspired against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, I shall call those whom I have to answer by the common name of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, like some hydra of fable, has waxed great from its wounds, and, being ofttimes lopped short, has grown afresh, being appointed to find meet destruction in flames of fire.  Or, like some dread and monstrous Scylla, divided into many shapes of unbelief, she displays, as a mask to her guile, the pretence of being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, but those wretched men whom she finds tossed to and fro in the waves of her unhallowed strait, amid the wreckage of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, she, girt with beastly monsters, rends with the cruel fang of her <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> doctrine. </p>

<p>47. This monster's cavern, your sacred Majesty, thick laid, as seafaring men do say it is, with hidden lairs, and all the neighbourhood thereof, where the rocks of unbelief echo to the howling of her black dogs, we must pass by with ears in a manner stopped. For it is written: <q>Hedge your ears about with thorns;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341757"><a href="../bible/sir028.htm#verse28">Sirach&nbsp;28:28</a></span> and again: <q>Beware of dogs, beware of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> workers;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341758"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse2">Philippians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> and yet again: <q>A man that is an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, avoid after the first reproof, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that such an one is fallen, and is in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, being condemned of his own judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341759"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus&nbsp;3:10-11</a></span> So then, like <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> pilots, let us set the sails of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> for the course wherein we may pass by most safely, and again follow the coasts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. </p>

<h4>Chapter 7.</h4>

<p><strong>The likeness of Christ to the Father is asserted on the authority of St. Paul, the prophets, and the Gospel, and especially in reliance upon the creation of man in God's image.</strong></p>

<p>48. The Apostle says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the image of the Father&mdash; for he calls Him the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the first-begotten of all creation. First-begotten, mark you, not first-created, in order that He may be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be both begotten, in virtue of His nature,  and first in virtue of His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. In another place also the Apostle has declared that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the Son <q>heir of all things, by Whom also He made the worlds, Who is the brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the express image of His substance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341762"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse2">Hebrews&nbsp;1:2</a></span> The Apostle calls Christ the image of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> says that He is unlike the Father. Why, then, is He called an image, if He has no likeness? Men will not have their portraits unlike them, and <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> contends that the Father is unlike the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and would have it that the Father has begotten one unlike Himself, as though unable to generate His like.</p>

<p>49. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> say: <q>In Your light we shall see light;</q>  and again: <q>Wisdom is the brightness of everlasting light, and the spotless mirror of God's majesty, the image of His goodness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341764"><a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse26">Wisdom&nbsp;7:26</a></span> See what great names are declared! <q>Brightness,</q> because in the Son the Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shines clearly: <q>spotless mirror,</q> because the Father is seen in the Son: <span class="stiki" id="note341765"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse45">John&nbsp;12:45</a></span> <q>image of goodness,</q> because it is not one body seen reflected in another, but the whole power [of the Godhead] in the Son. The word <q>image</q> teaches us that there is no difference; <q>expression,</q> that He is the counterpart of the Father's form; and <q>brightness</q> declares His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.  The <q>image</q> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not that of a bodily countenance, not one made up of colours, nor modelled in wax, but simply derived from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, coming out from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, drawn from the fountainhead.</p>

<p>50. By means of this image the Lord showed Philip the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying, <q>Philip, he that sees Me, sees the Father also. How then do you say, Show us the Father? Do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341767"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;14:9-10</a></span> Yes, he who looks upon the Son sees, in portrait, the Father.  Mark what manner of portrait is spoken of. It is Truth, Righteousness, the Power of God:  not dumb, for it is the Word; not insensible, for it is Wisdom; not vain and foolish, for it is Power; not soulless, for it is the Life; not dead, for it is the Resurrection.  You see, then, that while an image is spoken of, the meaning is that it is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Whose image the Son is, seeing that no one can be his own image.</p>

<p>51. More might I set down from the Son's testimony; howbeit, lest He perchance appear to have asserted Himself overmuch, let us enquire of the Father. For the Father said, <q>Let us <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">make</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in Our image and likeness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341771"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> The Father says to the Son <q>in <em>Our</em> image and likeness,</q> and you say that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is unlike the Father.</p>

<p>52. John says, <q>Beloved, we are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that if He be revealed, we shall be like Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341772"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> O blind <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>! O shameless obstinacy! We are men, and, so far as we may, we shall be in the likeness of God: dare we deny that the Son is like God?</p>

<p>53. Therefore the Father has said: <q>Let us <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">make</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in Our image and likeness.</q> At the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> itself, as I read, the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, and I see one creation. I hear Him that speaks.  I acknowledge Him that does:  but it is of one image, one likeness, that I read. This likeness belongs not to diversity but to unity. What, therefore, you claim for yourself, you take from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, seeing, indeed, that you can not be in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save by help of the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h4>Chapter 8.</h4>

<p><strong>The likeness of the Son to the Father being proved, it is not hard to prove the Son's eternity, though, indeed, this may be established on the authority of the Prophet Isaiah and St. John the Evangelist, by which authority the heretical leaders are shown to be refuted.</strong></p>

<p>54. It is plain, therefore, that the Son is not unlike the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and so we may confess the more readily that He is also <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, seeing that He Who is like the Eternal must needs be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But if we say that the Father is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and yet deny this of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, we say that the Son is unlike the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for the temporal differs from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. The Prophet proclaims Him <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and the Apostle proclaims Him <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; the Testaments, Old and New alike, are full of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the Son's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</p>

<p>55. Let us take them, then, in their order. In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>&mdash; to cite one out of a multitude of testimonies&mdash; it is written: <q>Before Me has there been no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and after Me shall there be none.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341775"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;43:10</a></span> I will not comment on this place, but ask you straight: <q>Who speaks these words&mdash;the Father or the Son?</q> Whichever of the two you say, you will find yourself convinced, or, if a believer, instructed. Who, then, speaks these words, the Father or the Son? If it is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He says, <q>Before Me has there been no other <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> if the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He says, <q>After Me shall there be none.</q> The One has none before Him, the Other none that comes after; as the Father is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, so also is the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for whenever you speak of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, you speak also by implication of His Son, seeing that none is his own father; and when you name the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, you do also acknowledge His Father, inasmuch as none can be his own son. And so neither can the Son exist without the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the Father without the Son.  The Father, therefore, is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and the Son also <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>56. <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  <q>Was,</q> mark you, <q>with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>Was</q>&mdash; see, we have <q>was</q> four times over. Where did the blasphemer find it written that He <q>was not.</q> Again, John, in another passage&mdash; in his Epistle&mdash; speaks of <q>That which was in the beginning.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341778"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> The extension of the <q>was</q> is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Conceive any length of time you will, yet still the Son <q>was.</q> </p>

<p>57. Now in this short passage our fisherman has barred the way of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For that which was <q>in the beginning</q> is not comprehended in time, is not preceded by any beginning. Let <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, therefore, hold his peace.  Moreover, that which was <q>with God</q> is not confounded and mingled with Him, but is distinguished by the perfection unblemished which it has as the Word abiding with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and so let Sabellius keep silence.  And <q>the Word was God.</q> This Word, therefore, consists not in uttered speech, but in the designation of celestial excellence, so that Photinus' teaching is refuted. Furthermore, by the fact that in the beginning He was with God is proven the indivisible unity of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Godhead in Father and Son, to the shame and confusion of Eunomius.  Lastly, seeing that all things are said to have been made by Him, He is plainly shown to be author of the Old and of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> alike; so that the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> can find no ground for his assaults.  Thus has the good fisherman caught them all in one net, to make them powerless to deceive, albeit unprofitable fish to take.</p>

<h4>Chapter 9.</h4>

<p><strong>St. Ambrose questions the heretics and exhibits their answer, which is, that the Son existed, indeed, before all time, yet was not co-eternal with the Father, whereat the Saint shows that they represent the Godhead as changeable, and further, that each Person must be believed to be eternal.</strong></p>

<p>58. Tell me, thou <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>&mdash;for the surpassing clemency of the Emperor grants me this indulgence of addressing you for a short space, not that I desire to confer with you, or am greedy to hear your arguments, but because I am willing to exhibit them&mdash;tell me, I say, whether there was ever a time when God Almighty was not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and yet was God. <q>I say nothing about time,</q> is your answer. Well and subtly objected! For if you bring time into the dispute, you will condemn yourself, seeing that you must acknowledge that there was a time when the Son was not, whereas the Son is the ruler and creator of time.  He cannot have begun to exist after His own work. You, therefore, must needs allow Him to be the ruler and maker of His work.</p>

<p>59. <q>I do not say,</q> do you answer, that the Son <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not before time; but when I call Him <q>Son,</q> I declare that His Father <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before Him, for, as you say, father exists before son.  But what means this? You deny that time was before the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and yet you will have it that something preceded the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the Son&mdash; some creature of time,&mdash; and you show certain stages of generation intervening, whereby thou dost give us to understand that the generation from the Father was a process in time. For if He began to be a Father, then, in the first instance, He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and afterwards He became a Father. How, then, is God unchangeable?  For if He was first <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, surely He has undergone change by reason of the added and later act of generation.</p>

<p>60. But may God preserve us from this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; for it was but to confute the impiety of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> that we brought in this question. The devout spirit affirms a generation that is not in time, and so declares Father and Son to be co-eternal, and does not maintain that God has ever suffered change.</p>

<p>61. Let Father and Son, therefore, be associated in worship, even as They are associated in Godhead; let not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> put asunder those whom the close bond of generation has joined together. Let us <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that we may <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Father also, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note341787"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;5:23</a></span> The Son's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is the adornment of the Father's majesty. If the Son has not been from everlasting, then the Father has suffered change; but the Son is from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, therefore has the Father never changed, for He is always unchangeable. And thus we see that they who would deny the Son's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> would teach that the Father is mutable.</p>

<h4>Chapter 10.</h4>

<p><strong>Christ's eternity being proved from the Apostle's teaching, St. Ambrose admonishes us that the Divine Generation is not to be thought of after the fashion of human procreation, nor to be too curiously pried into. With the difficulties thence arising he refuses to deal, saying that whatsoever terms, taken from our knowledge of body, are used in speaking of this Divine Generation, must be understood with a spiritual meaning.</strong></p>

<p>62. Hear now another argument, showing clearly the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Son. The Apostle says that God's Power and Godhead are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the Power of God&mdash; for it is written that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is <q>the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  If, then, Christ is the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that, forasmuch as God's Power is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, Christ also is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>63. You can not, then, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, build up a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> from the custom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> procreation, nor yet gather the wherewithal for such work from our discourse, for we cannot compass the greatness of <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> Godhead, <q>of Whose greatness there is no end,</q>  in our straitened speech. If you should seek to give an account of a man's birth, you must needs point to a time. But the Divine Generation is above all things; it reaches far and wide, it rises high above all thought and feeling. For it is written: <q>No man comes to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save by Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341790"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> Whatsoever, therefore, thou dost conceive concerning the Father&mdash; yea, be it even His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>&mdash; you can not conceive anything concerning Him save by the Son's aid, nor can any understanding ascend to the Father save through the Son. <q>This is My dearly-beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q>  the Father says. <q>Is</q> mark you&mdash; He Who is, what He is, forever. Hence also David is moved to say: <q>O Lord, Your Word abides for ever in heaven,</q> &mdash; for what abides fails neither in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> nor in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</p>

<p>64. Do you ask me how He is a Son, if He have not a Father existing before Him? I ask of you, in turn, when, or how, do you think that the Son was begotten. For me the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His generation is more than I can attain to, &mdash; the mind fails, the voice is dumb&mdash; ay, and not mine alone, but the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> also. It is above Powers, above Angels, above Cherubim, Seraphim, and all that has feeling and thought, for it is written: <q>The peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which passes all understanding.</q>  If the peace of Christ passes all understanding, how can so wondrous a generation but be above all understanding?</p>

<p>65. Do thou, then (like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>), cover your face with your hands,  for it is not given you to look into surpassing <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>! We are suffered to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Son is begotten, not to dispute upon the manner of His begetting. I cannot deny the one; the other I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to search into, for if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says that the words which he heard when caught up into the third heaven might not be uttered, <span class="stiki" id="note341796"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:2-5</a></span> how can we explain the secret of this generation from and of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, which we can neither hear nor attain to with our understanding?</p>

<p>66. But if you will constrain me to the rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation, that you may be allowed to say that the Father <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, then consider whether instances, taken from the generation of earthly creatures, are suitable to show forth the Divine Generation.  If we speak according to what is customary among men, you cannot deny that, in man, the changes in the father's <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> happen before those in the son's. The father is the first to grow, to enter old age, to grieve, to weep. If, then, the son is after him in time, he is older in experience than the son. If the child comes to be born, the parent escapes not the shame of begetting. </p>

<p>67. Why take such delight in that rack of questioning?  You hear the name of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; abolish it, then, or acknowledge His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature. You hear speak of the womb&mdash; acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of undoubted begetting.  Of His heart&mdash; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that here is God's word.  Of His right hand&mdash; confess His power.  Of His face&mdash; acknowledge His wisdom.  These words are not to be understood, when we speak of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as when we speak of bodies. The generation of the Son is incomprehensible, the Father begets impassibly,  and yet of Himself and in ages inconceivably remote has very God begotten very God. The Father loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note341805"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;5:20</a></span> and you anxiously examine His Person; the Father is well pleased in Him,  you, joining the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, look upon Him with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> eye; the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,  and you join the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> in reviling Him. <span class="stiki" id="note341808"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;23:36-37</a></span> </p>

<h4>Chapter 11.</h4>

<p><strong>It cannot be proved from Scripture that the Father existed before the Son, nor yet can arguments taken from human reproduction avail to this end, since they bring in absurdities without end. To dare to affirm that Christ began to exist in the course of time is the height of blasphemy.</strong></p>

<p>68. You ask me whether it is possible that He Who is the Father should not be prior in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. I ask you to tell me when the Father <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, the Son as yet being not; prove this, gather it from argument or evidence of Scripture. If you lean upon arguments, you have doubtless been taught that God's power is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Again, you have read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> that says: <q>O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, if you will hearken unto Me, there shall be no new God in you, neither shall you worship a strange God.</q>  The first of these commands betokens [the Son's] <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, the second His possession of an identical nature, so that we can neither <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to have come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor suppose Him the Son of another Divinity. For if He <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not always with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He is a <q>new</q> [God]; if He is not of one Divinity with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He is a <q>strange</q> [God]. But He is not after the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, for He is not <q>a new <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> nor is He <q>a strange <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> for He is begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and because, as it is written, He is <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> above all, blessed for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341810"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> </p>

<p>69. But if the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him to be a strange <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why do they worship Him, when it is written: <q>You shall worship no strange God</q>? Else, if they do not worship the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, let them confess thereto, and the case is at an end&mdash;that they deceive no one by their professions of religion. This, then, we see, is the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. If you have any others to produce, it will be your business to do so.</p>

<p>70. Let us now go further, and gather the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in conclusion from arguments. For although arguments usually give place, even to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> evidence,  still, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, argue as you will. <q>Experience teaches us,</q> you say, <q>that the being which generates is prior to that which is generated.</q> I answer: Follow our customary experience through all its departments, and if the rest agree herewith, I oppose not your claim that your point be granted; but if there be no such agreement, how can you claim assent on this one point, when in all the rest you lack support? Seeing, then, that you call for what is customary, it comes about that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, when He was begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, was a little child. You have seen Him an infant, crying in the cradle. As the years passed, He has gone forward from strength to strength&mdash; for if He was weak with the weakness of things begotten, He must also have fallen under the weakness, not only of birth, but of life also.</p>

<p>71. But perchance you run to such a pitch of folly as not to flinch from asserting these things of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, measuring Him, as you do, by the rule of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity. What, then, if, while you cannot refuse Him the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you are bent to prove Him, by reason of weakness, to be a man? What if, while you examine the Person of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, you are calling the Father in question, and while you hastily pass sentence upon the Former, you include the Latter in the same condemnation!</p>

<p>72. If the Divine Generation has been subject to the limits of time,&mdash; if we suppose this, borrowing from the custom of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation, then it follows, further, that the Father bare the Son in a bodily womb, and laboured under the burden while ten months sped their courses. But how can generation, as it commonly takes place, be brought about without the help of the other sex? You see that the common order of generation was not the commencement, and you think that the courses of generation, which are ruled by certain necessities whereunto bodies are subject, have always prevailed. You require the customary course, I ask for difference of sex: you demand the supposition of time, I that of order: you enquire into the end, I into the beginning. Now surely it is the end that depends on the beginning, not the beginning on the end.</p>

<p>73. <q>Everything,</q> say you, <q>that is begotten has a beginning, and therefore because the Son is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He has a beginning, and came first into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> within limits of time.</q> Let this be taken as the word of their own mouth; as for myself, I confess that the Son is begotten, but the rest of their declaration makes me shudder. Man, do you confess <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and diminish His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by such <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>? From this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> may God deliver us.</p>

<h4>Chapter 12.</h4>

<p><strong>Further objections to the Godhead of the Son are met by the same answer&mdash; to wit, that they may equally be urged against the Father also. The Father, then, being in no way confined by time, place, or anything else created, no such limitation is to be imposed upon the Son, Whose marvellous generation is not only of the Father, but of the Virgin also, and therefore, since in His generation of the Father no distinction of sex, or the like, was involved, neither was it in His generation of the Virgin.</strong></p>

<p>74. The next objection is this: <q>If the Son has not those properties which all sons have, He is no Son.</q> May Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> pardon me, for I would propound the question in all devoutness. Surely the Father is, and abides for ever: <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things, too, are as God has ordained them. Is there any one, then, among these creatures which is not subject to the limitations of place, time, or the fact of having been created, or to some originating <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or creator.  Surely, none. What, then? Is there any one of them whereof the Father stands in need? So to say were <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. Cease, then, to apply to the Godhead what is proper only to created existences, or, if you insist upon forcing the comparison, bethink you whither your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> leads. God forbid that we should even behold the end thereof.</p>

<p>75. We maintain the answer given by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. God is Almighty, and therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father needs none of those things, for in Him there is no changing, nor any place for such help as we need, we whose weakness is supported by means of things of this kind. But He Who is Almighty, plainly He is uncreate, and not confined to any place, and surpasses time. Before God was not anything&mdash; nay, even to speak about anything being before God is a grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If, then, you grant that in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father there is nought that implies a being sustained, because He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it follows that nothing of this sort can be supposed to exist in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, nothing that connotes a beginning, or growth, forasmuch as He is <q>very God of very God.</q> </p>

<p>76. Seeing, then, that we find not the customary order prevailing, be content, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a miraculous generation of the Son. Be content, I say, and if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me not, at least have respect unto the voice of God saying, <q>To whom have you esteemed Me to be like?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341814"><a href="../bible/isa046.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;46:5</a></span> and again: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not like a man that He should repent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341815"><a href="../bible/num023.htm#verse19">Numbers&nbsp;23:19</a></span> If, indeed, God works mysteriously, seeing that He does not work any work, or fashion anything, or bring it to completion, by labor of hands, or in any course of days, <q>for He spoke, and they were made; He gave the word and they were created,</q>  why should we not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He Whom we acknowledge as a Creator, mysteriously working, discerning it in His works, also begot His Son in a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> manner? Surely it is fitting that He should be regarded as having begotten the Son in a special and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> way. Let Him Who has the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of majesty unrivalled likewise have the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> generation.</p>

<p>77. Not only Christ's generation of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but His birth also of the Virgin, demands our wonder. You say that the former is like the manner wherein we men are conceived. I will show&mdash; nay more, I will compel you yourself to confess, that the latter also has no likeness to the manner of our birth. Tell me how it was that He was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, with what law did His conception in a Virgin's womb agree, how there could be any birth without the seed of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, how a maiden could become great with child, how she became a mother before experience of such intercourse as is between wives and husbands. There was no [visible] <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>&mdash;and yet a son was begotten. How, then, came about this birth, under a new law?</p>

<p>78. If, then, the common order of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> generation was not found in the case of the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, how can you demand that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father should beget in such wise as you were begotten in? Surely the common order is determined by difference of sex; for this is implanted in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our flesh, but where flesh is not, how can you expect to find the infirmity of flesh? No man calls in question one who is better than he is: to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is enjoined upon you, without permission to question. For it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341817"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;15:6</a></span> Language is vain to set forth, not only the generation of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but even the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it is written: <q>All His works are executed in faithfulness;</q>  His works, then, are done in faithfulness, but not His generation? Ay, we call in question that which we see not, we who are bidden to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> rather than enquire of that we see.</p>

<h4>Chapter 13.</h4>

<p><strong>Discussion of the Divine Generation is continued. St. Ambrose illustrates its method by the same example as that employed by the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. The duty of believing what is revealed is shown by the example of Nebuchadnezzar and St. Peter. By the vision granted to St. Peter was shown the Son's Eternity and Godhead&mdash; the Apostle, then, must be believed in preference to the teachers of philosophy, whose authority was everywhere falling into discredit. The Arians, on the other hand, are shown to be like the heathen.</strong></p>

<p>79. It will be asked: <q>In what sort was the Son begotten?</q> As one who is for ever, as the Word, as the brightness of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> light, <span class="stiki" id="note341819"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse3">Hebrews&nbsp;1:3</a></span> for brightness takes effect in the instant of its coming into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Which example is the Apostle's, not mine. Think not, then, that there was ever a moment of time when God was without wisdom, any more than that there was ever a time when light was without radiance. Judge not, <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, divine things by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the divine where you find not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>.</p>

<p>80. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> king saw in the fire, together with the three Hebrew children, the form of a fourth, like as of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note341820"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse25">Daniel&nbsp;3:25</a></span> and because he thought that this <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> excelled all <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, he judged Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Whom he had not read of, but in Whom he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, also, saw Three, and adored One. <span class="stiki" id="note341821"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;18:1-3</a></span> </p>

<p>81. Peter, when he saw <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias on the mountain, with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, was not deceived as to their nature and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For he enquired, not of them, but of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, what he ought to do, inasmuch as though he prepared to do homage to all three, yet he waited for the command of one. But since he <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> thought that for three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> three tabernacles should be set up, he was corrected by the sovereign voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying, <q>This is My dearly beloved Son: hear Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341822"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;17:5</a></span> That is to say: <q>Why do you join your fellow-servants in equality with your Lord?</q> <q>This is My Son.</q> Not <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is My Son,</q> nor <q>Elias is My Son,</q> but <q>This is My Son.</q> The Apostle was not dull to understand the rebuke; he fell on his face, brought low by the Father's voice and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> beauty of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but he was raised up by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, Whose wont it is to raise up them that are fallen. <span class="stiki" id="note341823"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;17:6-8</a></span> Then he saw one only, <span class="stiki" id="note341824"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;17:8</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> alone, for the servants had withdrawn, that He might be seen to be Lord alone, Who alone was entitled Son.</p>

<p>82. What, then, was the purpose of that vision, which signified not that Christ and His servants were equal, but betokened a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, save that it should be made plain to us that the Law and the Prophets, in agreement with the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, revealed as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Whom they had heralded. When we, therefore, hear of the Son coming forth of the womb, the Word from the heart, let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Son was not fashioned with hands but begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not the work of a craftsman but the offspring of a parent.</p>

<p>83. He, therefore, Who said, <q>This is My Son,</q> said not, <q>This is a creature of time,</q> nor <q>This being is of My creation, My making, My servant,</q> but <q>This is My Son, Whom you see <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> This is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, Who appeared to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the bush, <span class="stiki" id="note341825"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> concerning Whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, <q>He Who is has sent me.</q> It was not the Father Who spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the bush or in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, but the Son. It was of this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that Stephen said, <q>This is He Who was in the church, in the wilderness, with the Angel.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341826"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;7:38</a></span> This, then, is He Who gave the Law, Who spoke with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.</q> This, then, is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the patriarchs, this is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<p>84. It is of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, therefore, that we read, your mind understands the reading, let your tongue make confession. Away with arguments, where <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is required; now let dialectic hold her peace, even in the midst of her schools. I ask not what it is that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> say, but I would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they do. They sit desolate in their schools. See the victory of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> over argument. They who dispute subtly are forsaken daily by their fellows; they who with simplicity <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> are daily increased. Not <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> but fishermen, not masters of dialectic but tax-gatherers, now find credence. The one sort, through pleasures and luxuries, have bound the world's burden upon themselves; the other, by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and mortification, have cast it off, and so does sorrow now begin to win over more followers than pleasure.</p>

<p>85. Let us now see how far <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> do differ. The latter call upon gods, who are different in sex and unequal in power; the former affirm a Trinity where there is likewise inequality of power and diversity of Godhead. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> assert that their Gods began to exist once upon a time; the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> lyingly declare that Christ began to exist in the course of time. Have they not all dyed their impiety in the vats of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? But indeed the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> do extol that which they worship,  the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> maintain that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is a creature.</p>

<h4>Chapter 14.</h4>

<p><strong>That the Son of God is not a created being is proved by the following arguments: (1) That He commanded not that the Gospel should be preached to Himself; (2) that a created being is given over unto vanity; (3) that the Son has created all things; (4) that we read of Him as begotten; and (5) that the difference of generation and adoption has always been understood in those places where both natures&mdash; the divine and the human&mdash; are declared to co-exist in Him. All of which testimony is confirmed by the Apostle's interpretation.</strong></p>

<p>86. It is now made plain, as I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, your sacred Majesty, that the Lord Jesus is neither unlike the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor one that began to exist in course of time. We have yet to confute another <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and to show that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not a created being. Herein is the quickening  word that we read as our help, for we have heard the passage read where the Lord says: <q>Go into all the world, and preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to all creation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341829"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse15">Mark&nbsp;16:15</a></span> He Who says <q>all creation</q> excepts nothing. How, then, do they stand who call Christ a <q>creature</q>? If He were a creature, could He have commanded that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> should be preached to Himself? It is not, therefore, a creature, but the Creator, Who commits to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the work of teaching created beings.</p>

<p>87. Christ, then, is no created being; for <q>created beings are,</q> as the Apostle has said, <q>given over to vanity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341830"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;8:20</a></span> Is Christ given over unto vanity? Again, <q>creation</q>&mdash; according to the same Apostle&mdash; <q>groans and travails together even until now.</q> What, then? Does Christ take any part in this groaning and travailing&mdash; He Who has set us miserable mourners free from death? <q>Creation,</q> says the Apostle, <q>shall be set free from the slavery of corruption.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341831"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;8:21-22</a></span> We see, then, that between creation and its Lord there is a vast difference, for creation is enslaved, but <q>the Lord is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is, there is freedom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341832"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> </p>

<p>88. Who was it that led first into this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, of declaring Him Who created and made all things to be a creature? Did the Lord, I would ask, create Himself? We read that <q>all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341833"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> This being so, did He make Himself? We read&mdash; and who shall deny?&mdash; that in wisdom has God made all things.  If so, how can we suppose that wisdom was made in itself?</p>

<p>89. We read that the Son is begotten, inasmuch as the Father says: <q>I brought you forth from the womb before the morning star.</q>  We read of the <q><a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a></q> Son, <span class="stiki" id="note341836"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> of the <q>only-begotten</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341837"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> &mdash; <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, because there is none before Him; only-begotten, because there is none after Him. Again, we read: <q>Who shall declare His generation?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341838"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span> <q>Generation,</q> mark you, not <q>creation.</q> What argument can be brought to meet testimonies so great and mighty as these?</p>

<p>90. Moreover, God's Son discovers the difference between generation and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> when He says: <q>I go up to My Father and your Father, to My God and your God.</q>  He did not say, <q>I go up to our Father,</q> but <q>I go up to My Father and your Father.</q> This distinction is the sign of a difference, inasmuch as He Who is Christ's Father is our Creator.</p>

<p>91. Furthermore He said, <q>to My God and your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> because although He and the Father are One, and the Father is His Father by possession of the same nature, while God began to be our Father through the office of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not by virtue of nature, but of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>&mdash; still He seems to point us here to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in Christ of both natures, Godhead and Manhood,&mdash; Godhead of His Father, Manhood of His Mother, the former being before all things, the latter derived from the Virgin. For the first, speaking as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He called God His Father, and afterward, speaking as man, named Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>92. Everywhere, indeed, we have <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to show that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in naming God as His <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does so as man. <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have You forsaken Me?</q>  And again: <q>From My mother's womb You are My God.</q>  In the former place He suffers as a man; in the latter it is a man who is brought forth from his mother's womb. And so when He says, <q>From My mother's womb You are My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> He means that He Who was always His Father is His God from the moment when He was brought forth from His Mother's womb.</p>

<p>93. Seeing, then, that we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in the Apostle, in the Prophets, of Christ as begotten, how dare the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> to say that He was created or made? But, indeed, they ought to have bethought them, where they have read of Him as created, where as made. For it has been plainly shown that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born of God&mdash; let them, then, consider with care where they have read that He was made, seeing that He was not made <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but born as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; afterward, however, He was, according to the flesh, made man of Mary.</p>

<p>94. <q>But when the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son, <em>made</em> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, made under the Law.</q>  <q> <em>His</em> Son,</q> observe, not as one of many, not as His in common with another, but His own, and in saying <q>His Son,</q> the Apostle showed that it is of the Son's nature that His generation is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Him the Apostle has affirmed to have been afterwards <q>made</q> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, in order that the making might be understood not of the Godhead, but of the putting on of a body&mdash; <q>made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> then, by taking on of flesh; <q>made under the Law</q> through observance of the Law. Howbeit, the former, the spiritual generation is before the Law was, the latter is after the Law.</p>

<h4>Chapter 15.</h4>

<p><strong> <em>An explanation of</em> <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse36">Acts 2:36</a> <em>and</em> <!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/pro008.htm#verse22">Proverbs 8:22</a> <em>, which are shown to refer properly to Christ's manhood alone.</em></strong></p>

<p>95. To no purpose, then, is the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics'</a> customary citation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made Him both Lord and Christ.</q> Let these <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> read the whole passage, and understand it. For thus it is written. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made this Jesus, Whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ.</q>  It was not the Godhead, but the flesh, that was crucified. This, indeed, was possible, because the flesh allowed of being crucified. It follows not, then, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is a created being.</p>

<p>96. Let us dispatch, then, that passage also, which they do use to misrepresent,&mdash; let them learn what is the sense of the words, <q>The Lord created Me.</q>  It is not <q>the Father created,</q> but <q>the Lord created Me.</q> The flesh acknowledges its Lord, praise declares the Father: our created nature confesses the first, loves, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the latter. Who, then, cannot but perceive that these words announce the Incarnation? Thus the Son speaks of Himself as created in respect of that wherein he witnesses to Himself as being man, when He says, <q>Why do you seek to kill Me, a <em>man</em>, Who have told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</q> He speaks of His Manhood, wherein He was crucified, and died, and was buried.</p>

<p>97. Furthermore, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that the writer set down as past that which was to come; for this is the usage of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, that things to come are spoken of as though they were already present or past. For example, in the twenty-first  psalm you have read: <q>Fat bulls (of Bashan) have beset me,</q> and again:  <q>They parted My garments among them.</q> This the Evangelist shows to have been spoken <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> of the time of the Passion, for to God the things that are to come are present, and for Him Who foreknows all things, they are as though they were past and over; as it is written, <q>Who has made the things that are to be.</q> </p>

<p>98. It is no wonder that He should declare His place to have been set fast before all worlds, seeing that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> tells us that He was foreordained before the times and ages. The following passage discovers how the words in question present themselves as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of the Incarnation: <q>Wisdom has built her an house, and set up seven pillars to support it, and she has slain her victims. She has mingled her wine in the bowl, and made ready her table, and sent her servants, calling men together with a mighty voice of proclamation, saying: 'He who is simple, let him turn in to me.'</q>  Do we not see, in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that all these things were fulfilled after the Incarnation, in that Christ disclosed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the Holy Supper, sent forth His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and cried with a loud voice, saying, <q>If any man thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341849"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37</a></span> That which follows, then, answers to that which went before, and we behold the whole story of the Incarnation set forth in brief by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.</p>

<p>99. Many other passages might readily be seen to be prophecies of this sort concerning the Incarnation, but I will not delay over books, lest the treatise appear too wordy</p>

<h4>Chapter 16.</h4>

<p><strong>The Arians blaspheme Christ, if by the words <q>created</q> and <q>begotten</q> they mean and understand one and the same thing. If, however, they regard the words as distinct in meaning, they must not speak of Him, of Whom they have read that He was begotten, as if He were a created being. This rule is upheld by the witness of St. Paul, who, professing himself a servant of Christ, forbade worship of a created being. God being a substance pure and uncompounded, there is no created nature in Him; furthermore, the Son is not to be degraded to the level of things created, seeing that in Him the Father is well pleased.</strong></p>

<p>100. Now will I enquire particularly of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, whether they think that begotten and created are one and the same. If they call them the same, then is there no difference between generation and creation. It follows, then, that forasmuch as we also are created, there is between us and Christ and the elements no difference. Thus much, however, great as their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is, they will not venture to say.</p>

<p>101. Furthermore&mdash; to concede that which is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to their folly&mdash; I ask them, if there is, as they think, no difference in the words, why do they not call upon Him Whom they worship by the better title? Why do they not avail themselves of the Father's word?  Why do they reject the title of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and use a dishonouring name?</p>

<p>102. If, however, there is&mdash; as I think there is&mdash; a distinction between <q>created</q> and <q>begotten,</q> then, when we have read that He is begotten, we shall surely not understand the same by the terms <q>begotten</q> and <q>created.</q> Let them therefore confess Him to be begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, born of the Virgin, or let them say how the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> can be both begotten and created. A single nature, above all, the Divine Being, rejects strife (within itself).</p>

<p>103. But in any case let our private judgment pass: let us enquire of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and so foreseeing these questionings, has given sentence against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> in general and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> in particular, saying that they were by God's judgment condemned, who served the creature rather than the Creator. Thus, in fact, you may read: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave them over to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of their own heart, that they might one with another dishonour their bodies, they who changed God's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> into a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, and worshipped and served the thing created rather than the Creator, Who is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, blessed for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341851"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;1:24-25</a></span> </p>

<p>104. Thus <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> forbids me to worship a creature, and admonishes me of my duty to serve Christ. It follows, then, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not a created being. The Apostle calls himself <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341852"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and this good servant, who acknowledges his Lord, will likewise have us not worship that which is created. How, then, could he have been himself a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if he thought that Christ was a created person? Let these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, then, cease either to worship Him Whom they call a created being, or to call Him a creature, Whom they feign to worship, lest under colour of being worshippers they fall into worse impiety. For a domestic is worse than a foreign foe, and that these men should use the Name of Christ to Christ's dishonour increases their guilt.</p>

<p>105. What better expounder of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> do we indeed look for than that teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that chosen vessel&mdash; chosen from the number of the persecutors? He who had been the persecutor of Christ confesses Him. He had read Solomon more, in any case, than <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> has, and he was well learned in the Law, and so, because he had read, he said not that Christ was created, but that He was begotten. For he had read, <q>He spoke, and they were made: He commanded, and they were created.</q>  Was Christ, I ask, made at a word? Was He created at a command?</p>

<p>106. Moreover, <em>how</em> can there be any created nature in God? In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, God is of an uncompounded nature; nothing can be added to Him, and that alone which is Divine has He in His nature; filling all things,  yet nowhere Himself confounded with anything; penetrating all things, yet Himself nowhere to be penetrated; present in all His fullness at one and the same moment, in heaven, in earth, in the deepest depth of the sea,  to sight invisible, by speech not to be declared, by feeling not to be measured; to be followed by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to be adored with devotion; so that whatsoever title excels in depth of spiritual import, in setting forth <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, in exalting power, this you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to belong of right to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>107. Since, then, the Father is well pleased in the Son; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Son is worthy of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that He came out from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as He Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, saying: <q>I went out from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have come;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341856"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse42">John&nbsp;8:42</a></span> and again: <q>I went out from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341857"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;16:27</a></span> He Who proceeded and came forth from God can have no attributes but such as are proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h4>Chapter 17.</h4>

<p><strong>That Christ is very God is proved from the fact that He is God's own Son, also from His having been begotten and having come forth from God, and further, from the unity of will and operation subsisting in Father and Son. The witness of the apostles and of the centurion&mdash; which St. Ambrose sets over against the Arian teaching&mdash; is adduced, together with that of Isaiah and St. John.</strong></p>

<p>108. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is not only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but very God indeed&mdash; very God of very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, insomuch that He Himself is the Truth. <span class="stiki" id="note341858"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> If, then, we enquire His Name, it is <q>the Truth;</q> if we seek to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His natural rank and dignity, He is so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, that He is indeed God's <em>own</em> Son; as it is written, <q>Who spared not His own Son, but gave Him up for our sakes,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341859"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> gave Him up, that is, so far as the flesh was concerned. That He is God's own Son declares His Godhead; that He is very God shows that He is God's own Son; His pitifulness is the earnest of His submission, His <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>109. Lest, however, men should wrest the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave Him up,</q> the Apostle himself has said in another place, <span class="stiki" id="note341860"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse3">Galatians&nbsp;1:3-4</a></span> <q>Peace from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Who gave Himself for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q> and again: <span class="stiki" id="note341861"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> <q>Even as Christ has loved us, and given Himself for us.</q> If, then, He both was given up by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and gave Himself up of His own accord, it is plain that the working and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Father and Son is one.</p>

<p>110. If, then, we enquire into His natural pre-eminence, we find it to consist in being begotten. To deny that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is begotten [of God] is to deny that He is God's <em>own</em> Son, and to deny Christ to be God's own Son is to class Him with the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, as no more a Son than any of the rest. If, however, we enquire into the distinctive property of His generation, it is this, that He came forth from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For while, in our experience, to come out implies something already existent, and that which is said to come out seems to proceed forth from hidden and inward places, we, though it be presented but in short passages, observe the peculiar attribute of the Divine Generation, that the Son does not seem to have come forth out of any place, but as God from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a Son from a Father, nor to have had a beginning in the course of time, having come forth from the Father by being born, as He Himself Who was born said: <q>I came forth from the mouth of the Most High.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341862"><a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse3">Sirach&nbsp;24:3</a></span> </p>

<p>111. But if the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> acknowledge not the Son's nature, if they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, let them at least <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the mighty works. To whom does the Father say, <q>Let <em>us</em> make man?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341863"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> save to Him Whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son? In Whom, save in one who was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, could He recognize His Image? The son by adoption is not the same as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son; nor would the Son say, <q>I and the Father are one,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341864"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;10:30</a></span> if He, being Himself not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, were measuring Himself with One Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The Father, therefore, says, <q>Let us make.</q> He Who spoke is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; can He, then, Who made be not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Shall the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> rendered to Him Who speaks be withheld from Him Who makes?</p>

<p>112. But how, unless the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son, should He commend to Him His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, for perfect co-operation, and His works, for perfect bringing in out in actuality? Seeing that the Son works the works which the Father does, and that the Son quickens whom He will,  as it is written, He is then equal in power and free in respect of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. And thus is the Unity maintained, forasmuch as God's power consists in that the Godhead is proper to each Person, and freedom lies not in any difference, but in unity of will.</p>

<p>113. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, being storm-tossed in the sea, as soon as they saw the waters leaping up round their Lord's feet, and beheld His fearless footsteps on the water, as He walked amid the raging waves of the sea, and the ship, which was beaten upon by the waves, had rest as soon as Christ entered it, and they saw the waves and the winds <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> Him&mdash;then, though as yet they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in their hearts they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him to be God's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son, saying, <q>Truly You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341866"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;14:33</a></span> </p>

<p>114. To the same effect the confession of the centurion, and others who were with him, when the foundations of the world were shaken at the Lord's Passion,&mdash; and this, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, you deny. The centurion said, <q>Truly this was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341867"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse54">Matthew&nbsp;27:54</a></span> <q>Was</q> said the centurion&mdash; <q>Was <em>not</em></q> says the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>. The centurion, then, with bloodstained hands, but devout <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, declares both the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> generation; and thou, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, deniest its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and makest it matter of time! Would that you had imbued your hands rather than your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! But you, unclean even of hand, and murderous of intent, seekest Christ's death, so far as in you lies, seeing that you think of Him as mean and weak; nay, and this is a worse <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, you, albeit the Godhead can feel no wound, still would do your diligence to slay in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not His Body, but His Glory.</p>

<p>115. We cannot then <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that He is very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead even executioners <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in and devils confessed. Their testimony we require not now, but it is withal greater than your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>. We have called them in to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, to put you to the blush, while we have also cited the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the end that you should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>116. The Lord proclaims by the mouth of Isaiah: <q>In the mouth of them that serve Me shall a new name be called upon, which shall be blessed over all the earth, and they shall bless the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and they who <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> upon earth shall <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341868"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;65:16</a></span> These words, I say, Isaiah spoke when he saw God's Glory, and thus in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> it is plainly said that he saw the Glory of Christ and spoke of Him. <span class="stiki" id="note341869"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse41">John&nbsp;12:41</a></span> </p>

<p>117. But hear again what John the Evangelist has written in his Epistle, saying: <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has appeared, and has given us discernment, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to be in His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our Lord. He is very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Life Eternal.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341870"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:20</a></span> John calls Him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and very God. If, then, He be very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He is surely uncreate, without spot of lying or deceit, having in Himself no confusion, nor unlikeness to His Father.</p>

<h4>Chapter 18.</h4>

<p><strong>The errors of the Arians are mentioned in the Nicene Definition of the Faith, to prevent their deceiving anybody. These errors are recited, together with the anathema pronounced against them, which is said to have been not only pronounced at Nic&aelig;a, but also twice renewed at Ariminum.</strong></p>

<p>118. Christ, therefore, is <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Light of Light, very God of very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, not made; of one substance with the Father.</q></p>

<p>119. So, indeed, following the guidance of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, our fathers declared, holding, moreover, that impious doctrines should be included in the record of their decrees, in order that the unbelief of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> should discover itself, and not, as it were, mask itself with dye or face-paint.  For they give a false colour to their thoughts who dare not unfold them openly. After the manner of the censor's rolls, then, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is not discovered by name,  but marked out by the condemnation pronounced, in order that he who is curious and eager to hear it should be preserved from falling by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is condemned already, before he hears, it set forth to the end that he should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>120. <q>Those,</q> runs the decree, <q>who say that there was a time when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was not, and that before He was born He was not, and who say that he was made out of nothing, or is of another substance or <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>,  or that He is capable of changing, or that with Him is any shadow of turning&mdash;them the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church declares accursed.</q></p>

<p>121. Your sacred Majesty has agreed that they who utter such doctrines are rightly condemned. It was of no determination by man, of no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> counsel, that three hundred and eighteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> met, as I showed above more at length,  in Council, but that in their number the Lord Jesus might prove, by the sign of His Name and Passion, that He was in the midst, where His own were gathered together. <span class="stiki" id="note341875"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;18:20</a></span> In the number of three hundred was the sign of His Cross, in that of eighteen was the sign of the Name Jesus.</p>

<p>122. This also was the teaching of the First Confession in the Council of Ariminum, and of the Second Correction, after that Council. Of the Confession, the letter sent to the Emperor Constantine bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and the Council that followed declares the Correction. </p>

<h4>Chapter 19.</h4>

<p><strong>Arius is charged with the first of the above-mentioned errors, and refuted by the testimony of St. John. The miserable death of the Heresiarch is described, and the rest of his blasphemous errors are one by one examined and disproved.</strong></p>

<p>123. <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a></span>, then, says: <q>There was a time when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not,</q> but <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: <q>He was,</q> not that <q>He was not.</q> Furthermore, St. John has written: <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341877"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1-3</a></span> Observe how often the verb <q>was</q> appears, whereas <q>was not</q> is nowhere found. Whom, then, are we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>?&mdash; St. John, who lay on Christ's bosom, or <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, wallowing amid the outgush of his very bowels?&mdash; so wallowing that we might understand how <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> in his teaching showed himself like Judas, being visited with like punishment.</p>

<p>124. For <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius'</a> bowels also gushed out&mdash; decency forbids to say where&mdash; and so he burst asunder in the midst, falling headlong, and besmirching those foul lips wherewith he had denied Christ. He was rent, even as the Apostle Peter said of Judas, because he <q>bought a field with the price of evil-doing, and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.</q>  It was no chance manner of death, seeing that like <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> was visited with like punishment, to the end that those who denied and betrayed the same Lord might likewise undergo the same torment.</p>

<p>125. Let us pass on to further points. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> says: <q>Before He was born, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was not,</q> but the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that all things are maintained in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> by the Son's office. How, then, could He, Who <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not, bestow <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> upon others? Again, when the blasphemer uses the words <q>when</q> and <q>before,</q> he certainly uses words which are marks of time. How, then, do the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> deny that time was ere the Son was, and yet will have things created in time to exist before the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, seeing that the very words, <q>when,</q> <q>before,</q> and <q>did not exist once,</q> announce the idea of time?</p>

<p>126. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> says that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> came into being out of nought. How, then, is He <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; how was He begotten from the womb of the Father&mdash; how do we read of Him as the Word spoken of the heart's abundance, save to the end that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He came forth, as it is written, from the Father's inmost, unapproachable sanctuary? Now a son is so called either by means of adoption or by nature, as we are called sons by means of adoption.  Christ is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> by virtue of His real and abiding nature. How, then, can He, Who out of nothing fashioned all things, be Himself created out of nothing?</p>

<p>127. He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not whence the Son is has not the Son. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore had not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not whence He was. Wherefore the Lord said to them: <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence I came;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341880"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;8:14</a></span> and again: <q>You neither have found out Who I am, nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> My Father,</q> for he who denies that the Son is of the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of Whom the Son is; and again, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the Father.</p>

<p>128. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> says: <q>[The Son is] of another Substance.</q> But what other substance is exalted to equality with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, so that simply in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> thereof He is <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? Or what right have the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> for censuring us because we speak, in Greek, of the <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, or in Latin, of the <em>Substantia</em> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when they themselves, in saying that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is of another <q>Substance,</q> assert a divine <em>Substantia</em>.</p>

<p>129. Howbeit, should they desire to dispute the use of the words <q>divine Substance</q> or <q>divine Nature,</q> they shall easily be refuted, for Holy Writ oft-times has spoken of <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> in Greek, or <em>Substantia</em> in Latin, and St. Peter, as we read, would have us become partakers in the divine Nature. But if they will have it that the Son is of another <q>Substance,</q> they with their own lips confute themselves, in that they both acknowledge the term <q>Substance,</q> whereof they are so afraid, and rank the Son on a level with the creatures above which they feign to exalt Him.</p>

<p>130. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> calls the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> a creature, but <q>not as the rest of the creatures.</q> Yet what created being is not different from another? Man is not as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, earth is not as heaven, the sun is not as water, nor light as darkness. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius'</a> preference, therefore, is empty&mdash; he has but disguised with a sorry dye his deceitful <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, in order to take the foolish.</p>

<p>131. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> declares that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> may change and swerve. How, then, is He God if He is changeable, seeing that He Himself has said: <q>I am, I am, and I change not</q>? </p>

<h4>Chapter 20.</h4>

<p><strong>St. Ambrose declares his desire that some angel would fly to him to purify him, as once the Seraph did to Isaiah&mdash; nay more, that Christ Himself would come to him, to the Emperor, and to his readers, and finally prays that Gratian and the rest of the faithful may be exalted by the power and spell of the Lord's Cup, which he describes in mystic language.</strong></p>

<p>132. Howbeit, now must I needs confess the Prophet Isaiah's confession, which he makes before declaring the word of the Lord: <q>Woe is me, my heart is smitten, for I, a man of unclean lips, and living in the midst of a people of unclean lips, have seen the Lord of Sabaoth.</q>  Now if Isaiah said <q>Woe is me,</q> who looked upon the Lord of Sabaoth, what shall I say of myself, who, being <q>a man of unclean lips,</q> am constrained to treat of the divine generation? How shall I break forth into speech of things whereof I am afraid, when David <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that a watch may be set over his mouth in the matter of things whereof he has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>?  O that to me also one of the Seraphim would bring the burning coal from the celestial altar, taking it in the tongs of the two testaments, and with the fire thereof purge my unclean lips!</p>

<p>133. But forasmuch as then the Seraph came down in a vision to the Prophet, while You, O Lord, in revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> have come to us in the flesh,  do Thou, not by any deputy, nor by any messenger, but You Yourself cleanse my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from my secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that I too, erstwhile unclean, but now by Your mercy made clean through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, may sing in the words of David: <q>I will make music to You upon a harp, O God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, my lips shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, in all my song to You, and so, too, shall my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whom You have redeemed.</q> </p>

<p>134. And so, O Lord, leaving them that <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> You, come unto us, sanctify the ears of our sovereign ruler, Gratian, and all besides into whose hands this little book shall come&mdash; and purge my ears, that no stains of the infidelity they have heard remain anywhere. Cleanse thoroughly, then, our ears, not with water of well, river, or rippling and purling brook, but with words cleansing like water, clearer than any water, and purer than any snow&mdash; even the words You have spoken&mdash; <q>Though your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341886"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;1:18</a></span> </p>

<p>135. Moreover, there is a Cup, which You use to purify the hidden chambers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, a Cup not of the old order,  nor filled from a common Vine,&mdash; a new Cup, brought down from heaven to earth,  filled with wine pressed from the wondrous cluster, which hung in fleshly form upon the tree of the Cross, even as the grape hangs upon the Vine. From this Cluster, then, is the Wine that makes glad the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note341889"><a href="../bible/jdg009.htm#verse13">Judges&nbsp;9:13</a></span> uplifts the sorrowful, is fragrant with, pours into us, the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> devotion, and purity.</p>

<p>136. With this Wine, therefore, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cleanse the spiritual ears of our sovereign Emperor, to the end that, just as men, being uplifted with common wine, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> rest and quietness, cast out the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, have no feeling of injuries,  seek not that which belongs to others, and forget their own; and so he, too, intoxicated with your wine, may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> peace, and, confident in the exultation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, may never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the death of unbelief, and may display loving patience, have no part in other men's profanities,  and hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of more account even than kindred and children, as it is written: <q>Leave all that you have, and come, follow Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note341892"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> </p>

<p>137. With this Wine, also, Lord Jesus, purify our senses, that we may adore You, and worship You, the Creator of things visible and invisible. Truly, You can not fail of being Yourself invisible and good, Who hast given invisibility and goodness to the works of Your Hands. </p>
