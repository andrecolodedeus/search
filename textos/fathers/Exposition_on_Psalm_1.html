<h1>Exposition on Psalm 1</h1>

<p>1. <q>Blessed is the man that has not gone away in the counsel of the ungodly</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse1">Psalm 1:1</a></span>. This is to be understood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Lord Man.  <q>Blessed is the man that has not gone away in the counsel of the ungodly,</q> as <q>the man of earth did,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180007"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse47">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:47</a></span> who consented to his wife deceived by the serpent, to the transgressing the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Nor stood in the way of sinners.</q> For He came indeed in the way of sinners, by being born as sinners are; but He <q>stood</q> not therein, for that the enticements of the world held Him not. <q>And has not sat in the seat of pestilence.</q> He willed not an earthly kingdom, with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, which is well taken for <q>the seat of pestilence;</q> for that there is hardly any one who is free from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of rule, and craves not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For a <q>pestilence</q> is disease widely spread, and involving all or nearly all. Yet <q>the seat of pestilence</q> may be more appropriately understood of hurtful doctrine; <q>whose word spreads as a canker.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180008"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:17</a></span> The order too of the words must be considered: <q>went away, stood, sat.</q> For he <q>went away,</q> when he drew back from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He <q>stood,</q> when he took pleasure in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He <q>sat,</q> when, confirmed in his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, he could not go back, unless set free by Him, who neither <q>has gone away in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of pestilence.</q></p>

<p>2. <q>But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law will he meditate by day and by night <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse2">Psalm 1:2</a></span>. The law is not made for a righteous man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180009"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:9</a></span> says the Apostle. But it is one thing to be in the law, another under the law. Whoso is in the law, acts according to the law; whoso is under the law, is acted upon according to the law: the one therefore is free, the other a slave. Again, the law, which is written and imposed upon the servant, is one thing; the law, which is mentally discerned by him who needs not its <q>letter,</q> is another thing. <q>He will meditate by day and by night,</q> is to be understood either as without ceasing; or <q>by day</q> in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, <q>by night</q> in tribulations. For it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saw my day, and was glad:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180010"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;8:5-6</a></span> and of tribulation it is said, <q>my reins also have instructed me, even unto the night.</q> </p>

<p>3. <q>And he shall be like a tree planted hard by the running streams of waters</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse3">Psalm 1:3</a></span>; that is either Very <q>Wisdom,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180012"><a href="../bible/pro008.htm">Proverbs&nbsp;viii</a></span> which vouchsafed to assume man's nature for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; that as man He might be <q>the tree planted hard by the running streams of waters;</q> for in this sense can that too be taken which is said in another Psalm, <q>the river of God is full of water.</q>  Or by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, of whom it is said, <q>He shall <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180014"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span> and again, <q>If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180015"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37</a></span> and again, <q>If you knew the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who it is that asks water of you, you would have asked of Him, and He would have given you living water, of which whoso drinks shall never thirst, but it shall be made in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</q>  Or, <q>by the running streams of waters</q> may be by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the people, because first the waters are called <q>peoples</q> in the Apocalypse; <span class="stiki" id="note180017"><a href="../bible/rev017.htm#verse15">Revelation&nbsp;17:15</a></span> and again, by <q>running stream</q> is not unreasonably understood <q>fall,</q> which has relation to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. That <q>tree</q> then, that is, our Lord, from the running streams of water, that is, from the sinful people's drawing them by the way into the roots of His discipline, will <q>bring forth fruit,</q> that is, will establish Churches; <q>in His season,</q> that is, after He has been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by His Resurrection and Ascension into heaven. For then, by the sending of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to the Apostles, and by the confirming of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him, and their mission to the world, He made the Churches to <q>bring forth fruit.</q> <q>His leaf also shall not fall,</q> that is, His Word shall not be in vain. For, <q>all flesh is grass, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of man as the flower of grass; the grass withers,  and the flower falls, but the word of the Lord abides for ever. <span class="stiki" id="note180018"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;40:6-8</a></span> And whatsoever He does shall prosper</q> that is, whatsoever that tree shall bear; which all must be taken of fruit and leaves, that is, <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words.</p>

<p>4. <q>The ungodly are not so,</q> they are not so, <q>but are like the dust which the wind casts forth from the face of the earth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse4">Psalm 1:4</a></span>. <q>The earth</q> is here to be taken as that steadfastness in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with a view to which it is said, <q>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, yea, I have a goodly heritage.</q>  With a view to this it is said, <q>Wait on the Lord and keep His ways, and He shall exalt you to inherit the earth.</q>  With a view to this it is said, <q>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180021"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;5:5</a></span> A comparison too is derived hence, for as this visible earth supports and contains the outer man, so that earth invisible the inner man. <q>From the face of</q> which <q>earth the wind casts forth the ungodly,</q> that is, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, in that it puffs him up. On his guard against which he, who was inebriated by the richness of the house of the Lord, and drunken of the torrent stream of its pleasures, says, <q>Let not the foot of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> come against me.</q>  From this earth <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> cast forth him who said, <q>I will place my seat in the north, and I will be like the Most High.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180023"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;14:13-14</a></span> From the face of the earth it cast forth him also who, after that he had consented and tasted of the forbidden tree that he might be as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hid himself from the Face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note180024"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;3:8</a></span> That his earth has reference to the inner man, and that man  is cast forth thence by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, may be particularly seen in that which is written, <q>Why is earth and ashes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>? Because, in his life, he cast forth his bowels.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180026"><a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse9">Sirach&nbsp;10:9</a></span> For, whence he has been cast forth, he is not unreasonably said to have cast forth himself.</p>

<p>5. <q>Therefore the ungodly rise not in the judgment</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse5">Psalm 1:5</a></span>: <q>therefore,</q> namely, because <q>as dust they are cast forth from the face of the earth.</q> And well did he say that this should be taken away from them, which in their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> they court, namely, that they may judge; so that this same idea is more clearly expressed in the following sentence, <q>nor sinners in the counsel of the righteous.</q> For it is usual for what goes before,  to be thus repeated more clearly. So that by <q>sinners</q> should be understood the <q>ungodly;</q> what is before <q>in the judgment,</q> should be here <q>in the counsel of the righteous.</q> Or if indeed the ungodly are one thing, and sinners another, so that although every ungodly man is a sinner, yet every sinner is not ungodly; <q>The ungodly rise not in the judgment,</q> that is, they shall rise indeed, but not that they should be judged, for they are already appointed to most certain punishment. But <q>sinners</q> do not rise <q>in counsel of the just,</q> that is, that they may judge, but perhaps that they may be judged; so as of these it were said, <q>The fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work abide, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall then suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</q></p>

<p>6. <q>For the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the way of the righteous</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa001.htm#verse6">Psalm 1:6</a></span>. As it is said, medicine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> health, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not disease, and yet disease is recognised by the art of medicine. In like manner can it be said that <q>the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the way of the righteous,</q> but the way of the ungodly He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not. Not that the Lord is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of anything, and yet He says to sinners, <q>I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180028"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;7:23</a></span> <q>But the way of the ungodly shall perish;</q> is the same as if it were said, the way of the ungodly the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not. But it is expressed more plainly that this should be not to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the Lord, namely, to <q>perish;</q> and this to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of the Lord, namely, to <q>abide;</q> so as that to be should appertain to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to His not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> not to be. For the Lord says, <q>I Am that I Am,</q> and, <q>I Am has sent me.</q> </p>
