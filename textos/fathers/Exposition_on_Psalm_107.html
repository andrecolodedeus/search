<h1>Exposition on Psalm 107</h1>


<p>1. This Psalm commends unto us the mercies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in ourselves, and is therefore the sweeter to the experienced. And it is a wonder if it can be pleasing to any one, except to him who has learned in his own case, what he hears in this Psalm. Yet was it written not for any one or two, but for the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and set forth that it might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> itself therein as in a mirror. Its title needs not now to be treated, for it is Halleluia, and again Halleluia. Which we have a custom of singing at a certain time in our solemnities, after an old tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: nor is it without a sacred meaning that we sing it on particular days.  Halleluia we sing indeed on certain days,  but every day we think it. For if in this word is signified the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though not in the mouth of the flesh, yet surely in the mouth of the heart. <q>His praise shall ever be in my mouth.</q>  But that the title has Halleluia not once only but twice, is not peculiar to this Psalm, but the former also has it so. And as far as appears from its text, that was sung of the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but this is sung of the universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, spread through the whole world. Perchance, it not unfitly has Halleluia twice, because we cry, Abba, Father. Since Abba is nothing else but Father, yet not without meaning the Apostle said, <q>in whom we cry, Abba, Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184875"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;8:15</a></span> but because one wall indeed coming to the Corner Stone cries Abba, but the other, from the other side cries Father; viz., in that Corner Stone, <q>who is our Peace, who has made both one.</q>...</p>

<p>2. <q>Confess unto the Lord that He is sweet, because for aye in His mercy</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse1">Psalm 106:1</a></span>. This confess ye that He is sweet: if you have tasted, confess. But he cannot confess, who has not chosen to taste, for whence shall he say that that is sweet, which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not. But ye if you have tasted how sweet the Lord is, <span class="stiki" id="note184876"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:3</a></span> <q>Confess ye to the Lord that He is sweet.</q> If you have tasted with eagerness, break forth  with confession. <q>For aye is His mercy,</q> that is, for ever. For here <q>for aye,</q> is so put, since also in some other places of Scripture, for aye, that is, what in Greek is called <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2; &#x03B1;&#x1F30;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;</span>, is understood for ever. For His mercy is not for a time, so as not to be for ever, since for this purpose His present mercy is over men, that they may live with the Angels for ever.</p>

<p>3. <q>Let them say who are redeemed of the Lord, whom He has redeemed from the hand of their enemies</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse2">Psalm 106:2</a></span>. Redeemed indeed it seems was also the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from the hand of slavery, from fruitless labours, from miry works; yet let us see whether those who say these things, are they who were freed by the Lord from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. It is not so. But who are they? <q>Those whom He redeemed.</q> Still one might take it also of them, as redeemed from the hand of their enemies, that is, of the Egyptians. Let them be expressed exactly who they are, for whom this Psalm would be sung. <q>He gathered them from the lands;</q> these might still be the lands of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, for there are many lands even in one province. Let him speak openly. <q>From the east and the west, from the north and the sea</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse3">Psalm 106:3</a></span>. Now then we understand these redeemed, in the whole circle of the earth. This people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, freed from a great and broad <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, is led, as through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note184878"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;14:22</a></span> that in Baptism it may make an end of its enemies. For by the sacrament as it were of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, that is by Baptism <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with the Blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the pursuing Egyptians, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, are washed away....<q>But all these things happened to them in a figure, and were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184879"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:11</a></span> ...</p>

<p>4. <q>They wandered in the wilderness, in a dry place, they found not the way of a city to dwell in</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse4">Psalm 106:4</a></span>. We have heard a wretched wandering; what of want? <q>Hungry and thirsty, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> fainted in them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse5">Psalm 106:5</a></span>. But wherefore did it faint? For what good? For God is not cruel, but He makes Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, in that it is expedient for us, that He be entreated by us fainting, and that aiding us He be loved. And therefore after this wandering, and hunger, and thirst, <q>And they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distress</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse6">Psalm 106:6</a></span>. And what did He for them, as they were wandering? <q>And He led them in the right way</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse7">Psalm 106:7</a></span>. They found not the way of a city to dwell in, with hunger and thirst they were vexed and faint, <q>and He led them into the right way, that they might go into a city to dwell in.</q> How He helped their hunger and thirst, He says not, but even this expect ye: <q>Let them confess unto the Lord His mercies, and His wonders towards the children of men</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse8">Psalm 106:8</a></span>. Tell them, you that are experienced, to the inexperienced; ye that are already in the way, already directed towards finding the city, already at last free from hunger and thirst. <q>Because He has satisfied the empty <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and filled the hungry <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse9">Psalm 106:9</a></span>.</p>

<p>5. <q>Them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, fast bound in beggary and iron</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse10">Psalm 106:10</a></span>. Whence this, but that you were attributing things to yourself? That you were not owning the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God? That you were rejecting the counsel of God <span class="stiki" id="note184880"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;7:30</a></span> concerning you? For see what He adds: <q>Because they rebelled against the words of the Lord through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse11">Psalm 106:11</a></span>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wishing to establish their own, <span class="stiki" id="note184881"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3</a></span> <q>and they were bitter against the counsel of the Most High.</q> <q>And their heart was brought low in labour</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse12">Psalm 106:12</a></span>. And now fight against <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; if God cease to aid you may strive, you can not conquer. And when you shall be pressed by your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, your heart will be brought low in labour, so that now with humbled heart you may learn to cry out, <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184882"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> ...Freed, you will confess the mercies of the Lord. <q>And they cried unto the Lord when they were troubled, and He delivered them out of their distresses</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse13">Psalm 106:13</a></span>. They were freed from the second <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. There remains that of weariness and loathing. But first see what He did for them when freed. <q>And He led them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and broke their bonds asunder</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse14">Psalm 106:14</a></span>. <q>Let them confess to the Lord His mercies, and His wonders to the children of men</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse15">Psalm 106:15</a></span>. Wherefore? What difficulties has He overcome? <q>Because He broke the gates of brass, and snapped the bars of iron</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse16">Psalm 106:16</a></span>. <q>He took them up from the way of their iniquity, for because of their unrighteousnesses they were brought low</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse17">Psalm 106:17</a></span>. Because they gave <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to themselves, not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they were establishing their own righteousness, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note184883"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3</a></span> they were brought low. They found that they were helpless without His aid, who were presuming on their own strength alone.</p>

<p>6. <q>Their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> abhorred all manner of meat</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse18">Psalm 106:18</a></span>. Now they suffer satiety. They are sick of satiety. They are in danger from satiety. Unless perchance you think they could be killed with famine, but cannot with satiety. See what follows. When he had said, <q>Their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> abhorred all manner of meat,</q> lest you should think them, as it were, safe of their fullness, and not rather see that they would die of satiety: <q>And they came near,</q> he says, <q>even unto the gates of death.</q> What then remains? That even when the word of God delights you, thou account it not to yourself; nor for this be puffed up with any sort of arrogance, and having an appetite for food, proudly spurn at those who are in danger from satiety. <q>And they cried out unto the Lord when they were in trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse19">Psalm 106:19</a></span>. And because it was a sickness not to be pleased, <q>He sent His Word, and healed them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse20">Psalm 106:20</a></span>. See what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> there is in satiety; see whence He delivers, to whom he cries that loathes his food. <q>He sent His Word, and healed them, and snatched them,</q> from whence? Not from wandering, not from hunger, not from the difficulty of overcoming <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but <q>from their corruption.</q> It is a sort of corruption of the mind to loathe what is sweet. Therefore also of this benefit, as of the others before, <q>Let them confess to the Lord His mercies, and His wonders unto the sons of men</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse21">Psalm 106:21</a></span>. <q>And <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse22">Psalm 106:22</a></span>. For now that He may be praised, the Lord is sweet, <q>and let them tell out His works with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>.</q> Not with weariness, not with sadness, not with anxiety, not with loathing, but <q>with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>.</q></p>

<p>7. ...<q>They who go down on the sea in ships, doing their business on the mighty waters</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse23">Psalm 106:23</a></span>; that is, among many peoples. For that waters are often put for peoples, the Apocalypse of John is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, when on John's asking what those waters were, it was answered him, they are peoples. They then who do their business on mighty waters, <q>they have seen the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse24">Psalm 106:24</a></span>. For what is deeper than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hearts? Hence often break forth winds; storms of sedition, and dissensions, disturb the ship. And what is done in them? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, willing that both they who steer, and they who are conveyed, should cry unto Him, <q>He spoke, and the breath of the storm stood</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse25">Psalm 106:25</a></span>. What is, stood? Abode, continued, still disturbs, long tosses; rages, and passes not away. <q>For He spoke, and the breath of the storm stood.</q> And what did that breath of the storm? <q>They go up even to the heavens,</q> in daring; <q>They go down even into the deeps</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse26">Psalm 106:26</a></span>, in fearing. <q>Their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> wasted in miseries.</q> <q>They were disturbed, and moved like a drunken man</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse27">Psalm 106:27</a></span>. They who sit at the helm, and they who faithfully <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the ship, feel what I say. Certainly, when they speak, when they read, when they interpret, they appear wise. Woe for the storm! <q>and all their wisdom,</q> he says, <q>was swallowed up.</q> Sometimes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> counsels fail; whichever way one turns himself, the waves roar, the storm rages, the arms are powerless: where the prow may strike, to what wave the side may be exposed, whither the stricken ship may be allowed to drift, from what rocks she must be kept back lest she be lost, is impossible for her pilots to see. And what is left but that which follows? <q>And they cried out unto the Lord when they were troubled, and He delivered them from their distresses</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse28">Psalm 106:28</a></span>. <q>And He commanded the storm, and it stood unto clear air</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse29">Psalm 106:29</a></span>, <q>and the waves of it were still.</q> Hear on this point the voice of a steersman, one that was in peril, was brought low, was freed. <q>I would not,</q> he says, have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, of our distress, which befell us in Asia, that <q>we were pressed above strength, and above measure</q> (I see all his <q>wisdom swallowed up</q>), <q>so that we were weary,</q> he says, <q>even of life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184884"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:8</a></span> ...</p>

<p><q>And they were glad, because they were still, and He brought them into the haven of their desire</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse30">Psalm 106:30</a></span>. <q>Let His mercies confess unto the Lord, and His wonders towards the sons of men</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse31">Psalm 106:31</a></span>. Everywhere, without exception, let not our merits, not our strength, not our wisdom, <q>confess unto the Lord,</q> but, <q>His mercies.</q> Let Him be loved in every deliverance of ours, who has been invoked in every distress.</p>

<p>8. <q>And let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people, and praise Him in the seat of the elders</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse32">Psalm 106:32</a></span>. Let them exalt, let them praise, peoples and elders, merchants and pilots. For what has He done in this assembly? What has He established? Whence has He rescued it? What has He granted it? Even as He resisted the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and gave <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note184885"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James&nbsp;4:6</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, that is, the first people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, arrogant, and extolling itself on its descent from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and because to that nation <q>were entrusted the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184886"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;3:2</a></span> These things did not avail them unto soundness, but unto <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of heart, rather to swelling than to greatness. What then did <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, resisting the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but giving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>; cutting off the natural branches for their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; grafting in the wild olive for its humility?</p>

<p><q>He made the rivers a wilderness</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse33">Psalm 106:33</a></span>. Waters did run there, prophecies were in course. Seek now a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; you find none. For <q>He made the outgoings of waters to be thirst.</q> Let them say, <q>Now there is no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> more, and He will not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> us any more.</q>  <q>A fruitful land to be saltpools</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse34">Psalm 106:34</a></span>. You seek there the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you find not: you seek a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, you find not: you seek a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, you find not: you seek a temple, you find none. Wherefore this? <q>From the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of them that dwell therein.</q> Behold how He resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>: hear how He gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. <q>He made the wilderness to be a standing water, and the dry ground to be outgoings of waters</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse35">Psalm 106:35</a></span>. <q>And He caused the hungry to dwell there</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse36">Psalm 106:36</a></span>. Because to Him it was said, <q>You are a Priest for ever, after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedec</a>.</q>  For you seek a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; you have none after the order of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>. You seek it after the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedec</a>; you find it not among them, but through the whole world it is celebrated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <q>From the rising of the sun to the setting thereof the name of the Lord is praised.</q>. ..<q>And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards, and gat fruit of grain</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse37">Psalm 106:37</a></span>: at which that workman rejoices, who says, <q>Not because I desire a gift, but I seek fruit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184890"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse17">Philippians&nbsp;4:17</a></span> <q>And He blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly, and their cattle were not diminished</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse38">Psalm 106:38</a></span>. This stands. For <q>the foundation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stands sure; because the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184891"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:19</a></span> They are called <q>beasts of burden,</q> and <q>cattle,</q> that walk simply in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, yet are useful; not much learned, but full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore, whether spiritual or carnal, <q>He blessed them.</q></p>

<p>9. <q>And they became few, and were vexed</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse39">Psalm 106:39</a></span>. Whence this? From athwart? Nay, from within. For that they should <q>become few,</q> <q>They went out from us, but they were not of us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184892"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> But therefore he speaks as of these, of whom he spoke before, that they may be discerned with understanding; because he speaks as if of the same, because of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> they have in common. For they belong to the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though not by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, yet surely by the appearance of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>: for concerning them we have heard the Apostle, <q>In the last times there shall come grievous times, for there shall be men lovers of themselves.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184893"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:2</a></span> The first <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is, <q>lovers of themselves;</q> that is, as being pleased with themselves. Would that they were not pleasing to themselves, and were pleasing to God: would that they would cry out in their difficulties, and be freed from their distresses. But while they presumed greatly on themselves, <q>they were made few.</q> It is manifest, brethren: all who separate themselves from unity become few. For they are many; but in unity, while they are not parted from unity. For when the multitude of unity has begun no more to belong to them, in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, they are few. <q>And they were vexed, from distress of miseries and grief.</q> <q>Contempt was poured on princes</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse40">Psalm 106:40</a></span>. For they were rejected by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, and the more because they wished to be princes, therefore they were despised, and became <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> that had lost its savour, cast out abroad, so that it is trodden under foot of men. <span class="stiki" id="note184894"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;5:13</a></span> <q>And He led them astray in the pathless place, and not in a way.</q> Those above in the way, those directed to a city, and finally led there, not led astray; but these, where there was no way, led astray. What is, <q>Led them astray</q>? God <q>gave them up to their own hearts' <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184895"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;1:24</a></span> For <q>led astray</q> means this, gave them up to themselves. For if you enquire closely, it is they that lead themselves astray....<q>And He helped the poor out of beggary</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse41">Psalm 106:41</a></span>. What means this, brethren? Princes are despised, and the poor helped. The <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> are cast aside, and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> provided for....<q>And made him households like sheep.</q> Thou understandest one poor man and one beggar of him concerning whom he said, <q>He has helped the poor out of misery:</q> this poor man is now many households, this poor man is many nations; many Churches are one Church, one nation, one household, one sheep. These are great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, great types, how profound, how full of hidden meanings; how sweetly discovered, since long hidden. Therefore, <q>the righteous will consider this, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>: and the mouth of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> shall be stopped</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse42">Psalm 106:42</a></span>. That <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> that does prate against unity, and compels <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be made manifest, shall be convicted, and have its mouth stopped.</p>

<p>10. <q>Who is wise? And he will consider these things; and will understand the mercies of the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa106.htm#verse43">Psalm 106:43</a></span>....Not his own deservings, not his own strength, not his own power; but <q>the mercies of the Lord;</q> who, when he was wandering and in want, led him back to the path, and fed him; who, when he was struggling against the difficulties of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and bound down with the fetters of habit, released and freed him; who, when he loathed the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and was almost dying with a kind of weariness, restored him by sending him the medicine of His Word; who, when he was endangered among the risks of shipwreck and storm, stilled the sea, and brought him into port; who, finally, placed him in that people, where He gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>; not in that where he resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>; and has made him His own, that remaining within he may be multiplied, not that going out he may be minished. The righteous see this, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. <q>The mouth,</q> therefore, <q>of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> shall be stopped.</q></p>
