<h1>Exposition on Psalm 11</h1>


<p> <em>To the end, a psalm of David himself.</em> </p>

<p>1. This title does not require a fresh consideration: for the meaning of, <q>to the end,</q> has already been sufficiently handled.  Let us then look to the text itself of the Psalm, which to me appears to be sung against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,  who, by rehearsing and exaggerating the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of many in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as if either all or the majority among themselves were righteous, strive to turn and snatch us away from the breasts of the one True Mother Church: affirming that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is with them, and warning us as if with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and earnestness, that by passing over to them we may go over to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom they <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> declare they have. Now it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, among the many names in which notice of Him is conveyed in allegory, is also called a mountain.  We must accordingly answer these people, and say, <q>I trust in the Lord: how say ye to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, Remove into the mountains as a sparrow?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse1">Psalm 10:1</a></span>. I keep to one mountain wherein I trust, how say ye that I should pass over to you, as if there were many Christs? Or if through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> you say that you are mountains, I had indeed need to be a sparrow winged with the powers and commandments of God: but these very things hinder my flying to these mountains, and placing my trust in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> men. I have a house where I may rest, in that I trust in the Lord. For even <q>the sparrow has found her a house,</q>  and, <q>The Lord has become a refuge to the poor.</q>  Let us say then with all confidence, lest while we seek Christ among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> we lose Him, <q>In the Lord I trust: how say ye to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, Remove into the mountains as a sparrow?</q></p>

<p>2. <q>For, lo, sinners have bent the bow, they have prepared their arrows in the quiver, that they may in the obscure moon shoot at the upright in heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse2">Psalm 10:2</a></span>. These be the terrors of those who threaten us as touching sinners, that we may pass over to them as the righteous. <q>Lo,</q> they say, <q>the sinners have bent the bow:</q> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, I suppose, by carnal interpretation of which they emit envenomed sentences from them. <q>They have prepared their arrows in the quiver:</q> the same words, that is, which they will shoot out on the authority of Scripture, they have prepared in the secret place of the heart. <q>That they may in the obscure moon  shoot at the upright in heart:</q> that when they see, from the Church's light being obscured by the multitude of the unlearned and the carnal, that they cannot be convicted, they may corrupt good manners by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications. <span class="stiki" id="note180417"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:33</a></span> But against all these terrors we must say, <q>In the Lord I trust.</q></p>

<p>3. Now I remember that I promised to consider in this Psalm with what suitableness the moon signifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  There are two probable opinions concerning the moon: but of these which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, I suppose it either impossible or very difficult for a man to decide. For when we ask whence the moon has her light, some say that it is her own, but that of her globe half is bright, and half dark: and when she revolves in her own orbit, that part wherein she is bright gradually turns towards the earth, so as that it may be seen by us; and that therefore at first her appearance is as if she were horned....According to this opinion the moon in allegory signifies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because in its spiritual part the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is bright, but in its carnal part is dark: and sometimes the spiritual part is seen by good works, but sometimes it lies hid in the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to God alone, since in the body alone is it seen by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>....But according to the other opinion also the moon is understood to be the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because she has no light of her own, but is lighted by the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who in many places of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture is allegorically called the Sun.  Whom certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>  being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, and not able to discern Him, endeavour to turn away the minds of the simple to this corporeal and visible sun, which is the common light of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and flies, and some they do pervert, who as long as they cannot behold with the mind the inner light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, will not be content with the simple <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; which is the only safety to babes, and by which milk alone they can arrive in assured strength at the firm support of more solid food. Whichever then of these two opinions be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the moon in allegory is fitly understood as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Or if in such difficulties as these, troublesome rather than edifying, there be either no satisfaction or no leisure to exercise the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or if the mind itself be not capable of it, it is sufficient to regard the moon with ordinary  eyes, and not to seek out obscure causes, but with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to perceive her increasings and fulnesses and wanings; and if she wanes to the end that she may be renewed, even to this rude multitude she sets forth the image of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in which the resurrection of the dead is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>4. Next we must enquire, what in this Psalm is meant by <q>the obscure moon,</q> in which sinners have prepared to shoot at the upright in heart? For not in one way only may the moon be said to be obscure: for when her monthly course is finished, and when her brightness is interrupted by a cloud, and when she is eclipsed at the full, the moon may be called obscure. It may then be understood first of the persecutors of the Martyrs, for that they wished in the obscure moon to shoot at the upright in heart; whether it be yet in the time of the Church's youth, because she had not yet shone forth in greatness on the earth, and conquered the darkness of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a>; or by the tongues of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> and such as defame the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, when the earth was as it were beclouded, the moon, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, could not be clearly seen; or when by the slaughter of the Martyrs themselves and so great effusion of blood, as by that eclipse and obscuration, wherein the moon seems to exhibit a bloody face, the weak were deterred from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name; in which terror sinners shot out words crafty and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> to pervert even the upright in heart. And secondly, it can be understood of these sinners, whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> contains, because at that time, taking the opportunity of this moon's obscurity, they committed many crimes, which are now tauntingly objected to us by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, whereas their founders are said to have been guilty of them.  But howsoever that be which was done in the obscure moon, now that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> name is spread and celebrated throughout the whole world, what concern of mine is it to be disturbed by things unknown? For <q>in the Lord I trust;</q> nor do I listen to them that say to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <q>Remove into the mountains as a sparrow. For, lo, sinners have bent the bow, that they may in the obscure moon shoot at the upright in heart.</q> Or if the moon seem even  now obscure to them, because they would make it uncertain which is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and they strive to convict her by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those many carnal men whom she contains; what concern is this to him, who says in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <q>In the Lord I trust</q>? By which word every one shows that he is himself wheat, and endures the chaff with patience unto the time of winnowing.</p>

<p>5. <q>In the Lord,</q> therefore, <q>I trust.</q> Let them <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> who trust in man, and cannot deny that they are of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> party, by whose grey hairs they <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>; and when in conversation it is demanded of them, of what communion they are, unless they say that they are of his party, they cannot be recognised....Or perhaps you will say that it is written, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by their works</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note180424"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;7:16</a></span> I see indeed marvellous works the daily violences of the Circumcelliones,  with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> for their leaders, flying about in every direction, and calling their terrible clubs <q>Israels;</q> which men now living daily see and feel. But for the times of Macarius,  respecting which they raise an invidious cry,  most men have not seen them, and no one sees them now: and any <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who saw them could say, if he wished to be a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>In the Lord I trust.</q>...</p>

<p>6. Let the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> then say, <q>In the Lord I trust; how say ye to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, Remove into the mountains as a sparrow? For, lo, the sinners have bent the bow, they have prepared their arrows in the quiver, that they may in the obscure moon shoot at the upright in heart:</q> and from them let her turn her speech to the Lord and say, <q>For they have destroyed what You have perfected</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse3">Psalm 10:3</a></span>. And this let her say not against these only, but against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For they have all, as far as in them lies, destroyed the praise which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has perfected out of the mouth of babes and sucklings,  when they disturb the little ones with vain and scrupulous questions, and suffer them not to be nourished with the milk of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. As if then it were said to this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, why do they say to you, <q>Remove into the mountains as a sparrow;</q> why do they frighten you with sinners, who <q>have bent the bow, to shoot in the obscure moon at the upright in heart</q>? She answers, Therefore it is they frighten me, <q>because they have destroyed what You have perfected.</q> Where but in their conventicles, where they nourish not with milk, but kill with poison the babes and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the interior light. <q>But what has the Just done?</q>  If Macarius, if C&aelig;cilianus, offend you, what has Christ done to you, who said, <q>My peace I give unto you, My peace I leave with you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180431"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;14:27</a></span> which you with your abominable dissensions have violated? What has Christ done to you? Who with such exceeding patience endured His betrayer, as to give to him, as to the other Apostles, the first <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>  with His own hands, and blessed with His own mouth.  What has Christ done to you? Who sent this same betrayer, whom He called a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note180434"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse70">John&nbsp;6:70</a></span> who before betraying the Lord could not show good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even to the Lord's purse, <span class="stiki" id="note180435"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;12:6</a></span> with the other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to preach the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note180436"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;10:5-7</a></span> that He might show that the gifts of God come to those that with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> receive them, though he, through whom they receive them, be such as Judas was.</p>

<p>7. <q>The Lord is in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse4">Psalm 10:4</a></span>, yea in such wise as the Apostle says, <q>For the temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, which</q> temple <q>you are.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180437"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> <q>Now if any man shall violate the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him shall God destroy.</q> He violates the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who violates unity: for he <q>holds not the head, from which the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies  according to the working after the measure of every part makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q>  The Lord is in this His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple; which consists of His many members, fulfilling each his own separate duties, by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> built up into one building. Which temple he violates, who for the sake of his own pre-eminence separates himself from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> society. <q>The Lord is in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple; the Lord, His seat is in heaven.</q> If you take heaven to be the just man, as you take the earth to be the sinner, to whom it was said, <q>Earth you are, and unto earth shall you go;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180440"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> the words, <q>The Lord is in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple</q> you will understand to be repeated, while it is said, <q>The Lord, His seat is in heaven.</q></p>

<p>8. <q>His eyes look upon the poor.</q>  His to Whom the poor man has been left, and Who has been made a refuge to the poor.  And therefore all the seditions and tumults within these nets, <span class="stiki" id="note180443"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse47">Matthew&nbsp;13:47</a></span> until they be drawn to shore, concerning which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> upbraid us to their own ruin and our correction, are caused by those men, who will not be Christ's poor. But do they turn away God's eyes from such as would be so? <q>For His eyes look upon the poor.</q> Is it to be feared lest, in the crowd of the rich, He may not be able to see the few poor, whom He brings up in safe keeping in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? <q>His eyelids question the sons of men.</q> Here by that rule I would wish to take <q>the sons of men</q>  of those that from old men have been regenerated by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For these, by certain obscure passages of Scripture, as it were the closed eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are exercised that they may seek: and again, by certain clear passages, as it were the open eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are enlightened that they may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. And this frequent closing and opening in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Books are as it were the eyelids of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which question, that is, which try the <q>sons of men;</q> who are neither wearied with the obscurity of the matter, but exercised; nor puffed up by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but confirmed.</p>

<p>9. <q>The Lord questions the righteous and ungodly</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse5">Psalm 10:5</a></span>. Why then do we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the ungodly should be any hurt to us, if so be they do with insincere heart share the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> with us, seeing that He <q>questions the righteous and the ungodly.</q> <q>But whoso loves iniquity, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>:</q> that is, not him who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and puts not his hope in man, but only his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does the lover of iniquity hurt.</p>

<p>10. <q>He shall rain snares upon the sinners</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse6">Psalm 10:6</a></span>. If by clouds are understood <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> generally, whether good or bad, who are also called <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>: <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> are so ordered by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, that by them He may rain snares upon sinners. <span class="stiki" id="note180445"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;24:24</a></span> For no one, but the sinner, falls into a following of them, whether by way of preparation for the last punishment, if he shall choose to persevere in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; or to dissuade from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, if in time he shall come to seek God with a more sincere intent. But if by clouds are understood good and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> only; by these too it is clear that God rains snares upon sinners, although by them He waters also the godly unto fruitfulness. <q>To some,</q> says the Apostle, <q>we are the savour of life unto life; to some the savour of death unto death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180446"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:16</a></span> For not <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> only, but all who with the word of God water <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, may be called clouds. Who when they are understood amiss, God rains snares upon sinners; but when they are understood aright, He makes the hearts of the godly and believing fruitful. As, for instance, the passage, <q>and they two shall be in one flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180447"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse31">Ephesians&nbsp;5:31</a></span> if one interpret it with an eye to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, He rains a snare upon the sinner. But if you understand it, as he who says, <q>But I speak concerning Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180448"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians&nbsp;5:32</a></span> He rains a shower on the fertile soil. Now both are effected by the same cloud, that is, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture. Again the Lord says, <q>Not that which goes into your mouth defiles you, but that which comes out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180449"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;15:11</a></span> The sinner hears this, and makes ready his palate for <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>: the righteous hears it, and is guarded against the superstitious distinction in meats. Here then also out of the same cloud of Scripture, according to the several desert of each, upon the sinner the rain of snares, upon the righteous the rain of fruitfulness, is poured.</p>

<p>11. <q>Fire and brimstone and the blast of the tempest is the portion of their cup.</q> This is their punishment and end, by whom the name of God is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>; that first they should be wasted by the fire of their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, then by the ill savour of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> cast off from the company of the blessed, at last carried away and overwhelmed suffer penalties unspeakable. For this is the portion of their cup: as of the righteous, <q>Your cup inebriating how excellent is it! For they shall be inebriated with the richness of Your house.</q>  Now I suppose a cup is mentioned for this reason, that we should not suppose that anything is done by God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>, even in the very punishments of sinners, beyond moderation and measure. And therefore as if he were giving a reason why this should be, he added, <q>For the Lord is righteous, and has loved righteousnesses</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa010.htm#verse7">Psalm 10:7</a></span>. The plural not without meaning, but only because he speaks of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, is as that righteousnesses be understood to be used for righteous men. For in many righteous men there seem, so to say, to be righteousnesses, whereas there is one only righteousness of God whereof they all participate. Like as when one face looks upon many mirrors, what in it is one only, is by those many mirrors reflected manifoldly. Wherefore he recurs to the singular, saying, <q>His face has seen equity.</q> Perhaps, <q>His face has seen equity,</q> is as if it were said, Equity has been seen in His face, that is, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him. For God's face is the power by which He is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them that are worthy. Or at least, <q>His face has seen equity,</q> because He does not allow Himself to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but by the good; and this is equity.</p>

<p>12. But if any one would understand the moon of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, let him refer the Psalm to the Lord's passion, and of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say, <q>For they have destroyed what You have perfected;</q>  and of the Lord Himself, <q>But what has the Just done?</q> whom they accused as the destroyer of the Law: whose precepts, by their corrupt living, and by despising them, and by setting up their own, they had destroyed, so that the Lord Himself may speak as Man, as He is wont, saying, <q>In the Lord I trust; how say ye to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, Remove into the mountains as a sparrow?</q>  by reason, that is, of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of those who desire to apprehend and crucify Him. Since the interpretation is not unreasonable of sinners wishing to <q>shoot at the upright in heart,</q>  that is, those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>in the obscure moon,</q> that is, the Synagogue filled with sinners. To this too the words, <q>The Lord is in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple; the Lord, His seat is in heaven,</q>  are suitable; that is, the Word in Man, or the very <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> who is in heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note180455"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;3:13</a></span> <q>His eyes look upon the poor;</q> either on to Him whom He assumed as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or for whom He suffered as Man. <q>His eyelids question the sons of men.</q> The closing and opening of the eyes, which is probably meant by the word eyelids, we may take to be His death and resurrection, whereby He tried the sons of men His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, terrified at His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, and gladdened by the resurrection. <q>The Lord questions the righteous and ungodly,</q>  even now from out of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> governing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <q>But whoso loves iniquity, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> Why it is so, what follows teaches us. For <q>He shall rain snares upon the sinners:</q>  which is to be taken according to the exposition above given, and so on with all the rest to the end of the Psalm.</p>
