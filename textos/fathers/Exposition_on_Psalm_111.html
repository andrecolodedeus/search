<h1>Exposition on Psalm 111</h1>


<p>1. The days have come for us to sing Allelujah.. ..Now these days come only to pass away, and pass away to come, again, and typify the day which does not come and pass away, because it is neither preceded by yesterday to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it to come, nor pressed upon by the morrow to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it to pass....For as these days succeed in regular season, with a joyful cheerfulness, the past days of Lent, whereby the misery of this life before the Resurrection of the Lord's body is signified; so that day which after the Resurrection shall be given to the full body of the Lord, that is, to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, when all the troubles and sorrows of this life have been shut out, shall succeed with perpetual bliss. But this life demands from us self-restraint, that although groaning and weighed down with our toil and struggles, and desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note184984"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> we may refrain from secular pleasures: and this is signified by the number of forty, which was the period of the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and Elias,  and our Lord Himself....But by the number fifty after our Lord's resurrection, during which season we sing Allelujah, not the term and passing away of a certain season is signified, but that blessed <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; because the <em>denary</em> <span class="stiki" id="note184986"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;20:10</a></span> added to forty signifies the reward paid to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who toil in this life, which our Father has prepared an equal share of for the first and for the last. Let us therefore hear the heart of the people of God full of divine praises. He represents in this Psalm some one exulting in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> joyfulness, he prefigures the people whose hearts are overflowing with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, freed from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>2. <q>I will make confession unto You, O Lord,</q> he says, <q>with my whole heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse1">Psalm 110:1</a></span>. Confession is not always confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but the praise of God is poured forth in the devotion of confession. The former mourns, the latter rejoices: the former shows the wound to the physician, the latter gives thanks for health. The latter confession signifies some one, not merely freed from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but even separate from all the ill-disposed. And for this reason let us consider the place where he confesses unto the Lord with all his heart. <q>In the counsel,</q> he says, <q>of the upright, and in the congregation:</q> I suppose, of those who shall <q>sit upon the twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184987"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;19:28</a></span> For there will be no longer an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> man among them, the thefts of no Judas are allowed, no <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, wishing to buy the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, while he designs to sell it;  no coppersmith like Alexander does many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note184989"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:14</a></span> no man covered with sheep's clothing creeps in with feigned fraternity; such as those among whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must now groan, and such as she must then shut out, when all the righteous shall be gathered together.</p>

<p><q>These are the great works of the Lord, sought out unto all His wills</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse2">Psalm 110:2</a></span>: through which mercy forsakes none who confesses, no man's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is unpunished. <span class="stiki" id="note184990"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6</a></span> ...Let man choose for himself what he lists: the works of the Lord are not so constituted, that the creature, having free discretion allowed him, should transcend the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Creator, even though he act contrary to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. God wills not that you should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for He forbids it: yet if you have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> not that the man has done what he willed, and that has happened to God which He willed not. For as He would that man would not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, so would He spare the sinner, that he may return and live; He so wills finally to punish him who persists in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that the rebellious cannot escape the power of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Thus whatever choice you have made, the Almighty will not be at a loss to fulfil His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> concerning you.</p>

<p>3. <q>Confession and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are His work</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse3">Psalm 110:3</a></span>. What is a more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> deed than to justify the ungodly? But perhaps the work of man prevents that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that when he has confessed his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he deserves to be justified....This is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> work of the Lord: for he loves most, to whom most is forgiven. <span class="stiki" id="note184991"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;7:42-48</a></span> This is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> work of the Lord: for <q>where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, there did <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> much more abound.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184992"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> But perhaps a man would deserve justification from works. <q>Not,</q> says he, <q>of works, lest any man boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184993"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;2:9-10</a></span> For a man works not righteousness save he be justified: but by <q>believing on Him that justifies the ungodly,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184994"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> he begins with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; that good may not by preceding show what he has deserved, but by following what he has received....</p>

<p>4. <q>He has made His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> to be remembered</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse4">Psalm 110:4</a></span>: by abasing this man, exalting that. Reserving unusual <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> for a fit season, that thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, intent upon novelty, may remember them, although His daily <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> be greater. He created so many trees throughout the whole earth, and no one wonders: He dried up one with a word, and the hearts of mortals were thunderstruck. <span class="stiki" id="note184995"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;21:19-20</a></span> For that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, which has not through its frequency become common, will cling most firmly to the heart. But of what use were the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, save that He might be feared? What too would <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> profit, unless <q>the gracious and merciful Lord</q> gave <q>meat unto them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse5">Psalm 110:5</a></span>; meat that does not spoil, <q>bread that comes down from heaven,</q>  which He gave to no deservings of ours. For <q>Christ died for the ungodly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184997"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;5:6</a></span> No one then would give such food, save a gracious and merciful Lord. But if He gave so much to this life, if the sinner who was to be justified received the Word made flesh; what shall he receive when <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in a future world? For, <q>He shall ever be mindful of His covenant.</q> Nor has He who has given a pledge, given the whole.</p>

<p>5. <q>He shall show His people the power of His works</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse6">Psalm 110:6</a></span>. Let not the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, who have left all their possessions and have followed Him, be saddened; let them not be sorrowful and say, <q>Who then can be saved?</q> For <q>it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> For <q>with men these things are impossible, but with God all things are possible.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184998"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;19:24-26</a></span> <q>That He may give them the heritage of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>.</q> For they went to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and enjoined the rich of this world <q>not to be high-minded, nor to trust in uncertain riches, but in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184999"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:17</a></span> to whom that is easy which is difficult for men. For thus many were called, thus the heritage of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> has been occupied, thus it has happened, that even many who have not abandoned all their possessions in this life in order to follow Him, have despised even life itself for the sake of confessing His Name; and like camels humbling themselves to bear the burden of troubles, have entered as it were through a needle's eye, through the piercing straits of suffering. He has wrought these effects, unto whom all things are possible.</p>

<p>6. <q>The works of His hands are verity and judgment</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse7">Psalm 110:7</a></span>. Let verity be held by those who are judged here. Martyrs are here sentenced, and brought to the judgment-seat, that they may judge not only those by whom they have been judged, but even give judgment on <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note185000"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:3</a></span> against whom was their struggle here, even when they seemed to be judged by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Let not tribulation, distress, famine, nakedness, the sword, separate from Christ. For <q>all His commandments are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185001"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;8:35</a></span> He deceives not, He gives us what He promised. Yet we should not expect here what He promised; we should not hope for it: but <q>they stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and equity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse8">Psalm 110:8</a></span>. It is equitable and just that we should labour here and repose there; since <q>He sent redemption unto His people</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse9">Psalm 110:9</a></span>. But from what are they redeemed, save from the captivity of this pilgrimage? Let not therefore rest be sought, save in the heavenly country. God indeed gave the carnal <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> an earthly Jerusalem, <q>which is in bondage with her children:</q> but this is the Old Covenant, pertaining unto the old man. But they who there understood the figure, even then were heirs of the New Covenant; for <q>Jerusalem which is above is free, which is our everlasting mother in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185002"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse25">Galatians&nbsp;4:25-26</a></span> But that transitory promises were given in that <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the fact itself: however, <q>He has commended His covenant for ever.</q> But what, but the New? Whosoever dost wish to be heir of this, deceive not yourself, and think not of a land flowing with milk and honey, nor of pleasant farms, nor of gardens abounding in fruits and shade: desire not how to gain anything of this sort, such as the eye of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is wont to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> for. For since <q><a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185003"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:10</a></span> it must be cut off, that it may be consumed here; not be put off, that it may be satisfied there. First escape punishments, avoid <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; before you long for a God who promises, beware of one who threatens. For <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and reverend is His Name.</q></p>

<p>7. ...<q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord,</q> therefore, <q>is the beginning of wisdom.</q> <q>Understanding is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa110.htm#verse10">Psalm 110:10</a></span>. Who gainsays? But to understand, and not to do, is dangerous. It is <q>good,</q> therefore, <q>to those that do thereafter.</q> Nor let it lift up the mind unto <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; for, <q>the praise of Him,</q> the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of whom is the beginning of wisdom, <q>endures for ever:</q> and this will be the reward, this the end, this the everlasting station and abode. There are found the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> commandments, made fast for ever and ever; here is the very heritage of the New Covenant commanded for ever. <q>One thing,</q> he says, <q>I have desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.</q>  For, <q>blessed are they that dwell in the house</q> of the Lord: <q>they will be always praising</q>  Him; for <q>His praise endures for ever.</q></p>
