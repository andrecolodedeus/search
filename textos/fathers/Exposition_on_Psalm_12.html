<h1>Exposition on Psalm 12</h1>


<p>To the end, for the eighth, a psalm of David.</p>

<p>1. It has been said on the sixth Psalm,  that <q>the eighth</q> may be taken as the day of judgment. <q>For the eighth</q> may also be taken <q>for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> age;</q> for that after the time present, which is a cycle of seven days, it shall be given to the Saints.</p>

<p>2. <q>Save me, O Lord, for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> has failed;</q> that is, is not found: as we speak when we say, Corn fails, or, Money fails. <q>For the truths have been minished from among the sons of men</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse1">Psalm 11:1</a></span>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one, whereby <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are enlightened: but forasmuch as there are many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, there may be said in them to be many truths: as in mirrors there are seen many reflections from one face.</p>

<p>3. <q>He has talked vanity each man to his neighbour</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse2">Psalm 11:2</a></span>. By neighbour we must understand every man: for that there is no one with whom we should work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; <q>and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our neighbour works no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180460"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> <q>Deceitful lips, with a heart and a heart they have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.</q>  The repetition, <q>with a heart and a heart,</q> signifies a double heart.</p>

<p>4. <q>May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse3">Psalm 11:3</a></span>. He says <q>all,</q> that no one may suppose himself excepted: as the Apostle says, <q>Upon every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man that does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, of the Jew first, and of the Greek.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180462"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;2:9</a></span> <q>The tongue speaking great things:</q> the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> tongue.</p>

<p>5. <q>Who have said, We will magnify our tongue, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse4">Psalm 11:4</a></span>. Proud hypocrites are meant, putting confidence in their speech to deceive men, and not submitting themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>6. <q>Because of the wretchedness of the needy and the sighing of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, now I will arise, says the Lord</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse5">Psalm 11:5</a></span>. For so the Lord Himself in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> pitied His people, because they had no ruler, when they could well <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. Whence too it is said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>The harvest  is plenteous, but the labourers are few.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180464"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;9:37</a></span> But this must be taken as spoken in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who, because of the needy and the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, that is, who in need and poverty were lacking spiritual <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, vouchsafed to send His own Son. From thence begins His sermon on the mount to Matthew, where He says, <q>Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180465"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3</a></span> <q>I will place in <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> He does not say what He would place: but, <q>in <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,</q> must be understood as, in Christ; according to that, <q>For my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180466"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;2:30</a></span> And hence He is understood to have placed in Him what appertains to the taking away the wretchedness of the needy, and the comforting the sighing of the poor. <q>I will deal confidently in Him:</q> according to that in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>For He taught them as one having authority, and not as their <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180467"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;7:29</a></span> </p>

<p>7. <q>The words of the Lord</q> are <q>pure words</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse6">Psalm 11:6</a></span>. This is in the person of the Prophet himself, <q>The words of the Lord</q> are <q>pure words.</q> He says <q>pure,</q> without the alloy of pretence. For many preach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> impurely; <span class="stiki" id="note180468"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse16">Philippians&nbsp;1:16</a></span> for they sell it for the <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> of the advantages of this life. Of such the Apostle says, that they declared Christ not purely. <q>Silver tried by the fire for the earth.</q>  These words of the Lord by means of tribulations approved to sinners. <q>Purified seven times:</q> by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by godliness, by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by might, by counsel, by understanding, by wisdom. <span class="stiki" id="note180470"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;11:2</a></span> For seven steps also of beatitude there are, which the Lord goes over, according to Matthew, in the same sermon which He spoke on the Mount, <q>Blessed</q> are <q>the poor in spirit, blessed the meek, blessed they that mourn, blessed they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, blessed the merciful, blessed the pure in heart, blessed the peacemakers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180471"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3-9</a></span> Of which seven sentences, it may be observed how all that long sermon was spoken. For the eighth where it is said, <q>Blessed</q> are <q>they which suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for righteousness' sake,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180472"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;5:10</a></span> denotes the fire itself, whereby the silver is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> seven times. And at the termination of this sermon it is said, <q>For He taught them as one having authority, and not as their <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180473"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;7:29</a></span> Which refers to that which is said in this Psalm, <q>I deal confidently in Him.</q></p>

<p>8. <q>You, O Lord, shall preserve us, and keep us from this generation to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse7">Psalm 11:7</a></span>: here as needy and poor, there as <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and rich.</p>

<p>9. <q>The ungodly walk in a circle round about</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa011.htm#verse8">Psalm 11:8</a></span>: that is, in the desire of things temporal, which revolves as a wheel in a repeated circle of seven days; and therefore they do not arrive at the eighth, that is, at <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, for which this Psalm is entitled.  So too it is said by Solomon, <q>For the wise king is the winnower of the ungodly, and he brings on them the wheel of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.&mdash; After Your height You have multiplied the sons of men.</q>  For there is in temporal things too a multiplication, which turns away from the unity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hence <q>the corruptible body weighs down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the earthy tabernacle presses down the mind that muses upon many things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180476"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> But the righteous are multiplied <q>after the height of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> when <q>they shall go from strength to strength.</q> </p>
