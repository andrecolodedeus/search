<h1>Exposition on Psalm 126</h1>


<p>1. ...How man had come into captivity, let us ask the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>....For he says: <q>For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185493"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;7:14</a></span> Behold whence we became captives; because we were sold under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Who sold us? We ourselves, who consented to the seducer. We could sell ourselves; we could not redeem ourselves. We sold ourselves by consent of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we are redeemed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of righteousness. For innocent blood was given for us, that we might be redeemed. Whatsoever blood he shed in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> the righteous, what kind of blood did he shed? Righteous men's blood, indeed, he shed; they were Prophets, righteous men, our fathers, and Martyrs. Whose blood he shed, yet all coming of the offspring of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. One blood he shed of Him who was not justified,  but born righteous: by shedding that blood, he lost those whom he held. For they for whom innocent blood was given were redeemed, and, turned back from their captivity, they sing this Psalm.</p>

<p>2. <q>When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion, we became as those that are comforted</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa125.htm#verse1">Psalm 125:1</a></span>. He meant by this to say, we became joyful. When? <q>When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion.</q> What is Sion? Jerusalem, the same is also the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Sion. How is Sion <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, how is Sion captive? In <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, in men captive. For not all the citizens of that city are captives, but those who are away from thence, they are captives. Man was a citizen of Jerusalem, but sold under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he became a pilgrim. Of his progeny was born the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and the captivity of Sion filled all lands. And how is this captivity of Sion a shadow of that Jerusalem? The shadow of that Sion, which was granted to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in an image, in a figure, was in captivity in Babylonia, and after seventy years that people turned back to its own city.. ..But when all time is past, then we return to our country, as after seventy years that people returned from the Babylonish captivity, for <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> is this world; since <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> is interpreted <q>confusion.</q>...So then this whole life of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs is confusion, which belongs not unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In this confusion, in this Babylonish land, Sion is held captive. But <q>the Lord has turned back the captivity of Sion.</q> <q>And we became,</q> he says, <q>as those that are comforted.</q> That is, we rejoiced as receiving consolation. Consolation is not save for the unhappy, consolation is not save for them that groan, that mourn. Wherefore, <q>as those that are comforted,</q> except because we are still mourning? We mourn for our present lot, we are comforted in hope: when the present is passed by, of our mourning will come everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, when there will be no need of consolation, because we shall be wounded with no distress. But wherefore says he <q>as</q> those that are comforted, and says not comforted? This word <q>as,</q> is not always put for likeness: when we say <q>As,</q> it sometimes refers to the actual case, sometimes to likeness: here it is with reference to the actual case....Walk therefore in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and sing rejoicing, sing as one that is comforted; because He went before you who has commanded you to follow Him.</p>

<p>3. <q>Then was our mouth filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and our tongue with exultation</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa125.htm#verse2">Psalm 125:2</a></span>. That mouth, brethren, which we have in our body, how is it <q>filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a></q>? It uses not to be <q>filled,</q> save with meat, or drink, or some such thing put into the mouth. Sometimes our mouth is filled; and it is more that we say to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>,  when we have our mouth full, we cannot speak. But we have a mouth within, that is, in the heart, whence whatsoever proceeds, if it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, defiles us, if it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, cleanses us. For concerning this very mouth ye heard when the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was read. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> reproached the Lord, because His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> ate with unwashen hands.  They reproached who had cleanness without; and within were full of stains. They reproached, whose righteousness was only in the eyes of men. But the Lord sought our inward cleanness, which if we have, the outside must needs be clean also. <q>Cleanse,</q> He says, <q>the inside,</q> and <q>the outside shall be clean also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185498"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;23:26</a></span> ...</p>

<p>4. But let us return to what was just now read from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, relating to the verse before us, <q>Our mouth was filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and our tongue with delight:</q> for we are inquiring what mouth and what tongue. Listen, beloved brethren. The Lord was scoffed at, because His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> ate with unwashed hands. The Lord answered them as was fitting, and said unto the crowds whom He had called unto Him, <q>Hear ye all, and understand: not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185499"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;15:10-11</a></span> What is this? When He said, what goes into the mouth, He meant only the mouth of the body. For meat goes in, and meats defile not a man; because, <q>All things are clean to the clean;</q> and, <q>every creature of God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and none to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185500"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:4</a></span> ...</p>

<p>5. Guard the mouth of your heart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and you will be innocent: the tongue of your body will be innocent, your hands will be innocent; even your feet will be innocent, your eyes, your ears, will be innocent; all your members will serve under righteousness, because a righteous commander has your heart. <q>Then shall they say among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, the Lord has done great things for them.</q></p>

<p>6. <q>Yea, the Lord has done great things for us already, whereof we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa125.htm#verse3">Psalm 125:3</a></span>. Consider, my brethren, if Sion does not at present say this among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, throughout the whole world; consider if men are not running unto the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In the whole world our redemption is received; <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> is answered. The dwellers in Jerusalem, therefore, captive, destined to return, pilgrims, sighing for their country, speak thus among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. What do they say? <q>The Lord has done great things for us, whereof we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</q> Have they done anything for themselves? They have done ill with themselves, for they have sold themselves under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. The Redeemer came, and did the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things for them.</p>

<p>7. <q>Turn our captivity, O Lord, as the torrents in the south</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa125.htm#verse4">Psalm 125:4</a></span>. Consider, my brethren, what this means....As torrents are turned in the south, so turn our captivity. In a certain passage <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, in admonishing us concerning good works, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also shall melt away, even as the ice in fair warm weather.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185501"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse17">Sirach&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> therefore bound us. How? As the cold binds the water that it run not. Bound with the frost of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, we have frozen. But the south wind is a warm wind: when the south wind blows, the ice melts, and the torrents are filled. Now winter streams are called torrents; for filled with sudden rains they run with great force. We had therefore become frozen in captivity; our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> bound us: the south wind the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has blown: our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven us, we are released from the frost of iniquity; as the ice in fair weather, our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are melted. Let us run unto our country, as the torrents in the south....</p>

<p>8. For the next words are, <q>They that sow in tears, shall reap in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa125.htm#verse5">Psalm 125:5</a></span>. In this life, which is full of tears, let us sow. What shall we sow? Good works. Works of mercy are our seeds: of which seeds the Apostle says, <q>Let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185502"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;6:9</a></span> Speaking therefore of almsgiving itself, what says he? <q>This I say; he that sows sparingly, shall reap also sparingly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185503"><a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:6</a></span> He therefore who sows plentifully, shall reap plentifully: he who sows sparingly, shall reap also sparingly: and he that sows nothing, shall reap nothing. Why do ye long for ample estates, where ye may sow plentifully? There is not a wider field on which you can sow than Christ, who has willed that we should sow in Himself. Your soil is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; sow as much as you can. But you have not enough to do this. Have you the will?  As what you had would be nothing, if you had not a good will; so do not despond, because you have not, if you have a good will. For what do you sow? Mercy. And what will you reap? Peace. Said the Angels, Peace on earth unto rich men? No, but, <q>Peace on earth unto men of a good will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185505"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;2:14</a></span> Zacch&aelig;us had a strong will, Zacch&aelig;us had great charity. <span class="stiki" id="note185506"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;19:8</a></span> ...Did then that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who cast her two farthings into the treasury, sow little? Nay, as much as Zacch&aelig;us. For she had narrower means, but an equal will. She gave her two mites <span class="stiki" id="note185507"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;21:1-4</a></span> with as good a will as Zacch&aelig;us gave the half of his patrimony. If you consider what they gave, you will find their gifts different; if you look to the source, you will find them equal; she gave whatever she had, and he gave what he had....But if they are beggars whose profession is asking <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, in trouble they also have what to bestow upon one another. God has not so forsaken them, but that they have wherein they may be tried by their bestowing of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. This man cannot walk; he who can walk, lends his feet to the lame; he who sees, lends his eyes to the blind; and he who is young and sound, lends his strength to the old or the infirm, carries him: the one is poor, the other is rich.</p>

<p>9. Sometimes also the rich man is found to be poor, and something is bestowed upon him by the poor. Somebody comes to a river, so much the more delicate as he is more rich; he cannot pass over: if he were to pass over with bare limbs, he would catch cold, would be ill, would die: a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man more active in body comes up: he carries the rich man over; he gives <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> unto the rich. Think not therefore those only poor, who have not money....Thus <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> ye, thus be ye affectioned unto one another. Attend not solely to yourselves: but to those who are in want around you. But because these things take place in this life with troubles and cares, faint not. You sow in tears, you shall reap in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</p>

<p>10. How, my brethren? When the farmer goes forth with the plough, carrying seed, is not the wind sometimes keen, and does not the shower sometimes deter him? He looks to the sky, sees it lowering, shivers with cold, nevertheless goes forth, and sows. For he fears lest while he is observing the foul weather, and awaiting sunshine, the time may pass away, and he may not find anything to reap. Put not off, my brethren; sow in wintry weather, sow good works, even while you weep; for, <q>They that sow in tears, shall reap in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q> They sow their seed, good will, and good works. <q>They went on their way and wept, casting their seed</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa125.htm#verse6">Psalm 125:6</a></span>. Why did they weep? Because they were among the miserable, and were themselves miserable. It is better, my brethren, that no man should be miserable, than that you should do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>....Nevertheless, as long as there are objects for its exercise, let us not fail amid those troubles to sow our seed. Although we sow in tears, yet shall we reap in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For in that resurrection of the dead, each man shall receive his own sheaves, that is, the produce of his seed, the crown of joys and of delight. Then will there be a joyous triumph, when we shall laugh at death, wherein we groaned before: then shall they say to death, <q>O death, where is your strife? O death, where is your sting?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185508"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse55">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:55</a></span> But why do they now <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>? Because <q>they bring their sheaves with them.</q></p>

<p>11. In this Psalm we have chiefly exhorted you to do <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, because it is thence that we ascend; and you see that he who ascends,  sings the song of steps. Remember: do not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to descend, instead of to ascend, but reflect upon your ascent: because he who descended from Jerusalem to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> fell among thieves. <span class="stiki" id="note185509"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;10:30</a></span> ...The <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> as He passed by slighted us not: He healed us, He raised us upon His beast, upon His flesh; He led us to the inn, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; He entrusted us to the host, that is, to the Apostle; He gave two pence, whereby we might be healed, <span class="stiki" id="note185510"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;10:35,&nbsp;37</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our neighbour. The Apostle spent more; for, though it was allowed unto all the Apostles to receive, as Christ's soldiers, pay from Christ's subjects,  that Apostle, nevertheless, toiled with his own hands, and excused the subjects the maintenance owing to him.  All this has already happened: if we have descended, and have been wounded; let us ascend, let us sing, and make progress, in order that we may arrive.</p>
