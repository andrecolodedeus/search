<h1>Exposition on Psalm 13</h1>


<p>Unto the end, a psalm of David.</p>

<p>1. <q>For Christ is the end of the law to every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180479"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> <q>How long, O Lord, will You forget me unto the end?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa012.htm#verse1">Psalm 12:1</a></span> that is, put me off as to spiritually understanding Christ, who is the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> end of all the aim of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>How long will  You turn away Your face from me?</q> As God does not forget, so neither does He turn His face away: but Scripture speaks after our manner. Now God is said to turn away His face, when He does not give to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which as yet has not the pure eye of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself.</p>

<p>2. <q>How long shall I place counsel in my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa012.htm#verse2">Psalm 12:2</a></span>. There is no need of counsel but in adversity. Therefore <q>How long shall I place counsel in my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>?</q> is as if it were said, How long shall I be in adversity? Or at least it is an answer, so that the meaning is this, So long, O Lord, will You forget me to the end, and so long turn away Your face from me, until I shall place counsel in my own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: so that except a man place counsel in his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to work mercy perfectly, God will not direct him to the end, nor give him that full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself, which is <q>face to face.</q> <q>Sorrow in my heart through the day?</q> How long shall I have, is understood. And <q>through the day</q> signifies continuance, so that day is taken for time: from which as each one longs to be free, he has sorrow in his heart, making entreaty to rise to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and not endure man's day.</p>

<p>3. <q>How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</q> either the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, or carnal habit.</p>

<p>4. <q>Look on me, and hear me, O Lord my God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa012.htm#verse3">Psalm 12:3</a></span>. <q>Look on me,</q> refers to what was said, <q>How long</q> dost <q>Thou turn away Your face from me.</q> <q>Hear,</q> refers to what was said, <q>How long will You forget me to the end? Lighten my eyes, that I sleep not in death.</q> The eyes of the heart must be understood, that they be not closed by the pleasurable eclipse of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>5. <q>Lest at any time mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa012.htm#verse4">Psalm 12:4</a></span>. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> mockery is to be feared. <q>They that trouble me will exult, if I be moved;</q> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; who exulted not over that righteous man, Job, when they troubled him; because he was not moved, that is, did not draw back from the steadfastness of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note180480"><a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse3">Job&nbsp;2:3</a></span> </p>

<p>6. <q>But I have hoped in Your mercy</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa012.htm#verse5">Psalm 12:5</a></span>. Because this very thing, that a man be not moved, and that he abide fixed in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, he should not attribute to self: lest when he glories that he has not been moved, he be moved by this very <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. <q>My heart shall exult in Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>;</q> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>I will sing  to the Lord who has given me <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things;</q> spiritual <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, not belonging to man's day. <q>And I will chant  to the name of the Lord most high</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa012.htm#verse6">Psalm 12:6</a></span>; that is, I give thanks with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and in most due order employ my body, which is the song of the spiritual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But if any distinction is to be marked here, <q>I will sing</q> with the heart, <q>I will chant</q> with my works; <q>to the Lord,</q> that which He alone sees, but <q>to the name of the Lord,</q> that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which is serviceable not for Him, but for us.</p>
