<h1>Exposition on Psalm 136</h1>


<p>1. <q>Give thanks unto the Lord, for He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, for His mercy endures for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse1">Psalm 135:1</a></span>. This Psalm contains the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all its verses finish in the same way. Wherefore although many things are related here in praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet His mercy is most commended;  for without this plain commendation, he, whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> used to utter this Psalm, would have no verse be ended. Although after the judgment, by which at the end of the world the quick and the dead must be judged, the just being sent into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note185672"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;25:46</a></span> there will not afterwards be those, whom God will have mercy on, yet rightly may His future mercy be understood to be for ever, which He bestows on His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and faithful ones, not because they will be miserable for ever, and therefore will need His mercy for ever, but because that very blessedness, which He mercifully bestows on the miserable, that they cease to be miserable, and begin to be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, will have no end, and therefore <q>His mercy is for ever.</q> For that we shall be just from being <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, whole from being unsound, alive from being dead, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> from being mortal, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> from being wretched, is of His mercy. But this that we shall be, will be for ever, and therefore <q>His mercy is for ever.</q> Wherefore, <q>give thanks to the Lord;</q> that is, praise the Lord by giving thanks, <q>for He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>:</q> nor is it any temporal good you will gain from this confession, for, <q>His mercy endures for ever;</q> that is, the benefit which He bestows mercifully upon you, is for ever. </p>

<p>2. Then follows, <q>Give thanks to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods, for His mercy endures for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse2">Psalm 135:2</a></span>. <q>Give thanks to the Lord of lords, for His mercy endures for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse3">Psalm 135:3</a></span>. We may well enquire, Who are these gods and lords, of whom He who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God is God and Lord? And we find written in another Psalm, that even men are called gods.  The Lord even takes note of this testimony in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, saying, <q>Is it not written in your Law, I have said, You are gods?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185675"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;10:34</a></span> ...It is not therefore because they are all good, but because <q>the word of God came to them,</q> that they were called gods. For were it because they are all good, He would not thus distinguish between them. He says, <q>He judges between the gods.</q> Then follows, <q>How long do ye judge iniquity!</q>  and the rest, which He says certainly not to all, but to some, because He says it in distinguishing, and yet He distinguishes between the gods.</p>

<p>3. But it is asked, If men are called gods to whom the word of the Lord came, are the Angels to be called gods, when the greatest reward which is promised to just and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men is the being equal to Angels? In the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether it can, at least easily, be found, that the Angels are openly called gods; but when it had been said of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, <q>He is terrible, above all gods,</q> he adds, as by way of exposition why he says this, <q>for the gods of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are devils,</q>  that we might understand what had been expressed in the Hebrew, <q>the gods of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>,</q> meaning rather the devils which dwell in the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.  For as regards images, which in Greek are called <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, a name we now use in Latin, they have eyes and see not, and all the other things which are said of them, because they are utterly without sense; wherefore they cannot be frightened, for nothing which has no sense can be frightened. How then can it be said of the Lord, <q>He is terrible above all gods, because the gods of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>,</q> if the devils which may be terrified are not understood to be in these images. Whence also the Apostle says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that an idol is nothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185679"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:4</a></span> This refers to its earthy senseless material. But that no one may think, that there is no living and sentient nature, which delights in the Gentile <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, he adds, <q>But what the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to devils, and not to God: I would not have you partaken with devils.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185680"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:20</a></span> If therefore we never find in the divine words that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Angels are called gods, I think the best reason is, that men may not be induced by the name to pay that ministry and service of religion (which in Greek is called <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> or <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>) to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Angels, which neither would they have paid by man at all, save to that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of themselves and men.  Hence they are much more correctly called Angels, which in Latin is <em>Nuntii</em>, that by the name of their function, not their substance, we may plainly understand that they would have us worship the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom they announce. The whole then of that question the Apostle has briefly expounded, when he says, <q>For though there be who are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, as there are gods many and lords many; yet we have one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, from whom are all, and we in Him; and one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom are all things, and we by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185682"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:5-6</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Let us therefore <q>give thanks to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods, and the Lord of lords, for His mercy,</q> etc. <q>Who alone did wonderful things</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse4">Psalm 135:4</a></span>. As at the last part of every verse, it is written, <q>For His mercy endures for ever,</q> so we must understand at the beginning of each, though it be not written, <q>Give thanks.</q> Which indeed in the Greek is very plain. It would be so in Latin, if our translators had been able to make use of that expression. Which indeed they could have done in this verse, if they had said, <q>To Him who does  wonderful things.</q> For where we have, <q>who did wonderful things,</q> the Greek has <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1FF7; &#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x1F75;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;</span>, where we must necessarily understand, <q>give thanks.</q> And I would they had added the pronoun, and said to Him, <q>who did,</q> or to Him <q>who does,</q> or to Him <q>who made sure;</q> because then one might easily understand, <q>let us give thanks.</q> For now it is so obscurely rendered, that he who either <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not or cares not to examine a Greek manuscript may think, <q>who made the heavens, who made sure the earth, who made the luminaries, for His mercy endures for ever,</q>  has been so said, because He did these things for this reason, <q>because His mercy endures for ever:</q> whereas they, whom He has freed from misery, belong to His Mercy: but not that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He makes sky, earth, and luminaries, of His Mercy; since they are marks of His Goodness, who created all things very good. <span class="stiki" id="note185685"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis&nbsp;1:31</a></span> For He created all things, that they might have their being; <span class="stiki" id="note185686"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse14">Wisdom&nbsp;1:14</a></span> but it is the work of His Mercy, to cleanse us from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and deliver us from everlasting misery. And so the Psalm thus addresses us, <q>Give thanks unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods, give thanks unto the Lord of lords.</q> Give thanks to Him, <q>who alone does great wonders;</q> give thanks to Him, <q>who by His wisdom made the heavens;</q> give thanks to Him, <q>who stretched out the earth above the waters;</q> give thanks to Him, <q>who alone made great lights.</q> But why we are to praise, he sets down at the end of all the verses, <q>for His mercy endures for ever.</q></p>

<p>5. But what means, <q>who alone does great wonders</q>? Is it because many wonderful things He has done by means of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men? Some wonderful things there are which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does alone, and these he enumerates, saying, <q>who by His wisdom made the heavens</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse5">Psalm 135:5</a></span>, <q>who stretched out the earth above the waters</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse6">Psalm 135:6</a></span>, <q>who alone made great lights</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse7">Psalm 135:7</a></span>. For this reason did he add <q>alone</q> in this verse also, because the other wonders which he is about to tell of, God did by means of man. For having said, <q>who alone made great lights,</q> he goes on to explain what these are, <q>the sun to rule the day</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse8">Psalm 135:8</a></span>, <q>the moon and stars to govern the night</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse9">Psalm 135:9</a></span>; then he begins to tell the wonders which He did by means of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men: <q>who smote <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with their <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse10">Psalm 135:10</a></span>, and the rest. The whole creation then God manifestly made, not by means of any creature, but <q>alone;</q> and of this creation he has mentioned certain more eminent parts, that they might make us think on the whole; the heavens we can understand,  and the earth we see. And as there are visible heavens too, by mentioning the lights in them, he has bid us look on the whole body of the heavens as made by Him.</p>

<p>6. However, whether by what he says, <q>who made the heavens in understanding,</q> or, as others have rendered it, <q>in intelligence,</q> he meant to signify, the heavens we can understand, or that He in His understanding or intelligence, that is, in His wisdom made the heavens (as it is elsewhere written, <q>in wisdom have You made them all</q> ), implying thereby the only-begotten Word, may be a question. But if it be so, that we are to understand that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> by His wisdom made the heavens,</q> why says He this only of the heavens, whereas God made all things by the same wisdom? It is that it needed only to be expressed there, so that in the rest it might be understood without being written. How then could it be <q>alone,</q> if <q>in understanding</q> or <q>in intelligence</q> means <q>by His wisdom,</q> that is, by the only-begotten Word? Is it that, inasmuch as the Trinity is not three Gods, but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he states that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made these things alone, because He made not creation by means of any creature?</p>

<p>7. But what is, <q>who laid out the earth above the waters</q>? For it is a difficult question, because the earth seems to be the heavier, so that it should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not so much to be borne on the waters, as to bear the waters. And that we may not seem contentiously to maintain our Scriptures against those who think that they have discovered these matters on sure principles, we have a second interpretation to give, that the earth which is inhabited by men, and contains the living creatures of the earth, is <q>laid out above the waters</q> because it stands out above the waters which surround it. For when we speak of a city on the sea being built <q>above the waters,</q> it is not meant that the sea is under it in the same way as the waters are under the chambers of caverns, or under ships sailing over them; but it is said to be <q>above</q> the sea, because it stands up above the sea below it.</p>

<p>8. But if these words further signify something else which more closely concerns us, God <q>by His wisdom made the heavens,</q> that is, His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, spiritual men, to whom He has given not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but also to understand things divine; those who cannot yet attain to this, and only hold their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> firmly, as being beneath the heavens, are figured by the name of earth. And because they abide with unshaken belief upon the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> they have received, therefore it is said, <q>He laid out the earth above the waters.</q> Further, since it is written of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that <q>in Him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185689"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;2:3</a></span> and that these two, wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, differ somewhat from one another is testified by other utterances of Scripture, especially in the words of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Job,  where both are in a manner defined; not unsuitably then do we understand wisdom to consist in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of That which ever is and abides unchangeable, which is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For where he says, <q><a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>  is wisdom,</q> in Greek is <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;<!--k29--&#183;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>, and to express the whole of this in Latin, we may call it worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  But to depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which he calls <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, what else is it but to walk cautiously and heedfully <q>in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185693"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> in the night, as it were, of this world, that each one by keeping himself from iniquity may avoid being confounded with the darkness, distinguished by the light of his proper gift....</p>

<p>9. <q>Who brought out <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from the midst of them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse11">Psalm 135:11</a></span>. He brought out also His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and faithful ones from the midst of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. <q>With a mighty Hand and stretched-out Arm</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse12">Psalm 135:12</a></span>. What more powerful, what more out-stretched, than that of which is said <q>To whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185694"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1</a></span> <q>Who divided the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> in two parts</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse13">Psalm 135:13</a></span>. He divided also in such wise, that the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be to some unto life, to others unto death. <q>And brought out <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> through the midst of it</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse14">Psalm 135:14</a></span>. So too He brings out His renewed people through the laver of regeneration. <q>And overthrew <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and his power in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse15">Psalm 135:15</a></span>. He quickly destroys both the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of His people and the guilt thereof by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <q>Who led His people through the wilderness</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse16">Psalm 135:16</a></span>. Us too He leads through the drought and barrenness of this world, that we perish not therein. <q>Who smote great kings</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse17">Psalm 135:17</a></span>, <q>and slew famous kings</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse18">Psalm 135:18</a></span>. From us too He smites and slays the deadly powers of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <q>Sehon king of the Amorites</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse19">Psalm 135:19</a></span>, an <q>useless shoot,</q> or <q>fiery <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> for so is Sehon interpreted: the king of <q>them who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> bitterness,</q> for such is the meaning of Amorites. <q>And Og, the king of Basan</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa135.htm#verse20">Psalm 135:20</a></span>. The <q>heaper-together,</q> such is the meaning of Og, and, king of <q>confusion,</q> which Basan signifies.
