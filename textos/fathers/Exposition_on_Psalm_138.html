<h1>Exposition on Psalm 138</h1>


<p>1. The title of this Psalm is brief and simple, and need not detain us; since we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whose resemblance David wore, and since in him we recognise ourselves also, for we too are members of that Body. The whole title is, <q>To David himself.</q> Let us see then, what is to David himself. The title of the Psalm is wont to tell us what is treated of within it: but in this, since the title informs us not of this, but tells us only to Whom it is chanted, the first verse tells us what is treated of in the whole Psalm, <q>I will confess to You.</q> This confession then let us hear. But first I remind you, that the term confession in Scripture, when we speak of confession to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is used in two senses, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and of praise. But confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, confession of praise few attend to. So well known is confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that, wherever in Scripture we hear the words, <q>I will confess to You, O Lord,</q> or, <q>we will confess to You,</q> immediately, through <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> understanding in this way, our hands hurry to beating our breast: so entirely are men wont not to understand confession to be of anything, save of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But was then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself too a sinner, who says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>I confess to You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth</q>?  He goes on to say what He confesses, that we might understand His confession to be of praise, not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <q>I confess to You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and hast revealed them unto babes.</q> He praised the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, he praised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He despises not the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. And such confession are we now going to hear, of praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of thanksgiving. <q>With my whole heart.</q> My whole heart I lay upon the altar of Your praise, an whole burnt-offering  of praise I offer to You....<q>I will confess to You, O Lord, with my whole heart: for You have heard the words of my mouth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa137.htm#verse1">Psalm 137:1</a></span>. What mouth, save my heart? For there have we the voice which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> hears, which ear of man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not at all. We have then a mouth within, there do we ask, thence do we ask, and if we have prepared a lodging or an house for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there do we speak, there are we heard. <q>For He is not far from every one of us, for in Him we live, and move, and have our being.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185703"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse27">Acts&nbsp;17:27-28</a></span> Nought makes you far off from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> only. Cast down the middle wall of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and you are with Him whom you ask.</p>

<p>2. <q>And before the Angels will I sing unto You.</q> Not before men will I sing, but before the Angels. My song is my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; but my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in things below is before men, my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in things above before the Angels. For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the just: <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, says my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> rejoices in his tavern, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> in his chain. In what did that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Crispina <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, whose festival is kept today? She rejoiced when she was being seized, when she was being carried before the judge, when she was being put into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, when she was being brought forth bound, when she was being lifted up on the scaffold,  when she was being heard, when she was being condemned: in all these things she rejoiced; and the wretches thought her wretched, when she was rejoicing before the Angels.</p>

<p>3. <q>I will worship toward Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Temple</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa137.htm#verse2">Psalm 137:2</a></span>. What <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Temple? That where we shall dwell, where we shall worship. For we hasten that we may adore. Our heart is pregnant and comes to the birth, and seeks where it may bring forth. What is the place where God is to be worshipped?...<q>The Temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> says the Apostle, <q>which Temple you are.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185706"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> But assuredly, as is manifest, God dwells in the Angels. Therefore when our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, being in spiritual things, not in earthly, takes up a song to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to sing before the Angels, that very assembly of Angels is the Temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we worship toward God's Temple. There is a Church below, there is a Church above also; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> below, in all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> above, in all the Angels. But the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Angels came down to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> below, and Angels ministered to Him on earth, <span class="stiki" id="note185707"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;4:11</a></span> while He ministered to us; for, <q>I came not,</q> says He, <q>to be ministered unto, but to minister.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185708"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;20:28</a></span> ...The Lord of Angels died for man. Therefore, <q>I will worship toward Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Temple;</q> I mean, not the temple made with hands, but that which You have made for Yourself.</p>

<p>4. <q>And I will confess to Your Name in Your mercy and Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>...These also which You have given to me, do I according to my power give to You in return: mercy, in aiding others; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in judging. By these God aids us, by these we win God's favour. Rightly, therefore, <q>All the ways of the Lord are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> No other ways are there whereby He can come to us, no other whereby we can come to Him. <q>For You have magnified Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Name over everything.</q> What sort of thanksgiving is this, brethren? He has magnified His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Name over <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was born Isaac; over that house God was magnified; then Jacob; God was magnified, who said, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.</q> Then came his twelve sons. The name of the Lord was magnified over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Then came the Virgin Mary. Then Christ our Lord, <q>dying for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, rising again for our justification,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185709"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;4:25</a></span> filling the faithful with His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, sending forth men to proclaim throughout the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <q>Repent ye,</q> etc. <span class="stiki" id="note185710"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a></span> Behold, <q>He has magnified His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Name above all things.</q></p>

<p>5. <q>In what day soever I call upon You, do Thou quickly hear me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa137.htm#verse3">Psalm 137:3</a></span>. Wherefore, <q>quickly</q>? Because You have said, <q>While yet you are speaking I will say, Lo, here I am.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185711"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;58:9</a></span> Wherefore, <q>quickly</q>? Because now I seek not earthly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, I have learned <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> longings from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. I seek not earth, nor earthly abundance, nor temporal health, nor the overthrow of my enemies, nor riches, nor rank: nought of these do I seek: therefore <q>quickly hear me.</q> Since You have taught me what to seek, grant what I seek....</p>

<p>6. Let us see then what he seeks, with what right he has said, <q>quickly hear me.</q> For what do you seek, that you should quickly be heard? <q>You shall multiply me.</q> In many ways may multiplication be understood....For men are multiplied in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with cares: a man seems to be multiplied in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in whom <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> even are multiplied. That is the multiplication of want, not of fullness. What then do you desire, thou who hast said, <q>quickly hear me,</q> and hast withdrawn yourself entirely from the body, from every earthly thing, from every earthly desire, so as to say to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>You shall multiply me in my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></q>? Explain yet further what you desire. You shall multiply me, says he, in my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <q>with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</q>...</p>

<p>7. <q>Let all the kings of the earth confess to You, O Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa137.htm#verse4">Psalm 137:4</a></span>. So shall it be, and so it is, and that daily; and it is shown that it was not said in vain, save that it was future. But neither let them, when they confess to You, when they praise You, desire earthly things of You. For what shall the kings of the earth desire? Have they not already sovereignty? Whatever more a man desire on earth, sovereignty is the highest point of his desire. What more can he desire? It must needs be some loftier eminence. But perhaps the loftier it is, the more dangerous. And therefore the more exalted kings are in earthly eminence, the more ought they to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves before God. What do they do? <q>Because they have heard all the words of Your mouth.</q> In a certain nation were hidden the Law and the Prophets, <q>all the words of Your mouth:</q> in the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation alone were <q>all the words of Your mouth,</q> the nation which the Apostle praises, saying, <q>What advantage has the Jew? Much every way; chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> These were the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note185712"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;3:1-2</a></span> ...What meant Gideon's fleece? It is like the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the midst of the world, which had the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, not indeed openly manifested, but hidden in a cloud, or in a veil, like the dew in the fleece. <span class="stiki" id="note185713"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse37">Judges&nbsp;6:37,&nbsp;39</a></span> The time came when the dew was to be manifested in the floor; it was manifested, no longer hidden. Christ alone is the sweetness of dew: Him alone you recognise not in Scripture, for whom Scripture was written. But yet, <q>they have heard all the words of your mouth.</q></p>

<p>8. <q>And let them sing in the paths of the Lord, that great is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa137.htm#verse5">Psalm 137:5</a></span>. Let all the kings of the earth sing in the paths of the Lord. In what paths? Those that are spoken of above, <q>in Your mercy and Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Let not then the kings of the earth be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, let them be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. Then let them sing in the ways of the Lord, if they be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>: let them <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and they shall sing. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> travellers that sing; they sing, and hasten to reach the end of their journey. There are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> songs, such as belong to the old man; to the new man belongs a new song. Let then the kings of the earth too walk in Your paths, let them walk and sing in Your paths. Sing what? That <q>great is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord,</q> not of kings.</p>

<p>9. See how he willed that kings should sing on their way, humbly bearing the Lord, not lifting themselves up against the Lord. For if they lift themselves up, what follows? <q>For the Lord is high, and has respect unto the lowly</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa137.htm#verse6">Psalm 137:6</a></span>. Do kings then desire that He have respect unto them? Let them be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. What then? If they lift themselves up to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, can they escape His eyes? Lest perchance, because you have heard, <q>He has respect unto the lowly,</q> thou choose to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and say in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, God has respect unto the lowly, He has not respect unto me, I will do what I will. O foolish one! Would you say this, if you knew what you ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Behold, even if God wills not to see you, do you not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> this very thing, that He wills not to see you?...The lofty then, it seems, He has not respect unto, for it is the lowly He respects. <q>The lofty</q>&mdash; what? <q>He considers from afar.</q> What then gains the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>? To be seen from afar, not to escape being seen. And think not that you must needs be safe on that account, for that He sees less clearly, who sees you from afar. For thou indeed see not clearly, what you see from afar; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although He see you from afar, sees you perfectly, yet is He not with you. This you gain, not that you are less perfectly seen, but that you are not with Him by whom you are seen. But what does the lowly gain? <q>The Lord is near unto them that are of a contrite heart.</q> Let the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> then lift himself up as much as he will, certainly God dwells on high, God is in heaven: do you wish that He come near to you? Humble yourself. For the higher will He be above you, the more you lift yourself up.</p>

<p>10. <q>If I walk in the midst of tribulation, You shall revive me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa137.htm#verse7">Psalm 137:7</a></span>. True it is: whatsoever tribulation you are in, confess, call on Him; He frees you, He revives you....Love the other life, and you shall see that this life is tribulation, whatever prosperity it shine with, whatever delights it abound and overflow with; since not yet have we that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> most safe and free from all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> reserves for us in the end, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it is tribulation. Let us understand then what tribulation he means here too, brethren. Not as though he said, <q>If perchance there shall any tribulation have befallen me, You shall free me therefrom.</q> But how says he? <q>If I walk,</q> etc.; that is, otherwise You will not revive me, unless I walk in the midst of tribulation.</p>

<p>11. <q>You have stretched forth Your hand over the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of mine enemies, and Your right hand has made me safe.</q> Let mine enemies rage: what can they do? They can take my money, strip, proscribe, banish me; afflict me with grief and tortures; at last, if they be allowed, even kill me: can they do anything more? But over that which mine enemies can do, You have stretched forth Your hand. For mine enemies cannot separate me from You: but You avenge me the more, the more Thou as yet delayest....Yet not to make me despair; for it follows, <q>and Your right hand has made me safe.</q></p>

<p>12. <q>You, Lord, shall recompense for me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa137.htm#verse8">Psalm 137:8</a></span>. I recompense not: You shall recompense. Let mine enemies rage their full: You shall recompense what I cannot....<q>Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves,</q> says the Apostle, <q>but rather give place unto <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; for it is written, Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185714"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;12:19</a></span> There is here another sense not to be neglected, perhaps even to be preferred. <q>Lord</q> Christ, <q>You shall repay for me.</q> For I, if I repay, have seized; You have paid what You have not seized. Lord, You shall <q>repay for me.</q> Behold Him repaying for us. They came to Him, who exacted tribute: <span class="stiki" id="note185715"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;17:24-26</a></span> they used to demand as tribute a didrachma, that is, two drachmas for one man; they came to the Lord to pay tribute; or rather, not to Him, but to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and they said to them, <q>Does not your Master pay tribute?</q> They came and told Him. He says unto Peter, <q>lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first comes up: and when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a stater:  that take, and give for Me and you.</q> The first that rises from the sea, is the First-begotten from the dead. In His mouth we find two didrachmas, that is, four drachmas: in His mouth we find the four <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. By those four drachmas we are free from the claims of this world, by the four Evangelists we remain no longer debtors; for there the debt of all our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is paid. He then has repaid for us, thanks to His mercy. He owed nothing: He repaid not for Himself: He repaid for us....</p>

<p>13. <q>Lord, Your mercy is for everlasting.</q>...Not for a time only do I desire to be freed. <q>Your mercy is for everlasting,</q> wherewith You have freed the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and so hast quickly taken them from this life. <q>Despise not Thou the works of Your own hands.</q> I say not, Lord, <q>despise not the works of my hands:</q> of my own works I boast not. <q>I sought,</q> indeed, <q>the Lord with my hands in the night season before Him, and have not been deceived;</q> but yet I praise not the works of my own hands; I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest, when You shall look into them, Thou find more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in them than deserts. Behold in me Your Work, not mine: for mine if You see, You condemn; Yours, if You see, You crown.
