<h1>Exposition on Psalm 139</h1>


<p>1. ...<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> speaks in the Prophets, sometimes in His own Name, sometimes in ours, because He makes Himself one with us; as it is said, <q>they two shall be one flesh.</q> Wherefore also the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, speaking of marriage, <q>therefore they are no more two, but one flesh.</q> One flesh, because of our mortality He took flesh; not one divinity, for He is the Creator, we the creature. Whatsoever then our Lord speaks in the person of the Flesh He took upon Him, belongs both to that Head which has already ascended into heaven, and to those members which still toil in their earthly wandering. Let us hear then <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> speaking in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. For the Psalms were sung long before the Lord was born of <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>, yet not before He was Lord: for from everlasting He was the Creator of all things, but in time He was born of His creature. Let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Godhead, and, so far as we can, understand Him to be equal to the Father. But that Godhead equal to the Father was made partaker of our mortal nature, not of His own store, but of ours; that we too might be made partakers of His Divine Nature, not of our store, but of His.</p>

<p>2. <q>Lord, You have tried me, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse1">Psalm 138:1</a></span>. Let the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself say this; let Him too say, <q>Lord,</q> to the Father. For His Father is not His Lord, save because He has deigned to be born according to the flesh. He is Father of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Lord of the Man. Would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to whom He is Father? To the coequal Son. The Apostle says, <q>Who, being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185719"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6-7</a></span> To this <q>Form</q> God is Father, the <q>Form</q> equal to Himself, the only-begotten Son, begotten of His Substance. But forasmuch as for our sakes, that we might be re-made, and made partakers of His Divine Nature, being renewed unto life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, He was made partaker of our mortal nature, what says the Apostle of Him? He says, <q>yet He emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and was found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> He was in the Form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, equal to the Father; He took upon Him the form of a servant, so as therein to be less than the Father....</p>

<p>3. <q>You have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> My down-sitting and Mine up-rising</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse2">Psalm 138:2</a></span>. What here is <q>down-sitting,</q> what <q>up-rising</q>? He who sits, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself. The Lord then <q>sat</q> in His Passion, <q>up-rose</q> in His Resurrection. <q>You,</q> he says, hast <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> this; that is, You have willed, You have approved; according to Your will was it done. But if you choose to take the words of the Head in the person of the Body: man sits when he <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself in penitence, he rises up when his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, and he is lifted up to the hope of everlasting life. Lift not up yourselves, unless you have first been humbled. For many wish to rise before they have sat down, they wish to appear righteous, before they have confessed that they are sinners....</p>

<p>4. <q>You have understood my thoughts from afar; You have tracked out my path and my limit</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse3">Psalm 138:3</a></span>; <q>and all my ways You have seen beforehand</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse4">Psalm 138:4</a></span>. What is, <q>from afar</q>? While I am yet in my pilgrimage, before I reach that, my <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> country, You have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my thoughts....The younger son went into a far country. After his toil and suffering and tribulation and want, he thought on his father, and desired to return, and said, <q>I will arise, and go to my father.</q> <q>I will arise,</q> said he, for before he had sat. Here then you may recognise him saying, <q>You have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my down-sitting and up-rising.</q> I sat, in want; I arose, in longing for Your Bread. <q>You have understood my thoughts from afar.</q> For far indeed had I gone; but where is not He whom I had left? Wherefore the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that his father met him as he was coming. Truly; for <q>he had understood his thoughts from afar.</q> <q>My path,</q> he says; what, but a bad path, the path he had walked to leave his father?...What is, <q>my path</q>? That by which I have gone. What is, <q>my limit</q>? That whereunto I have reached. <q>You have tracked out my path and my limit.</q> That limit of mine, far distant as it was, was not far from Your eyes. Far had I gone, and yet You were there. <q>And all my ways You have seen beforehand.</q> He said not, <q>hast seen,</q> but, <q>hast seen beforehand.</q> Before I went by them, before I walked in them, You saw them beforehand; and You permitted me in toil to go my own ways, that, if I desired not to toil, I might return into Your ways. <q>For there is no deceit in my tongue.</q>  What meant he by this? Lo, I confess to You, I have walked in my own way, I have become far from You, I have departed from You, with whom it was well with me, and to my good it was ill with me without You....</p>

<p>5. <q>Behold Thou, Lord, hast <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> all my last doings, and the ancient ones</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse5">Psalm 138:5</a></span>. You have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my latest doings, when I fed swine; You have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my ancient doings, when I asked of You my portion of goods. Ancient doings were the beginnings to me of latest ills: ancient <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when we fell; latest punishment, when we came into this toilsome and dangerous mortality. And would that this may be <q>latest</q> to us; it will be, if now we will to return. For there is another <q>latest</q> for certain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ones, to whom it shall be said, <q>Go ye into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185721"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> ...<q>You have fashioned me, and hast laid Your hand upon me.</q> <q>Fashioned me,</q> where? In this mortality; now, to the toils whereunto we all are born. For none is born, but God has fashioned him in his mother's womb; nor is there any creature, whereof God is not the Fashioner. But <q>You have fashioned me</q> in this toil, <q>and laid Your hand upon me,</q> Your avenging hand, putting down the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. For thus healthfully has He cast down the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, that He may lift him up <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.</p>

<p>6. <q>Your skill has displayed itself wonderfully in me: it has waxed mighty: I shall not be able to attain unto it</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse6">Psalm 138:6</a></span>. Listen now and hear somewhat, which is obscure indeed, yet brings no small pleasure in the understanding thereon. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with whom God spoke by a cloud, for, speaking after <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fashion, He must needs speak to His servant through some work of His hands which He assumed,...longed and desired to see the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> appearance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was conversing with him, <q>If now I have found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in Your sight, show me Yourself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185722"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;33:13</a></span> When this he desired vehemently, and would extort from God in that sort of friendly familiarity, if we may so speak, wherewith God deigned to treat him, that he might see His Glory and His Face, in such wise as we can speak of God's Face, He said unto him, <q>You can not see My Face; for no one has seen My Face, and lived;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185723"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;33:20</a></span> but I will place you in a cleft of the rock, and will pass by, and will set My hand upon you; and when I have passed by, you shall see My back parts. And from these words there arises another enigma, that is, an obscure figure of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>When I have passed by,</q> says <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>you shall see My back parts;</q> as though He has on one side His face, on another His back. Far be it from us to have any such thoughts of that Majesty! For whoso has such thoughts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what advantages it him that the temples are closed? He is building an idol in his own heart. In these words then are mighty <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>....They who raged against the Lord, whom they saw, now seek counsel how they may be saved; and it is said to them, <q>Repent, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you in the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be forgiven you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185724"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;2:38</a></span> Behold, they saw the back parts of Him, whose face they could not see. For His Hand was upon their eyes, not for ever, but while He passed by. After He had passed He took away His Hand from their eyes. When the hand was taken from their eyes, they say to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>What shall we do?</q> At first they are fierce, afterwards loving; at first <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, afterwards fearful; at first hard, then pleasant; at first blind, then enlightened....</p>

<p>7. Behold you find that the runaway in a far country cannot escape His eyes, from whom he flees. And whither can he go now, whose <q>limit is tracked out</q>? Behold, what says he? <q>Whither shall I go from Your Spirit?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse7">Psalm 138:7</a></span>. Who can in the world flee from that Spirit, with whom the world is filled? <span class="stiki" id="note185725"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse7">Wisdom&nbsp;1:7</a></span> <q>And whither shall I flee from Your Face?</q> He seeks a place whither to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What place will shelter God's runaway? Men who shelter runaways, ask them from whom they have fled; and when they find any one a slave of some master less powerful than themselves, him they shelter as it were without any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, saying in their hearts, <q>he has not a master by whom he can be tracked out.</q> But when they are told of a powerful master, they either shelter not, or they shelter with great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, because even a powerful man can be deceived. Where is God not? Who can deceive God? Whom does not God see? From whom does not God demand His runaway? Whither then shall that runaway go from the Face of God? He turns him hither and there, as though seeking a spot to flee to.</p>

<p>8. <q>If I go up,</q> says he, <q>to heaven, You are there: if I go down to Hades, You are present</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse8">Psalm 138:8</a></span>. At length, miserable runaway, you have learned, that by no means can you make yourself far from Him, from whom you have wished to remove far away. Behold, He is everywhere; thou, whither will you go? He has found counsel, and that inspired by Him, who now deigns to recall him....If by sinning I go down to the depths of wickednesses, and spurn to confess, saying, <q>Who sees me</q> (for <q>in Hades who shall confess to You?</q> ) there also You are present, to punish. Whither then shall I go that I may flee from Your presence, that is, not find You <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>? This plan he found: So will I flee, says he, from Your Face, so will I flee from Your Spirit; from Your avenging Spirit, Your avenging Face thus will I flee. How? <q>If I take again my wings right forward, and abide in the utmost parts of the sea</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse9">Psalm 138:9</a></span>. So can I flee from Your Face. If he will flee to the utmost part of the sea from the Face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will not He from whom he flees be there?...For what are <q>the utmost parts of the sea,</q> but the end of the world? Thither let us now flee in hope and longing, with the wings of twofold <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; let us have no rest, save in <q>the utmost parts of the sea.</q> For if elsewhere we wish for rest, we shall be hurled headlong into the sea. Let us fly even to the ends of the sea, let us bear ourselves aloft on the wings of twofold <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; meanwhile let us flee to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in hope, and in faithful hope let us meditate on that <q>end of the sea.</q></p>

<p>9. Now listen who may bring us there. The very same One whose face in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> we wish to flee from. For what follows? <q>Even there shall Your hand conduct me, and Your right hand lead me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse10">Psalm 138:10</a></span>. This let us meditate on, beloved brethren, let this be our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, this our consolation. Let us take again through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the wings we lost through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> was the lime of our wings, it clashed us down from the freedom of our sky, that is, the free breezes of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. Thence dashed down we lost our wings, and were, so to speak, imprisoned in the power of the fowler; thence <q>He</q> redeemed us with His Blood, whom we fled from to be caught. He makes us wings of His commandments; we raise them aloft now free from lime....Needs then must we have wings, and needs must He conduct us, for He is our Helper. We have <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>; but even with that <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> what can we do, unless He help us who commands us?</p>

<p>10. And considering the length of the way, what said he to himself? <q>And I said, Peradventure the darkness shall overwhelm me</q><!--(<span class="stiki"></span>-->11. Lo, now I have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, now am I wafted aloft on the wings of twofold <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>....Regarding the length of the way, I said to myself, <q>And the night was light in my delight.</q> The night was made to me light, because in the night I despaired of being able to cross so great a sea, to surmount so long a journey, to reach the utmost parts by persevering to the end. Thanks to Him who sought me when a runaway, who smote my back with strokes of the scourge, who by calling me recalled me from destruction, who made my night light. For it is night so long as we are passing through this life. How was the night made light? Because Christ came down into the night....</p>

<p>11. <q>For darkness shall not be darkened by You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse12">Psalm 138:12</a></span>. Do not thou then darken your darkness; God darkens it not, but enlightens it yet more; for to Him is said in another Psalm, <q>You, Lord, shall light my candle: my God shall enlighten my darkness.</q>  But who are they who <q>darken their darkness,</q> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> darkens not? Evil men, perverse men; when they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, verily they are darkness; when they confess not their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which they have committed but go on to defend them, they <q>darken their darkness.</q> Wherefore now if you have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> you are in darkness, but by confessing your darkness you shall obtain to have your darkness lightened; by defending your darkness, you shall <q>darken your darkness.</q> And where will you escape from double darkness, who wast in difficulty in single darkness?...Let us not <q>darken our darkness</q> by defending our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <q>the night shall be light in our delight.</q></p>

<p>12. <q>And night shall be lightened as the day.</q> <q>Night, as the day.</q> <q>Day</q> to us is worldly prosperity, night adversity in this world: but, if we learn that it is by the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that we suffer adversities, and our Father's scourges are sweet to us, that the Judge's sentence may not be bitter to us, so shall we find the darkness of this night to be, as it were, the light of this night....But when Christ our Lord has come, and has dwelt in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and promised other light, and inspired and given patience, and warned a man not to delight in prosperity or to be crushed by adversity, the man, being faithful, begins to treat this world with indifference; not to be lifted up when prosperity befalls him, nor crushed when adversity, but in all things to praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only when he abounds, but also when he loses; not only when he is in health, but also when he is sick.. ..<q>As is His darkness, so is also His light.</q> His darkness overwhelms me not, because His light lifts me not up.</p>

<p>13. <q>For Thou, O Lord, hast possessed my reins</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse13">Psalm 138:13</a></span>. The Possessor is within; He occupies not only the heart, but also the reins; not only the thoughts, but also the delights: He then possesses that whence I should feel delight at any light in this world: He occupies my reins: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not delight, save from the inward light of His Wisdom. What then? Do you not delight that your affairs are very prosperous, times fortunate to you? Do you not delight in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, in riches, in your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>? <q>I do not,</q> says he. Wherefore? Because <q>You have possessed my reins, O Lord; You have taken me up from my mother's womb.</q> While I was in my mother's womb, I did not regard with indifference the darkness of that night and the light of that night....Now, having been taken up from the womb of that our mother, we look on them with indifference, and say, <q>As is His darkness, so is also His light.</q> Neither does earthly prosperity make us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, nor earthly adversity wretched. We must maintain righteousness, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our neighbours also. After these toils we shall have unfailing light, day without setting. Fleeting is all the light and darkness of this night.</p>

<p>14. <q>I will confess to You, O Lord, for terribly have You been made wonderful: wondrous are Your works, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it right well</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse14">Psalm 138:14</a></span>. Aforetime <q>Your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> was made wonderful from me, it had waxed great, nor could I attain unto it.</q> From me then <q>it had waxed great.</q> Whence does <q>my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></q> now <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> right well,</q> save because the <q>night is light in my delight?</q> save because Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has come unto me, and enlightened my darkness? save because You have possessed my reins? save because You have taken me up from my mother's womb?</p>

<p>15. <q>My bone is not hid from You, which You have made in secret</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse15">Psalm 138:15</a></span>. <q>His bone,</q> he says. What the people call <em>ossum</em>, is in Latin called <em> os.</em> This is the word in the Greek.  For we might think the word <em> os</em> is here the one which makes in the plural <em>ora</em>, not <em>os</em> (short), which makes <em>ossa.</em> He says then, I have a certain bone (<em>ossum</em>) in secret. For this word let us prefer to use; better is it that scholars find fault with us, than that the people understand us not. <q>There is then,</q> says he, a certain bone of mine, within, hidden; You have made within a bone for me in secret, yet is it not hidden from You. In secret have You made it, but have You therefore hidden it from Yourself? This my bone made by You in secret men see not, men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, who hast made. What <q>bone</q> then means he, brethren? Let us seek it, it is <q>in secret.</q> But because as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> we are speaking in the Name of the Lord to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, now we find what bone is of this kind. It is a sort of inward strength; for strength and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> are understood to be in the bones. There is then a sort of inward strength of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, wherein it is not broken. Whatever tortures, whatever tribulations, whatever adversities rage around, that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made strong in secret in us, cannot be broken, yields not. For by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is made a certain strength of patience, of which is said in another Psalm, <q>But my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be subjected to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for of Him is my patience.</q>. ..Wherein do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? <q>In tribulations, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that tribulation works patience.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185731"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> See how that strength is fashioned within in his heart: <q>because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given unto us.</q> So is fashioned and made strong that hidden bone, that it makes us even to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in tribulations. But to men we seem wretched, because that which we have within is hidden from them. <q>And my substance is in the lower parts of the earth.</q> Behold, in flesh is my substance, yet have I a bone within, which You have fashioned, such as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> me never to yield to any <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of this lower region, where still my substance is. For what great matter is it, if an Angel be brave? This is a great matter, if flesh is brave. And whence is flesh brave, whence is an earthen vessel brave, save because in it is made a bone in secret?</p>

<p>16. ...<q>Your eyes did see Mine imperfect one, and in Your book shall all be written</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse16">Psalm 138:16</a></span>, not only the perfect, but also the imperfect. Let not the imperfect <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, only let them advance. Nor yet, because I have said, <q>let them not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,</q> let them <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their imperfection, and remain there, where they are found. Let them advance, as far as in them lies. Daily let them add, daily let them approach; yet let them not fall back from the Body of the Lord: that, compacted in one Body and among these members, they may be counted worthy to have that said of them. <q>By day shall they wander, and none among them.</q> <q>The Day</q> was yet on earth, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Whence He said, <q>Walk while you have the day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185732"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;12:35</a></span> But <q>by day shall</q> His imperfect ones <q>wander.</q> They too thought that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was only man, that He had not within Him the hidden Godhead, that He was not secretly <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that He was that only which was seen: this they too thought....But what is, <q>In the day they shall wander</q>? Shall they perish? Where then is, <q>In Your book shall all be written</q>? When then did they <q>wander in the day</q>? When they understood not the Lord set upon earth. And what follows? <q>But to me Your friends are made very <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, O God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse17">Psalm 138:17</a></span>; those very ones, who <q>wandered in the day, and none was in them,</q> became Your friends, and were made very <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> to me. That bone was made in them in secret after the resurrection of the Lord, and they suffered for His Name, at whose death they had been amazed. <q>Mightily strengthened were their chieftainships.</q> They became Apostles, they became leaders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they became rams leading their flocks, <q>mightily strengthened.</q></p>

<p>17. <q>I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse18">Psalm 138:18</a></span>. By means of them, who <q>wandered in the day,</q> lo! There has been born all this great multitude, which now is like the sand innumerable, save by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He said, <q>they shall be multiplied above the sand,</q> and yet He had said, <q>I will number them.</q> The very same who are numbered, <q>shall be multiplied above the sand.</q> For by Him is the sand numbered, by whom <q>the very hairs of our head are numbered.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185733"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;10:30</a></span> <q>I have risen, and yet am I with You.</q> Already have I suffered, says He, already have I been buried; lo! I have risen, and not yet do they understand that I am with them. <q>Yet am I with You,</q> that is, not yet with them, for not yet do they recognise Me. For thus do we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that after the resurrection of oar Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, when He appeared to them, they did not at once <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. There is another meaning also: <q>I have risen, and yet am I with You,</q> as though He would signify this present time, wherein He is as yet hidden at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, before He is revealed in the brightness, wherein He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>

<p>18. And then He tells what meanwhile, during this whole time when He already has risen, and remains still with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He suffers by the intermixture of sinners in His Body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by the separation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. <q>If Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall slay the sinners (since You shall say in Your thought, Depart from Me, you men of blood), they shall receive in vanity their cities</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->ver. 19-20). The words seem to be connected in this order; <q>If Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall slay the sinners, they shall receive in vanity their cities.</q> Thus are sinners slain, because, <q>having their understandings darkened, they are alienated from the life of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185734"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse18">Ephesians&nbsp;4:18</a></span> For on account of elation they lose confession, and so they are slain, and in them is fulfilled what <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Confession perishes from the dead, as from one that is not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185735"><a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse28">Sirach&nbsp;17:28</a></span> And so <q>they receive in vanity their cities,</q> that is, their vain peoples, who follow their vanity; when, puffed up by the name of righteousness, they  persuade men to burst the bond of unity, and blindly and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> follow them, as being more righteous....But now the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, says, Why do the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> against me, as though I were stained by other men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and so, by separating themselves, <q>receive in vanity their cities</q>? <q>Have not I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> You, Lord?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse21">Psalm 138:21</a></span>. Why do those who are worse themselves require of me to separate myself in body as well as spirit from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, so as to root up the wheat, together with the tares, before the time of harvest, that before the time of winnowing I lose my power of enduring the chaff; that before all the different sorts of fishes are brought to the end of the world, as to the shore, to be separated, I tear the nets of peace and unity? Are the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which I receive, those of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men? Do I; by consent, communicate in their life and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>?...But where is, <q>Love your enemies</q>? Is it because He said <q>yours,</q> not <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a></q>? <q>Do good to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185737"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> He says not, <q>who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> God.</q> So he follows the pattern, and says, <q>Have not I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> You; Lord?</q> He says not, <q>Who have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> me.</q> <q>And at Your enemies did I waste away.</q> <q>Yours,</q> he said, not <q>mine.</q> But those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us and are enemies unto us, only because we serve Him, what else do they but <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him, and are His enemies. Ought we then to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> such enemies as these? Or do not they suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for God's sake, to whom it is said, <q>Pray for them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you</q>? Observe then what follows. <q>With a perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> did I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse22">Psalm 138:22</a></span>. What is, <q>with a perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a></q>? I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> in them their iniquities, I loved Your creation. This it is to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> with a perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, that neither on account of the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> thou <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the men, nor on account of the men <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. For see what he adds, <q>They became mine enemies.</q> Not only as God's enemies, but as his own too does he now describe them. How then will he fulfil in them both his own saying, <q>Have not I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> those that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> You, Lord,</q> and the Lord's command, <q>Love your enemies</q>? How will he fulfil this, save with that <q>perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>,</q> that he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> in them that they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that they are men? For in the time even of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, when the carnal people was restrained by visible punishments, how did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who by understanding belonged to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, how did he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> sinners when he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them, or how did he not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them when he slew them, save that he <q><a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them with a perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a></q>? For with such perfection did he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the iniquity which he punished, as to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the manhood for which he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</p>

<p>19. Since then the Body of Christ is in the end to be severed in body also from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but now meanwhile groans among them, what does the <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ among the daughters, as the lily among thorns</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note185738"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:2</a></span> What are her words? What her <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? What is the <q>appearance of the king's daughter within</q>?  Lo, hear what she says. <q>Prove me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse23">Psalm 138:23</a></span>. Do Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Thou prove me, Thou <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; not man, not an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, who neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to prove, nor can <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my heart, whereas You prove, and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that I consent not to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, while they think that I can be defiled by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others; so that, while I in my long wandering do what I mourn in another Psalm, that is, while I <q>labour for peace among them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> peace,</q>  until I come to that Vision of peace, which is called Jerusalem, <q>which is the mother of us all,</q> the city <q><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> in the heavens;</q> they, contending, and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accusing and separating themselves, may <q>receive,</q> not, evidently, in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, but <q>in vanity, their cities.</q> Why this? Observe what follows.</p>

<p>20. <q>And see,</q> says he, <q>if there be any way of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in me, and lead me in the way everlasting</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa138.htm#verse24">Psalm 138:24</a></span>. <q>Search,</q> he says, <q>my paths,</q> that is, my counsels and thoughts. What else says he, but <q>lead me in Christ</q>? For who is <q>the way everlasting,</q> save He that is the life everlasting? For everlasting is He who said, <q>I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185741"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> If then you find anything in my way which displeases Your eyes, since my way is mortal, do Thou <q>lead me in the way everlasting,</q> wherein is no iniquity; for even <q>if any man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we have an Advocate with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the righteous; and He is the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185742"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:1-2</a></span> He is <q>the Way everlasting</q> without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; He is the Life everlasting without punishment.</p>

<p>21. These are great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, brethren. How does the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> speak with us? How does it make us delights in this night? What is this, we ask you, brethren, whence are they sweeter, the darker they are? He mixes us our potion after His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in certain wondrous ways. He makes His own sayings wondrous, so that while we were speaking what ye already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, yet forasmuch as it was dug out of passages which seemed obscure, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself seemed to be made new. Did ye not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren, that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are to be tolerated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and schisms not to be made? Did ye not already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that within those nets which hold both good and bad fishes, we must abide even to the shore, nor must the nets be burst, because on the shore the good shall be separated into vessels, and the bad thrown away? You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this already; but these verses of this Psalm ye did not understand; that which you did not understand is explained; that which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> has been renewed.</p>
