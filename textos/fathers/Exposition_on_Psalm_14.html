<h1>Exposition on Psalm 14</h1>


<p>To the end, a psalm of David himself.</p>

<p>1. What <q>to the end</q> means, must not be too often repeated. <q>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180484"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> as the Apostle says. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, when we begin to enter on the good road: we shall see Him, when we shall get to the end. And therefore is He the end.</p>

<p>2. <q>The fool has said in his heart, There is no God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa013.htm#verse1">Psalm 13:1</a></span>. For not even have certain <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> and abominable <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who entertain perverse and false notions of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, dared to say, <q>There is no God.</q> Therefore it is, has said <q>in his heart;</q> for that no one dares to say it, even if he has dared to think it. <q>They are corrupt, and become abominable in their affections:</q> that is, while they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> this world and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; these are the affections which corrupt the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and so blind it, that the fool can even say, <q>in his heart, There is no God. For as they did not like to retain God in their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, God gave them over to a reprobate mind.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180485"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;1:28</a></span> <q>There is none that does goodness, no not up to one.</q> <q>Up to one,</q> can be understood either with that one, so that no man be understood: or besides one, that the Lord Christ may be excepted. As we say, This field is up to the sea; we do not of course reckon the sea together with the field. And this is the better interpretation, so that none be understood to have done goodness up to Christ; for that no man can do goodness, except He shall have shown it. And that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for until a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he cannot do goodness.</p>

<p>3. <q>The Lord from heaven looked out upon the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to see if there be one understanding, or seeking after God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa013.htm#verse2">Psalm 13:2</a></span>. It may be interpreted, upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; as he may have given them the more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> name of the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by reason of their worship of the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in comparison with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; of whom I suppose it was said above, <q>The fool has said in his heart, There is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> etc. Now the Lord looks out, that He may see, by His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: which is the meaning of, <q>from heaven.</q> For by Himself nothing is hid from Him.</p>

<p>4. <q>All have gone out of the way, they have together become useless:</q> that is, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have become as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who were spoken of above. <q>There is none that does good, no not up to one</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa013.htm#verse3">Psalm 13:3</a></span>, must be interpreted as above. <q>Their throat is an open sepulchre.</q>  Either the voracity of the ever open palate is signified: or allegorically those who slay, and as it were devour those they have slain, into whom they instil the disorder of their own conversation. Like to which with the contrary meaning is that which was said to Peter, <q>Kill and eat;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180487"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;10:13</a></span> that he should convert the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and good conversation. <q>With their tongues they have dealt craftily.</q> Flattery is the companion of the greedy and of all bad men. <q>The poison of asps is under their lips.</q> By <q>poison,</q> he means deceit; and <q>of asps,</q> because they will not hear the precepts of the law, as asps <q>will not hear the voice of the charmer;</q>  which is said more clearly in another Psalm. <q>Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</q> this is, <q>the poison of asps.</q> <q>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</q> He here shows forth the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of ill doing. <q>Destruction and unhappiness</q> are <q>in their ways.</q> For all the ways of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men are full of toil and misery. Hence the Lord cries out, <q>Come unto Me, all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Take My yoke upon you, and learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. For My yoke is easy and My burden light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180489"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28-30</a></span> <q>And the way of peace have they not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>:</q> that way, namely, which the Lord, as I said, mentions, in the easy yoke and light burden. <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God before their eyes.</q> These do not say, <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> but yet they do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God.</p>

<p>5. <q>Shall not all, who work iniquity, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa013.htm#verse4">Psalm 13:4</a></span>. He threatens the judgment. <q>Who devour My people as the food of bread:</q> that is, daily. For the food of bread is daily food. Now they devour the people, who serve their own ends out of them, not referring their ministry to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those over whom they are.</p>

<p>6. <q>They have not called upon the Lord.</q> For he does not really call upon Him, who longs for such things as are displeasing to Him. <q>There they trembled for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, where no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> was</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa013.htm#verse5">Psalm 13:5</a></span>: that is, for the loss of things temporal. For they said, <q>If we let Him thus alone, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him; and the Romans will come, and take away both our place and nation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180490"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;11:48</a></span> They feared to lose an earthly kingdom, where no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> was; and they lost the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which they ought to have feared. And this must be understood of all temporal goods, the loss of which when men <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, they come not to things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>.</p>

<p>7. <q>For God is in the just generation.</q> It refers to what went before, so that the sense is, <q>shall not all they that work iniquity <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Lord is in the just generation;</q>  that is, He is not in them who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world. For it is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to leave the Maker of the worlds, and <q>serve the creature more than the Creator.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180492"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;1:25</a></span> You have shamed the counsel of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, for the Lord is his hope <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa013.htm#verse6">Psalm 13:6</a></span>: that is, you have despised the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> coming of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, because ye saw not in Him the pomp of the world: that they, whom he was calling, should put their hope in God alone, not in the things that pass away.</p>

<p>8. <q>Who will give <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of Sion?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa013.htm#verse7">Psalm 13:7</a></span>. Who but He whose humiliation you have despised? Is understood. For He will come in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the judgment of the quick and the dead, and the kingdom of the just: that, forasmuch as in that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> coming <q>blindness has happened in part unto <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might enter in,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180493"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;11:25</a></span> in that other should happen what follows, <q>and so all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> should be saved.</q> For the Apostle too takes that testimony of Isaiah, where it is said, <q>There shall come out of Sion He who shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180494"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;59:20</a></span> for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as it is here, <q>Who shall give <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of Sion?</q> <q>When the Lord shall turn away the captivity of His people, Jacob shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be glad.</q>  It is a repetition, as is usual: for I suppose, <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be glad,</q> is the same as, <q>Jacob shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</q></p>
