<h1>Exposition on Psalm 141</h1>


<p>1. ...The Psalm which we have just sung is in many parts somewhat obscure. When by the help of the Lord what has been said shall begin to be expounded and explained, you will see that you are hearing things which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> already. But for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> are they said in manifold ways, that variety of expression may remove all weariness of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>....</p>

<p>2. <q>Lord, I have cried unto You, hear Thou me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse1">Psalm 140:1</a></span>. This we all can say. This not I alone say: whole Christ says it. But it is said rather in the name of the Body: for He too, when He was here and bore our flesh, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>; and when He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, drops of blood streamed down from His whole Body. So is it written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Jesus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> earnestly, and His sweat was as it were great drops of blood.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185764"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;22:44</a></span> What is this flowing of sweat from His whole Body, but the suffering of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> from the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? <q>Listen unto the voice of my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, while I cry unto You.</q> You thought the business of crying already finished, when you said, <q>I have cried unto You.</q> You have cried; yet think not yourself safe. If tribulation be finished, crying is finished: but if tribulation remain for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even to the end of the world, let it not only say, <q>I have cried unto You,</q> but also, <q>Listen unto the voice of my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</q></p>

<p>3. <q>Let my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be set forth in Your sight as <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and the lifting up of my hands an evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse2">Psalm 140:2</a></span>. That this is wont to be understood of the Head Himself, every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> acknowledges. For when the day was now sinking towards evening, the Lord upon the Cross <q>laid down His life to take it again,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185765"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;10:17</a></span> did not lose it against His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Still we too are figured there. For what of Him hung upon the tree, save what He took of us? And how can it be that the Father should leave and abandon His only begotten Son, especially when He is one God with Him? Yet, fixing our weakness upon the Cross, where, as the Apostle says, <q>our old man is crucified with Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185766"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;6:6</a></span> He cried out in the voice of that our <q>old man,</q> <q>Why have You forsaken Me?</q>  That then is the <q>evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q> the Passion of the Lord, the Cross of the Lord, the offering of a salutary Victim, the whole burnt offering acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That <q>evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a></q> produced, in His Resurrection, a morning offering. Prayer then, purely directed from a faithful heart, rises like <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> from a hallowed altar. Nought is more delightful than the odour of the Lord: such odour let all have who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>4. ...<q>Set, O Lord, a watch before my mouth, and a door of restraint around my lips</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse3">Psalm 140:3</a></span>. He said not a barrier of restraint, but <q>a door of restraint.</q> A door is opened as well as shut. If then it be a <q>door,</q> let it be both opened and shut; opened, to confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; closed, to excusing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. So will it be a <q>door of restraint,</q> not of ruin. For what does this <q>door of restraint</q> profit us? What does Christ <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the name of His Body? <q>That Thou turn not aside My heart to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> words</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse4">Psalm 140:4</a></span>. What is, <q>My heart</q>? The heart of My Church; the heart, that is, of My Body....</p>

<p>5. But when your heart has not been turned aside, O member of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when your heart has not been turned aside <q>to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> words, to making excuses in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, with men that work in iniquity,</q> you shall also not unite with their elect. For this follows, <q>And I will not unite with their elect.</q> Who are <q>their elect</q>? Those who justify themselves. Who are their elect? Those <q>who trust in themselves that they are righteous, and despise others,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> said in the temple, <q>Lord, I thank You that I am not as other men are.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185768"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;18:11</a></span> Who are their elect? <q>This Man, if He were a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what manner of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> this is that touched His feet.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185769"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;7:39</a></span> Here you recognise the words of that other <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, who invited our Lord to his house; when the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of that city, who was a sinner, came and approached His Feet....</p>

<p>For even this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> herself, <q>if her heart had turned aside to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> words,</q> would not have lacked wherewith to defend her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Do not <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> daily, her equals in defilement, but not her equals in confession, harlots, adulteresses, doers of shameful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, defend their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? If they have not been seen, they deny them: if they have been caught and convicted, or have done their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> openly, they defend them. And how easy is their defence, how ready, yet how headlong; how common, yet how <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>! <q>Had God not willed it, I had not done it: God willed it: fortune willed it: <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> willed it.</q>...These are the defences of <q>the elect</q> of this world. But let the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, say, let Christ say in the name of His Body, <q>Turn not Thou aside, My Heart, to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> words,</q> etc., <q>and I will not unite with their elect.</q>...</p>

<p>6. <q>With men that work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> What <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? Let me mention some sinful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of theirs. Let me tell you one open sinful <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, which they acknowledge. They say, it is better for a man to be an usurer than a husbandman. Thou ask the reason, and they assign one....He vexes the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who cleanses the earth with a furrow: he vexes the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who pulls grass from the earth: he vexes the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who plucks an apple from a tree. To avoid committing their imaginary murders in the farm, he commits real murders in <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>. He deals no bread to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>. See whether there can be greater unrighteousness than this righteousness.  He deals not bread to the hungry. You ask, why? Lest the beggar receive the life which is in the bread, which they call a member of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bind it in flesh. What then are you doing? Why do you eat? Have you not flesh? Yes; but we, they say, forasmuch as we are enlightened by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Manes,  by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and our Psalms, forasmuch as we are elect, we cleanse thereby that bread, and transmit it into the treasure-house of the heavens. Such are the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, that they are not to be saved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but saviours of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is Christ, they say, crucified in the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. I received in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> Christ a Saviour, but you are in your books the saviours of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Plainly you are <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and therefore not to be saved by Christ. Therefore lest a crumb be given to the hungry, and in the crumb a member of Christ suffer, is the hungry to die of hunger? False mercy to a crumb causes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. But who are their elect? <q>Turn not thou aside, my heart, to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> words, and I will not unite with their elect.</q></p>

<p>7. <q>The righteous One shall amend me in mercy, and convict me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse5">Psalm 140:5</a></span>. Behold the sinner confessing. He desires to be amended in mercy, rather than praised deceitfully....<q>Shall convict me,</q> but <q>in mercy:</q> shall convict, yet <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> not: yea, shall all the more convict, because He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> not. And why does he therefore give thanks? Because, <q>rebuke a wise man, and he will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185772"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse8">Proverbs&nbsp;9:8</a></span> <q>The righteous One shall amend me.</q> Because He persecutes you? God forbid. He requires rather amending himself, who amends in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>. Wherefore then does He amend? <q>In mercy. And shall convict me.</q> Wherein? <q>In mercy. For the oil of a sinner shall not enrich my head.</q> My head shall not grow by flattery. Undue praise is flattery: undue praise of a flatterer is <q>the oil of a sinner.</q> Therefore men too, when they have mocked any one with false praise, say, <q>I have anointed his head.</q> Love then to be <q>convicted by the righteous One in mercy;</q> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not to be praised by a sinner in mockery. Have oil in yourselves, and you shall not seek the <q>oil of a sinner.</q>. ..</p>

<p>8. You say to me, What am I doing? I am beset with flatterers; they cease not to besiege me; they praise in me what I would not, that praise in me what I hold in little esteem; what I hold dear they blame in me; flatterers, treacherous, deceivers. For instance, <q>Gaiuseius  is a great man, great, learned, wise; but why is he a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? For great is his learning, great his reading, great his wisdom.</q> If great is his wisdom, approve of his being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; if great his learning, learnedly has he chosen. In fine, what you revile, that pleases him whom you praise. But what? That praise sweetens not: it is <q>the oil of a sinner.</q> Yet ceases he not to speak so. Let him not therewith <q>fatten your head;</q> that is, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> not in such things; agree not to such things; consent not to such things; <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> not in such things; and then, if he have applied to you the oil of flattery, yet has your head remained as it was, it has not been puffed up, it has not swollen....<q>For still shall My word be well-pleasing to them.</q> Wait awhile: now they revile Me, says Christ. In the early times of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were blamed on all sides. Wait as yet; and <q>My word shall be well-pleasing to them.</q> The time shall come when they shall conquer thousands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who shall beat their breasts, and say, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</q> Even now, how many remain who blush to beat their breasts? Let them then blame us: let us bear it. Let them blame; let them <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, accuse, detract; <q>still shall My word be well-pleasing to them;</q> the time shall come when My word shall please them....O wordy defence of iniquity! Verily now whole nations say this, and the thunder of nations beating their breasts ceases not. Rightly do the clouds thunder, wherein now God dwells. Where is now that wordiness, where that boasting, <q>I am righteous; nought of ill have I done</q>? Verily, when you have contemplated in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> the law of righteousness, how far soever you have advanced, you shall find yourself a sinner....What sort of man am I now speaking of, brethren? I speak of him who worships God alone, who confesses Christ, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to be one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who commits not fornication against Him; who worships not devils; who seeks him not aid from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; who holds the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; whom no one complains of as cheating; under whose oppression no weak neighbour groans; who assails not another's wife; who is content with his own, or even without his own, in such wise as is lawful, and as Apostolical discipline permits, with consent of both, <span class="stiki" id="note185775"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:5</a></span> or when she is not yet married. Even he who is such as this, is yet overtaken in such things as I have mentioned. For all these daily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> then what is our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, save to say with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> heart in the Lord's Prayer, while we defend not our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but confess them, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185776"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> and to <q>have an Advocate with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the righteous,</q> that He may be <q>the propitiation for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note185777"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:1-2</a></span> See what follows: <q>their judges have been swallowed up beside the Rock</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse6">Psalm 140:6</a></span>. What is, <q>swallowed up beside the Rock? That Rock was Christ. <span class="stiki" id="note185778"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> They have been swallowed up beside the Rock.</q> <q>Beside,</q> that is, compared, as judges, as mighty, powerful, learned: they are called <q>their judges,</q> as judging about morals, and laying down their opinions. This Aristotle said. Set him beside the Rock, and he is swallowed up. Who is Aristotle? Let him hear, <q>Christ has said,</q> and he trembles among the dead. This Pythagoras said, that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> said. Set them beside the Rock, compare their authority to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, compare the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> to the Crucified. Say we to them <q>You have written your words in the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>; He has planted His Cross in the hearts  of kings: finally, He died, and rose again; you are dead, and I will not ask how ye rise again.</q> So <q>their judges have been swallowed up beside</q> that <q>Rock.</q> So long do their words seem somewhat, till they are compared with the Rock. Therefore if any of them be found to have said what Christ too has said, we congratulate him, but we follow him not. But he came before Christ. If any man speak what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is he therefore before the Truth itself? Regard Christ, O man, not when He came to you, but when He made you. The sick man too might say, <q>But I took to my bed before the physician came to me.</q> Why, for that very reason has He come last, because you first have sickened.</p>

<p>9. <q>They shall hear My Words, for they have prevailed.</q> My Words have prevailed over their words. They have spoken clever things, I <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> things. To praise one who talks well is one thing, to praise One who speaks <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is another. <q>They shall hear My Words, for they have prevailed.</q> How have they prevailed? Who of them has been taken offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, when such things were forbidden by the law, and has not denied it? Who of them has been taken worshipping an idol, and has not exclaimed, <q>I did it not,</q> and feared lest he should be convicted? Such servants has the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But how have the Words of the Lord prevailed? <q>Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves. Fear not those who kill the body,</q> etc.  He gave them <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, He suggested hope, He kindled <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <q>Fear not death,</q> He says. Do ye <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death? I die first. Fear ye, lest a hair of your head perish? I first rise again in the flesh uninjured. Rightly have ye heard His Words, for they have prevailed. They spoke, and were slain; they fell, and yet stood. And what was the result of so many deaths of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, save that those words prevailed, and the earth being, so to speak, watered by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> witnesses, the cross of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shot up everywhere? How have they <q>prevailed</q>? We have said already, when they were preached by men who feared not. Feared not what? Neither banishment, nor losses, nor death, nor crucifixion: for it was not death alone that they did not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; but even crucifixion, a death than which none was thought more accursed. It the Lord endured, that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> might not only not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death, but not even that kind of death. When then these things are said by men that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not, they have prevailed.</p>

<p>10. What then have all those deaths of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> accomplished? Listen: <q>As the fatness of the earth is spread over the earth, our bones have been scattered beside the pit</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse7">Psalm 140:7</a></span>. <q>The bones</q> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, that is, the bodies of the witnesses of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were slain, and they who slew them seemed to prevail. They prevailed by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, that the words of Christ might prevail by preaching. And what was the result of the deaths of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? What means, <q>the fatness of the earth is spread over the earth</q>? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that everything that is refuse is the fatness of the earth. The things which are, as it were, contemptible to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, enrich the earth....<q>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q>  As it is contemptible to the world, so is it precious to the husbandman. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the use thereof, and its rich juice; he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what he desires, what he seeks, whence the fertile crop arises; but this world despises it. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has chosen the contemptible things of the world, and those which are not, like as those which are, that the things which are may be brought to nought</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note185782"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:27-28</a></span> From the dunghill was Peter lifted up, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; when they were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, they were despised: now, the earth having been enriched by them, and the cross of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> springing up, behold, all that is noble and chief in the world, even the emperor himself, comes to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and whither does he hasten? To the temple of the emperor, or the memorial of the fisherman?</p>

<p>11. <q>For unto You, Lord, are my eyes; in You have I hoped, take not Thou away my life</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse8">Psalm 140:8</a></span>. For they were tortured in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, and many failed. It occurs to him that many have failed, many have been in hazard, and as it were in the midst of the tribulation of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> is sent forth the voice of one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>; <q>For unto You, Lord, are my eyes:</q> I care not what they threaten who stand around, <q>unto You, Lord, are my eyes.</q> More do I fix my eye on Your promises than on their threats. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what You have suffered for me, what You have promised me.</p>

<p>12. <q>Keep me from the trap which they have laid for me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse9">Psalm 140:9</a></span>. What was the trap? <q>If you consent, I spare you.</q> In the trap was set the bait of the present life; if the bird <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> this bait, it falls into the trap: but if the bird be able to say, <q>The day of man have I not desired: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185783"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse16">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:16</a></span> <q>He shall pluck his feet out of the net,</q> etc.  Two things he has mentioned to be distinguished the one from the other: the trap he said was set by persecutors; the stumbling-blocks came from those who have consented and apostatised: and from both he desires to be guarded. On the one side they threaten and rage, on the other consent and fall: I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the one be such, that I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> him; the other such, that I imitate him. <q>This I do to you, if you consent not.</q> <q>Keep me from the trap,</q> etc. <q>Behold, your brother has already consented.</q> <q>And from the stumbling-blocks,</q> etc.</p>

<p>13. <q>Sinners shall fall into his nets</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa140.htm#verse10">Psalm 140:10</a></span>. Not all sinners, certain sinners, who are so great sinners, as to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> this life to such a degree as to prefer it to everlasting life, <q>shall fall into his trap.</q> But what do you say? Shall they that are such, do you think, fall into his nets? What of Your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, O Christ? Behold, when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was raging, when they all <q>left You alone, and went every one to his own:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185785"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;16:32</a></span> lo! They who were closest to You, in Your trial and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, when Your enemies demanded You to be crucified, abandoned You. And that bold one, who had promised You that he would go with You even unto death, heard from the Physician what was being done in him, the sick man. For being in a fever, he had said he was whole; but the Lord touched the vein of his heart. Then came the trial; then came the test; then came the accusation; and now, questioned not by some great power, but by a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> slave, and that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, questioned by a handmaid, he yielded; he denied thrice....<q>He wept bitterly,</q> it says. Not yet was he fitted to suffer. To him was said, <q>You shall follow Me afterwards.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185786"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;13:36</a></span> Hereafter he was to be firm, having been strengthened by the Lord's Resurrection. Not yet then was it time that those <q>bones</q> should be <q>scattered beside the pit.</q> For see how many failed, even to those who first hung on His mouth; even they failed. Wherefore? <q>I am alone, until I pass over:</q> for this follows in the Psalm....</p>

<p>14. Pascha, as they say who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and who have explained to us what to read, means <q><a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>.</q> When then the Lord's Passion was about to come, the Evangelist, as though he would use this very word, says, <q>When the hour had come that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should <em>pass over</em> to the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185787"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;13:1</a></span> We hear then of Pascha in this verse, <q>I am alone, until I pass over.</q> After Pascha I shall no longer be alone, after passing-over I shall no longer be alone. Many shall imitate Me, many shall follow Me. And if afterward they shall follow, what shall be the case now? <q>I am alone, until I pass over.</q> What is it that the Lord says in this Psalm, <q>I am alone, until I pass over</q>? What is it that we have expounded? If we have understood it, listen to His own words in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit.</q>. ..Therefore He was alone before He was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>....So far was any from dying for the Name, that is, for confessing the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, before that Corn of wheat fell into the ground, that even John, who was slain just before Him, being given by a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> king to a dancing <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, was not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> because he confessed Christ. Of course he might have been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> for this, and that by many. If for another reason he was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by one man, how much more might he have been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by those very men, who put Christ to death? For John gave testimony to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. They who heard Christ, wished to slay Him; the man who gave testimony to Him they slew not....He is not slain by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who gave free testimony to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> slew; he is slain by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, because he said to him, <q>It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185789"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;14:4</a></span> For his brother had not died without issue.  For the law of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for equity, for righteousness' sake, he did die: therefore is he a saint, therefore a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; but yet he died not for that Name whereby we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, wherefore, save that the saying might be fulfilled, <q>I am alone, until I pass over.</q></p>
