<h1>Exposition on Psalm 144</h1>


<p>1. The title of this Psalm is brief in number of words, but heavy in the weight of its <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. <q>To David himself against Goliath.</q> This battle was fought in the time of our fathers, and you, beloved, remember it with me from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>....David put five stones in his scrip, he hurled but one. The five Books were chosen, but unity conquered. Then, having smitten and overthrown him, he took the enemy's sword, and with it cut off his head. This our David also did, He overthrew the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with his own weapons: and when his great ones, whom he had in his power, by means of whom he slew other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, they turn their tongues against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and so Goliath's head is cut off with his own sword.</p>

<p>2. <q>Blessed be the Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who teaches my hands for battle, my fingers for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse1">Psalm 143:1</a></span>. These are our words, if we be the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It seems a repetition of sentiment; <q>our hands for battle,</q> and <q>our fingers for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>,</q> are the same. Or is there some difference between <q>hands</q> and <q>fingers</q>? Certainly both hands and fingers work. Not then without reason do we take <q>fingers</q> as put for <q>hands.</q> But still in the <q>fingers</q> we recognise the division of operation, yet still a sort of unity. Behold that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>! The Apostle says,  To one, this; to another, that; <q>there are diversities of operations; all these works one and the self-same Spirit;</q> there is the root of unity. With these <q>fingers</q> then the Body of Christ fights, going forth to <q><a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>,</q> going forth to <q>battle.</q>...By works of Mercy our enemy is conquered, and we could not have works of mercy unless we had charity, and charity we could have none unless we received it by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; He then <q>teaches our hands for battle, and our fingers for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>:</q> to Him rightfully do we say, <q>My Mercy,</q> from whom we have also that we are merciful: <q>for he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185840"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James&nbsp;2:13</a></span> </p>

<p>3. My Mercy and my Refuge, my Upholder and my Deliverer <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse2">Psalm 143:2</a></span>. Much toils this combatant, having his flesh lusting against his spirit. Keep what you have. Then shall you have in full what you wish, when <q>death shall have been swallowed up in victory;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185841"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:54</a></span> when this mortal body has been raised, and is changed into the condition of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and rises aloft to a heavenly quality....There is life, there are good days, where nought <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit, where it is not said, <q>Fight,</q> but <q>Rejoice.</q> But who is he that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> for these days? Every man certainly says, <q>I do.</q> Hear what follows. I see that you are toiling, I see that you are engaged in battle, and in danger; hear what follows:...<q>Depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do good:</q> let not the poor first weep under you, that the poor may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> through you. For what reward, since now you are fighting? <q>Seek peace, and ensue it.</q> Learn and say, <q>My Mercy and my Refuge, mine Upholder and my Deliverer, my Protector:</q> <q>mine Upholder,</q> lest I fall; <q>my Deliverer,</q> lest I stick; <q>my Protector,</q> lest I be stricken. In all these things, in all my toil, in all my battles, in all my difficulties, in Him have I hoped, <q>who subdues my people under me.</q> Behold, our Head speaks together with us.</p>

<p>4. <q>Lord, what is man, that You have become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto him?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse3">Psalm 143:3</a></span>. All is included in <q>that You have become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto him.</q> <q>Or the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, that Thou valuest him?</q> Thou valuest him, that is, You make him of such importance, You count him of such price, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> under what Thou placest him, over what Thou placest him. For valuing is considering the price of a thing. How greatly did He value man, who for him shed the blood of His only-begotten Son! For God values not man in the same way as one man values another: he, when he finds a slave for sale, gives a higher price for a horse than for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. Consider how greatly He valued you, that you may be able to say, <q>If God be for us, who can be against us?</q> And how greatly did He value you, <q>who spared not His own Son</q>? <q>How shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185842"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse31">Romans&nbsp;8:31-32</a></span> He who gives this food to the combatant, what keeps He in store for the conqueror?...</p>

<p>5. <q>Man is made like vanity: his days pass away like a shadow</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse4">Psalm 143:4</a></span>. What vanity? Time, which passes on, and flows by. For this <q>vanity</q> is said in comparison of the Truth, which ever abides, and never fails: for it too is a work of His Hand, in its degree. <q>For,</q> as it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> filled the earth with His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185843"><a href="../bible/sir016.htm#verse29">Sirach&nbsp;16:29</a></span> What is <q>His</q>? That accord with Him. But all these things, being earthly, fleeting, transitory, if they be compared to that Truth, where it is said, <q>I Am That I Am,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185844"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> all this which passes away is called <q>vanity.</q> For through time it vanishes, like stroke into the air. And why should I say more than that which the Apostle James said, willing to bring down <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> men to humility, <q>What is,</q> says he, <q>your life? It is even a vapour, which appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185845"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse14">James&nbsp;4:14</a></span> ...Work then, though it be in the night, with your hands, that is, by good works seek <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before the day come which shall gladden you, lest the day come which shall sadden you. For see how safely you work, who art not left by Him whom you seek, <q>that your Father which sees in secret may reward you openly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185846"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;6:4</a></span> ...</p>

<p>6. <q>Lord, bow Your heavens, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse5">Psalm 143:5</a></span>. <q>Flash Your lightning, and You shall scatter them; send forth Your arrows, and You shall confound them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse6">Psalm 143:6</a></span>. <q>Send forth Your Hand from above, and deliver me, and draw me out of many waters</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse7">Psalm 143:7</a></span>. The Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> David, full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, relying on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fighting in this world, calls for the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What are <q>heavens bowed down</q>? Apostles humbled. For those <q>heavens declare the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and of these heavens declaring the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God it is presently said, <q>There is neither speech nor language, but their voices are heard among them,</q> etc.  When then these heavens sent forth their voices through all lands, and did wonderful things, while the Lord flashed and thundered from them by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and commandments, the gods were thought to have come down from heaven to men. For certain of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, thinking this, desired even to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to them....But they commended to these the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, humbling themselves, that God might be praised; because <q>the heavens</q> were <q>bowed,</q> that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></q> might <q>come down.</q>...<q>Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</q> So long as they are not touched, they seem to themselves great: they are now about to say, <q>Great are You, O Lord:</q>  the mountains also are about to say, <q>Thou only art the Most Highest over all the earth.</q> </p>

<p>7. But there are some that conspire, that <q>gather themselves together against the Lord, and against His Christ.</q>  They have come together, they have conspired. <q>Flash forth Your lightnings, and You shall scatter them.</q> Abound with Your <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and their conspiracy shall be broken....<q>Send forth Your arrows, and You shall confound them.</q> Let the unsound be wounded, that, being well wounded, they may be made sound; and let them say, being set now in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let them say with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <q>I am wounded with Love.</q>  <q>Send forth Your Hand from on high.</q> What afterward? What in the end? How conquers the Body of Christ? By heavenly aid. <q>For the Lord Himself shall come with the voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God shall He descend from heaven,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185852"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> Himself the Saviour of the body, the Hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What is, <q>Out of many waters</q>? From many peoples. What peoples? Aliens, unbelievers, whether assailing us from without, or laying snares within. Take me out of many waters, in which You disciplined me, in which You rolled me, to free me from my filth. This is the <q>water of contradiction.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185853"><a href="../bible/num020.htm#verse13">Numbers&nbsp;20:13</a></span> ...<q>From the hand of strange children.</q> Hear, brethren, among whom we are, among whom we live, from whom we long to be delivered. <q>Whose mouth has spoken vanity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse8">Psalm 143:8</a></span>. All of you today, if you had not gathered yourselves together to these divine shows  of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and were not at this hour engaged in them, how great vanities would ye be hearing! <q>whose mouth has spoken vanity:</q> when, in short, would they, speaking vanity, hear you speaking vanity? <q>And their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.</q> What doest thou among them with your pastoral scrip with five stones in it? Say it to me in another form: that same law which you have signified by five stones, signify in some other way also. <q>I will sing a new song unto You, O God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse9">Psalm 143:9</a></span>. <q>A new song</q> is of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; <q>a new song</q> is of the new man; <q>a new song</q> is of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. But lest you should think that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> departs from the law, whereas rather by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the law is fulfilled, <q>upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing unto You.</q> Upon the law of ten commandments: therein may I sing to You; therein may I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to You; therein may <q>I sing to You a new song;</q> for, <q>Love is the fulfilling of the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185855"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> But they who have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> may carry the psaltery, sing they cannot. Contradiction cannot make my psaltery to be silent.</p>

<p>8. <q>Who gives <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to kings, who redeems David His servant</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse10">Psalm 143:10</a></span>. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who David is; be yourselves David. Whence <q>redeems He David His servant</q>? Whence redeems He Christ? Whence redeems He the Body of Christ? <q>From the sword of ill intent deliver me.</q> <q>From the sword</q> is not sufficient; he adds, <q>of ill intent.</q> Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> there is a sword of good intent. What is the sword of good intent? That whereof the Lord says, <q>I came not to send peace on earth, but a sword.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note185856"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> For He was about to separate <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> from unbelievers, sons from <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and to sever all other ties, while the sword cut off what was diseased, but healed the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Of good intent then is the sword twice sharpened, powerful with both edges, the Old and New Testaments, with the narration of the past and the promise of the future. That then is the sword of good intent: but the other is of ill intent, wherewith they talk vanity, for that is of good intent, wherewith God speaks verity. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <q>the sons of men have teeth which are spears and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword.</q>  <q>From</q> this <q>sword deliver me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse11">Psalm 143:11</a></span>. <q>And take me out of the hand of strange children, whose mouth has spoken vanity:</q> just as before. And that which follows, <q>their right hand is a right hand of iniquity,</q> the same he had set down before also, when he called them <q>many waters.</q> For lest you should think that the <q>many waters</q> were good waters, he explained them by the <q>sword of ill intent.</q></p>

<p>9. <q>Whose sons are like young vines firmly planted in their youth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse12">Psalm 143:12</a></span>. He wishes to recount their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. Observe, you sons of light, sons of peace: observe, you sons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, members of Christ; observe whom he calls <q>strangers,</q> whom he calls <q>strange children,</q> whom he calls <q>waters of contradiction,</q> whom he calls a <q>sword of ill intent.</q> Observe, I beseech you, for among them you are in peril, among their tongues ye fight against the desires of your flesh, among their tongues, set in the hand of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> wherewith he fights. <span class="stiki" id="note185858"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> ...What vanity has their mouth spoken, and how is their right hand a right hand of iniquity? <q>Their daughters are fitted and adorned after the similitude of a temple.</q> <q>Their garners are full, bursting out from one store to another: their sheep are fruitful, multiplying in their streets</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse13">Psalm 143:13</a></span>: <q>their oxen are fat: their hedge is not broken down, nor their road, nor is their crying in their streets</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse14">Psalm 143:14</a></span>. Is not this then <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>? I ask the sons of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, I ask the offspring of everlasting resurrection, I ask the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Is not this then <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, to have sons safe, daughters beautiful, garners full, cattle abundant, no downfall, I say not of a wall, but not even of a hedge, no tumult and clamour in the streets, but quiet, peace, abundance, plenty of all things in their houses and in their cities? Is not this then <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>? Or ought the righteous to shun it? Or do you not find the house of the righteous too abounding with all these things, full of this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>? Did not <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> house abound with gold, silver, children, servants, cattle? What say we? Is not this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>? Be it so, still it is on the left hand. What is, on the left hand? Temporal, mortal, bodily. I desire not that thou shun it, but that thou think it not to be on the right hand....For what ought they to have set on the right hand? <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, the years of God which fail not, whereof is said, <q>and Your years shall not fail.</q>  There should be the right hand, there should be our longing. Let us use the left for the time, let us long for the fight for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. <q>If riches increase, set not your heart upon them.</q>. ..</p>

<p>10. <q>They have called the people blessed who have these things</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa143.htm#verse15">Psalm 143:15</a></span>. O men that speak vanity! They have lost the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> right hand, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and perverse, they have put on the benefits of God inversely. O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ones, O speakers of vanity, O strange children! What was on the left hand, they have set on the right. What do you, David? What do you, Body of Christ? What do ye, members of Christ? What do ye, not strange children, but children of God?...What do you say? Say ye with us, <q>Blessed is the people whose Lord is their God.</q></p>
