<h1>Exposition on Psalm 15</h1>


<p>A psalm of David himself.</p>

<p>1. Touching this title there is no question. <q>O Lord who shall sojourn in Your tabernacle?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa014.htm#verse1">Psalm 14:1</a></span>. Although tabernacle be sometimes used even for an everlasting habitation: yet when tabernacle is taken in its proper meaning, it is a thing of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. Hence soldiers are called tent-fellows,  as having their tents together. This sense is assisted by the words, <q>Who shall sojourn?</q> For we <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> for a time, and then we need a tabernacle wherein we may refresh ourselves. Which specially points out the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the temporal Dispensation, which was wrought for us in time through the Incarnation of the Lord. <q>And who shall rest in Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain?</q> Here perhaps he signifies at once the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> habitation itself, <span class="stiki" id="note180498"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:1-2</a></span> that we should understand by <q>mountain</q> the supereminence of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ in life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. </p>

<p>2. <q>He who walks without stain, and works righteousness</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa014.htm#verse2">Psalm 14:2</a></span>. Here he has laid down the proposition; in what follows he sets it forth in detail.</p>

<p>3. <q>Who speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in his heart.</q> For some have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on their lips, and not in their heart. As if one should deceitfully point out a road, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that there were <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> there, and should say, If you go this way, you will be safe from <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>; and it should turn out that in fact there were no <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> found there: he has spoken the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but not in his heart. For he supposed it to be otherwise, and spoke the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Therefore it is not enough to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, unless it be so also in heart. <q>Who has practised no deceit in his tongue</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa014.htm#verse3">Psalm 14:3</a></span>. Deceit is practised with the tongue, when one thing is professed with the mouth, another concealed in the breast. <q>Nor done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to his neighbour.</q> It is well known that by <q>neighbour,</q> every man should be understood.  <q>And has not entertained <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> against his neighbour,</q> that is, has not readily or rashly given credence to an accuser.</p>

<p>4. <q>The malicious one has been brought to nought in his sight</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa014.htm#verse4">Psalm 14:4</a></span>. This is perfection, that the malicious one have no force against a man; and that this be <q>in his sight;</q> that is, that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> most surely that the malicious is not, save when the mind turns itself away from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and immutable form  of her own Creator to the form of the creature, which was made out of nothing. <q>But those that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, He <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorifies</a>:</q> the Lord Himself, that is. Now <q>the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.</q>  As then the things above belong to the perfect, so what he is now going to say belongs to beginners.</p>

<p>5. <q>Who swears unto his neighbour, and deceives him not.</q> <q>Who has not given his money upon <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>, and has not taken rewards against the innocent</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa014.htm#verse5">Psalm 14:5</a></span>. These are no great things: but he who is not able to do even this, much less able is he to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in his heart, and to practise no deceit in his tongue, but as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is in the heart, so to profess and have it in his mouth, <q>yea, yea; nay, nay;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180503"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;5:37</a></span> and to do no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to his neighbour, that is, to any man; and to entertain no <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> against his neighbour: all which are the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the perfect, in whose sight the malicious one has been brought to nought. Yet he concludes even these lesser things thus, <q>Whoso does these things shall not be moved for ever:</q> that is, he shall attain unto those greater things, wherein is great and unshaken stability. For even the very tenses are, perhaps not without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so varied, as that in the conclusion above the past tense should be used, but in this the future. For there it was said, <q>The malicious one has been brought to nought in his sight:</q> but here, <q>shall not be moved for ever.</q></p>
