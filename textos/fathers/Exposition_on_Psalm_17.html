<h1>Exposition on Psalm 17</h1>


<p>A <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of David himself.</p>

<p>1. This <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> must be assigned to the Person of the Lord, with the addition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is His body.</p>

<p>2. <q>Hear My righteousness, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, consider My supplication</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse1">Psalm 16:1</a></span>. <q>Hearken unto My <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, not in deceitful lips:</q> not going forth to You in deceitful lips. <q>Let My judgment from Your countenance go forth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse2">Psalm 16:2</a></span>. From the enlightening of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of You, let Me judge <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Or at least, let My judgment go forth, not in deceitful lips, from Your countenance, that is, that I may not in judging utter anything else than I understand in You. <q>Let My eyes see equity:</q> the eyes, of course, of the heart.</p>

<p>3. <q>You have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and visited Mine heart in the night-season</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse3">Psalm 16:3</a></span>. For this Mine heart has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the visitation of tribulation. <q>You have examined Me by fire, and iniquity has not been found in Me.</q> Now not night only, in that it is wont to disturb, but fire also, in that it burns, is this tribulation to be called; whereby when I was examined I was found righteous.</p>

<p>4. <q>That My mouth may not speak the works of men</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse4">Psalm 16:4</a></span>. That nothing may proceed out of My mouth, but what relates to Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and praise; not to the works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which they do beside Your will. <q>Because of the words of Your lips.</q>  Because of the words of Your peace, or of Your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. <q>I have kept hard ways.</q> I have kept the toilsome ways of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mortality and suffering.</p>

<p>5. <q>To perfect My steps in Your paths</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse5">Psalm 16:5</a></span>. That the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> might be perfected in the strait ways, whereby she arrives at Your rest. <q>That My footsteps be not moved.</q> That the signs of My way, which, like footsteps, have been imprinted on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> and Apostolical writings, be not moved, that they may mark them who would follow Me. Or at least, that I may still abide fixedly in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, after that I have accomplished the hard ways, and have finished My steps in the straits of Your paths.</p>

<p>6. <q>I have cried out, for You have heard Me, O God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse6">Psalm 16:6</a></span>. With a free and strong effort have I directed My <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> unto You: for that I might have this power, You have heard Me when <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> more weakly. <q>Incline Your ear to Me, and hear My words.</q> Let not Your hearing forsake My humiliation.</p>

<p>7. <q>Make Your mercies marvellous</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse7">Psalm 16:7</a></span>. Let not Your mercies be disesteemed, lest they be loved too little.</p>

<p>8. <q>Who savest them that hope in You from such as resist Your right hand:</q> from such as resist the favour, whereby You favour Me. <q>Keep Me, O Lord, as the apple of Your eye</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse8">Psalm 16:8</a></span>: which seems very little and minute: yet by it is the sight of the eye directed, whereby the light is distinguished from the darkness; as by Christ's humanity, the divinity of the Judgment  distinguishing between the righteous and sinners. <q>In the covering of Your wings protect Me.</q> In the defence of Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and mercy protect Me. <q>From the face of the ungodly who have troubled Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse9">Psalm 16:9</a></span>.</p>

<p>9. <q>Mine enemies have compassed about My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;</q> <q>they have shut up their own fat</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse10">Psalm 16:10</a></span>. They have been covered with their own gross <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, after that their desire has been satiated with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. <q>Their mouth has spoken <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</q> And therefore their mouth spoke <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, in saying, <q>Hail, King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180516"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;27:29</a></span> and other like words.</p>

<p>10. <q>Casting Me forth they have now compassed Me about</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse11">Psalm 16:11</a></span>. Casting Me forth outside the city, they have now compassed Me about on the Cross. <q>Their eyes they have determined to turn down on the earth.</q> The bent of their heart they have determined to turn down on these earthly things: deeming Him, who was slain, to endure a mighty <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and themselves, that slew Him, none.</p>

<p>11. <q>As a lion ready for prey, have they taken Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse12">Psalm 16:12</a></span>. They have taken Me, like that adversary who <q>walks about, seeking whom he may devour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180517"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> <q>And as a lion's cub dwelling in secret places.</q> And as his cub, the people to whom it was said, <q>You are of your father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180518"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> meditating on the snares, whereby they might circumvent and destroy the just One.</p>

<p>12. <q>Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse13">Psalm 16:13</a></span>. Arise, O Lord, Thou whom they suppose to be asleep, and regardless of men's iniquities; be they blinded before by their own <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, that vengeance may prevent their deed; and so cast them down.</p>

<p>13. <q>Deliver My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the ungodly.</q> Deliver My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by restoring Me after the death, which the ungodly have inflicted on Me. <q>Your weapon: from the enemies of Your hand</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse14">Psalm 16:14</a></span>. For My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is Your weapon, which Your hand, that is, Your <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Power, has taken to subdue thereby the kingdoms of iniquity, and divide the righteous from the ungodly. This weapon then <q>deliver from the enemies of Your hand,</q> that is, of Your Power, that is, from Mine enemies. <q>Destroy them, O Lord, from off the earth, scatter them in their life.</q> O Lord, destroy them from off the earth, which they inhabit, scatter them throughout the world in this life, which only they think their life, who  despair of life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. <q>And by Your hidden things their belly has been filled.</q> Now not only this visible punishment shall overtake them, but also their memory has been filled with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which as darkness are hidden from the light of Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that they should forget God. <q>They have been filled with swine's flesh.</q> They have been filled with uncleanness, treading under foot the pearls of God's words. <q>And they have left the rest to their babes:</q> crying out, <q>This <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be upon us and upon our children.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180520"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;27:25</a></span> </p>

<p>14. <q>But I shall appear in Your righteousness in Your sight</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa016.htm#verse15">Psalm 16:15</a></span>. But I, Who have not appeared to them that, with their filthy and darkened heart, cannot see the light of wisdom, <q>I shall appear in Your righteousness in Your sight.</q></p>

<p><q>I shall be satiated, when Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be manifested.</q> And when they have been satiated with their uncleanness, that they could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me, I shall be satiated, when Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be manifested, in them that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Me. In that verse indeed where it is said, <q>filled with swine's flesh,</q> some copies have, <q>filled with children:</q> for from the ambiguity of the Greek  a double interpretation has resulted. Now by <q>children</q> we understand works; and as by good children, good works, so by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>
