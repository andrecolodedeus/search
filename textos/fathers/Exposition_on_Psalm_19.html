<h1>Exposition on Psalm 19</h1>


<p>To the end, a psalm of David himself.</p>

<p>1. It is a well-known title; nor does the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> say what follows, but it is said of Him.</p>

<p>2. <q>The heavens tell out the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse1">Psalm 18:1</a></span>. The righteous Evangelists, in whom, as in the heavens, God dwells, set forth the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> wherewith the Son <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the Father upon earth. <q>And the firmament shows forth the works of His hands.</q> And the firmament shows forth the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the Lord's power, that now made heaven by the assurance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which before was earth by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>3. <q>Day unto day utters word</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse2">Psalm 18:2</a></span>. To the spiritual the Spirit gives out the fullness of the unchangeable Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Word which in the beginning is God with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note180551"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> <q>And night unto night announces <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> And to the fleshly, as to those afar off, the mortality of the flesh, by conveying <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, announces future <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>4. <q>There is no speech nor language, in which their voices are not heard</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse3">Psalm 18:3</a></span>. In which the voices of the Evangelists have not been heard, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was preached in every tongue.</p>

<p>5. <q>Their sound is gone out into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse4">Psalm 18:4</a></span>.</p>

<p>6. <q>In the sun has He set His tabernacle.</q> Now that He might <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the powers of temporal <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the Lord, being about to send not peace but a sword on earth, <span class="stiki" id="note180553"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> in time, or in manifestation, set so to say His military dwelling, that is, the dispensation of His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>. <q>And He as a bridegroom coming forth out of His chamber</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse5">Psalm 18:5</a></span>. And He, coming forth out of the Virgin's womb, where God was united to man's nature as a bridegroom to a bride. <q>Rejoiced as a giant to run His way.</q> Rejoiced as One exceeding strong, and surpassing all other men in power incomparable, not to inhabit, but to run His way. For, <q>He stood not in the way of sinners.</q> </p>

<p>7. <q>His going forth is from the highest heaven</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse6">Psalm 18:6</a></span>. From the Father is His going forth, not that in time, but from everlasting, whereby He was born of the Father. <q>And His meeting is even to the height of heaven.</q> And in the fullness of the Godhead He meets even to an equality with the Father.  <q>And there is none that may hide himself from His heat.</q> But whereas, <q>the Word was even made flesh, and dwelt in us,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180556"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> assuming our mortality, He permitted no man to excuse himself from the shadow of death; for the heat of the Word penetrated even it.</p>

<p>8. <q>The law of the Lord is undefiled, converting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse7">Psalm 18:7</a></span>. The law of the Lord, therefore, is Himself who came to fulfil the law, not to destroy it; <span class="stiki" id="note180557"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> an undefiled law, <q>Who did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was guile found in His mouth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180558"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:22</a></span> not oppressing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with the yoke of bondage, but converting them to imitate Him in liberty. <q>The testimony of the Lord is sure, giving wisdom to babes.</q> <q>The testimony of the Lord is sure;</q> for, <q>no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180559"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> which things have been hidden from the wise and revealed to babes; <span class="stiki" id="note180560"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;10:21</a></span> for, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180561"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James&nbsp;4:6</a></span> </p>

<p>9. <q>The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse8">Psalm 18:8</a></span>. All the statutes of the Lord are right in Him who taught not what He did not; that they who should imitate Him might <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in heart, in those things which they should do freely with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, not slavishly with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. <q>The commandment of the Lord is lucid, enlightening the eyes.</q> <q>The commandment of the Lord is lucid,</q> with no veil of carnal observances, enlightening the sight of the inner man.</p>

<p>10. <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is chaste, enduring for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse9">Psalm 18:9</a></span>. <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord;</q> not that distressing  <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> under the law, dreading exceedingly the withdrawal of temporal goods, by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> commits fornication; but that chaste <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> wherewith the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the more ardently she loves her Spouse, the more carefully does she take heed of offending Him, and therefore, <q>perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts</q> not <q>out</q> this <q><a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180563"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> but it endures for ever.</p>

<p>11. <q>The judgments of the Lord are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, justified together.</q> The judgments of Him, who <q>judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180564"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;5:22</a></span> are justified in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> unchangeably. For neither in His threatenings nor His promises does God deceive any man, nor can any withdraw either from the ungodly His punishment, or from the godly His reward. <q>To be desired more than gold, and much precious stone</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse10">Psalm 18:10</a></span>. Whether it be <q>gold and stone itself much,</q> or <q>much precious,</q> or <q>much to be desired;</q> still, the judgments of God are to be desired more than the pomp of this world; by desire of which it is brought to pass that the judgments of God are not desired, but feared, or despised, or not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. But if any be himself gold and precious stone, that he may not be consumed by fire, but received into the treasury of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, more than himself does he desire the judgments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose will he preferrs to his own. <q>And sweeter than honey and the honey comb.</q> And whether one be even now honey, who, disenthralled already from the chains of this life, is awaiting the day when he may come up to God's feast; or whether he be yet as the honey comb, wrapped about with this life as it were with wax, not mixed and become one with it, but filling it, needing some pressure of God's hand, not oppressing but expressing it, whereby from life temporal it may be strained out into life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>: to such an one the judgments of God are sweeter than he himself is to himself, for that they are <q>sweeter than honey and the honey comb.</q></p>

<p>12. <q>For Your servant keeps them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse11">Psalm 18:11</a></span>. For to him who keeps them not the day of the Lord is bitter. <q>In keeping them there is great reward.</q> Not in any external benefit, but in the thing itself, that God's judgments are kept, is there great reward; great because one rejoices therein.</p>

<p>13. <q>Who understands <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse12">Psalm 18:12.</a></span> But what sort of sweetness can there be in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, where there is no understanding? For who can understand <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which close the very eye, to which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is pleasant, to which the judgments of God are desirable and sweet? Yea, as darkness closes the eye, so do <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and suffer it not to see either the light, or itself.</p>

<p>14. <q>Cleanse me, O Lord, from my secret faults.</q> From the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> which lie hidden in me, cleanse me, O Lord. <q>And from the</q> faults <q>of others preserve Your servant</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse13">Psalm 18:13</a></span>. Let me not be led astray by others. For he is not a prey to the faults of others, who is cleansed from his own. Preserve therefore from the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of others, not the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> man, and him who would be his own master, but, Your servant. <q>If they get not the dominion over me, then shall I be undefiled.</q> If neither my own secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor those of others, get the dominion over me, then shall I be undefiled. For there is no third source of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but one's own secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> fell, and another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by which man is seduced, so as by consenting to make it his own. <q>And I shall be cleansed from the great offense.</q> What but <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>? For there is none greater than <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is <q>the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180565"><a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse12">Sirach&nbsp;10:12</a></span> And he shall indeed be undefiled, who is free from this offense also; for this is the last to them who are returning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was the first as they departed from Him.</p>

<p>15. <q>And the words of my mouth shall be pleasing, and the meditation of my heart is always in Your sight</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse14">Psalm 18:14</a></span>. The meditation of my heart is not after the vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of pleasing men, for now there is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> no more, but in Your sight always, who regardest a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. <q>O Lord, my Helper, and my Redeemer</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse15">Psalm 18:15</a></span>. O Lord, my Helper, in my approach to You; for You are my Redeemer, that I might set out unto You: lest any attributing to his own wisdom his conversion to You, or to his own strength his attaining to You, should be rather driven back by You, who resistest the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>; for he is not cleansed from the great offense, nor pleasing in Your sight, who redeemest us that we may be converted, and helpest us that we may attain unto You.</p>
