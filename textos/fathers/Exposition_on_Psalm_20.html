<h1>Exposition on Psalm 20</h1>


<p>To the end, a psalm of David.</p>

<p>1. This is a well-known title; and it is not Christ who speaks; but the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speaks to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, under the form of wishing, foretelling things to come. </p>

<p>2. <q>The Lord hear You in the day of trouble</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse1">Psalm 19:1</a></span>. The Lord hear You in the day in which Thou said, <q>Father glorify Your Son.</q>  <q>The name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob protect You.</q> For to You belongs the younger people. Since <q>the elder shall serve the younger.</q> </p>

<p>3. <q>Send You help from the Holy, and from Sion defend You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse2">Psalm 19:2</a></span>. Making for You a sanctified Body, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, from watching  safe, which waits when You shall come from the wedding.</p>

<p>4. <q>Be mindful of all Your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse3">Psalm 19:3</a></span>. Make us mindful of all Your injuries and despiteful treatment, which You have borne for us. <q>And be Your whole burnt offering made fat.</q> And turn the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, whereon You were wholly offered up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the resurrection.</p>

<p>5. <q> <em>Diapsalma.</em></q> The Lord render to You according to Your Heart <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse4">Psalm 19:4</a></span>. The Lord render to You, not according to their heart, who thought by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> they could destroy You; but according to Your Heart, wherein Thou <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> what profit Your passion would have. <span class="stiki" id="note180572"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;12:32</a></span> <q>And fulfil all Your counsel.</q> <q>And fulfil all Your counsel.</q> not only that whereby Thou laid down Your life for Your friends, <span class="stiki" id="note180573"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;15:13</a></span> that the corrupted grain might rise again to more abundance; <span class="stiki" id="note180574"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;12:24</a></span> but that also whereby <q>blindness in part has happened unto <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might enter in, and so all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> might be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180575"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;11:25-26</a></span> </p>

<p>6. <q>We will exult in Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse5">Psalm 19:5</a></span>. We will exult in that death will in no wise hurt You; for so You will also show that it cannot hurt us either. <q>And in the name of the Lord our God will we be magnified.</q> And the confession of Your name shall not only not destroy us, but shall even magnify us.</p>

<p>7. <q>The Lord fulfil all Your petitions.</q> The Lord fulfil not only the petitions which You made on earth, but those also whereby Thou intercedest for us in heaven. <q>Now have I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the Lord has saved his Christ</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse6">Psalm 19:6</a></span>. Now has it been shown to me in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, that the Lord will raise up His Christ again. <q>He will hear Him from His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> heaven.</q> He will hear Him not from earth only, where He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note180576"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;17:1</a></span> but from heaven also, where interceding for us at the Right Hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note180577"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse25">Hebrews&nbsp;7:25</a></span> He has from thence shed abroad the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> on them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. <q>In strength is the safety of His right hand.</q> Our strength is in the safety of His favour, when even out of tribulation He gives help, that <q>when we are weak, then we may be strong.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180578"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:10</a></span> <q>For vain is</q> that <q>safety of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q>  which comes not of His right hand but of His left: for thereby are they lifted up to great <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, whosoever in their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have secured a temporal safety.</p>

<p>8. <q>Some in chariots, and some in horses</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse7">Psalm 19:7</a></span>. Some are drawn away by the ever moving succession of temporal goods; and some are preferred to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> honours, and in them exult: <q>But we will exult in the name of the Lord our God.</q> But we, fixing our hope on things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and not seeking our own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, will exult in the name of the Lord our God.</p>

<p>9. <q>They have been bound, and fallen</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse8">Psalm 19:8</a></span>. And therefore were they bound by the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of temporal things, fearing to spare the Lord, lest they should lose their place by <q>the Romans:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180580"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;11:48</a></span> and rushing violently on the stone of offense and rock of stumbling, they fell from the heavenly hope: to whom the blindness in part of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has happened, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's righteousness, and wishing to establish their own.  <q>But we are risen, and stand upright.</q> But we, that the Gentile people might enter in, out of the stones raised up as children to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note180582"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;3:9</a></span> who followed not after righteousness, have attained to it, and are risen; <span class="stiki" id="note180583"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse30">Romans&nbsp;9:30</a></span> and not by our own strength, but being justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, we stand upright.</p>

<p>10. <q>O Lord, save the King:</q> that He, who in His Passion has shown us an example of conflict, should also offer up our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, the Priest raised from the dead, and established in heaven. <q>And hear us in the day when we shall call on You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa019.htm#verse9">Psalm 19:9</a></span>. And as He now offers for us, <q>hear us in the day when we shall call on You.</q></p>
