<h1>Exposition on Psalm 21</h1>


<p>To the end, a psalm of David himself.</p>

<p>1. The title is a familiar one; the Psalm is of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. </p>

<p>2. <q>O Lord, the King shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in Your strength</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse1">Psalm 20:1</a></span>. O Lord, in Your strength, whereby the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, the Man Christ Jesus shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. <q>And shall exult exceedingly in Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> And in that, whereby Thou quickenest all things, shall exult exceedingly.</p>

<p>3. <q>You have given Him the desire of His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse2">Psalm 20:2</a></span>. He desired to eat the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note180586"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;22:15</a></span> and to lay down His life when He would, and again when He would to take it; and You have given it to Him. <span class="stiki" id="note180587"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;10:18</a></span> <q>And hast not deprived Him of the good pleasure of His lips.</q> <q>My peace,</q> says He, <q>I leave with you:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180588"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;14:27</a></span> and it was done.</p>

<p>4. <q>For You have presented Him with the blessings of sweetness</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse3">Psalm 20:3</a></span>. Because He had first quaffed the blessing of Your sweetness, the gall of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> did not hurt Him. <q> <em>Diapsalma</em>. You have set a crown of precious stone on His Head.</q>  At the beginning of His discoursing precious stones were brought, and compassed Him about;  His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, from whom the commencement of His preaching should be made.</p>

<p>5. <q>He asked life; and You gave Him:</q> He asked a resurrection, saying, <q>Father, glorify Your Son;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180591"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;17:1</a></span> and You gave it Him, <q>Length of days for ever and ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse4">Psalm 20:4</a></span>. The prolonged ages of this world which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was to have, and after them an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, world without end.</p>

<p>6. <q>His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is great in Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse5">Psalm 20:5</a></span>. Great indeed is His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, whereby You have raised Him up again. <q>Glory and great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> shall Thou lay upon Him.</q> But You shall yet add unto Him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, when You shall place Him in heaven at Your right hand.</p>

<p>7. <q>For You shall give Him blessing for ever and ever.</q> This is the blessing which You shall give Him for ever and ever: <q>You shall make Him glad in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> together with Your countenance</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse6">Psalm 20:6</a></span>. According to His manhood, You shall make Him glad together with Your countenance, which He lifted up to You.</p>

<p>8. <q>For the King hopes in the Lord.</q> For the King is not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in heart, he hopes in the Lord. <q>And in the mercy of the Most Highest He shall not be moved</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse7">Psalm 20:7</a></span>. And in the mercy of the Most Highest His <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> even unto the death of the Cross shall not disturb His humility.</p>

<p>9. <q>Let Your hand be found by all Your enemies.</q> Be Your power, O King, when You come to judgment, found by all Your enemies; who in Your humiliation discerned it not. <q>Let Your right hand find out all that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse8">Psalm 20:8</a></span>. Let the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, wherein Thou reign at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, find out for punishment in the day of judgment all that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> You; for that now they have not found it.</p>

<p>10. <q>You shall make them like a fiery oven:</q> You shall make them on fire within, by the consciousness of their ungodliness: <q>In the time of Your countenance:</q> in the time of Your manifestation. <q>The Lord shall trouble them in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and the fire shall devour them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse9">Psalm 20:9</a></span>. And then, being troubled by the vengeance of the Lord, after the accusation of their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, they shall be given up to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, to be devoured.</p>

<p>11. <q>Their fruit shall You destroy out of the earth.</q> Their fruit, because it is earthly, shall You destroy out of the earth. <q>And their seed from the sons of men</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse10">Psalm 20:10</a></span>. And their works; or, whomsoever they have seduced, You shall not reckon among the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whom You have called into the everlasting inheritance.</p>

<p>12. <q>Because they turned <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> against You.</q> Now this punishment shall be recompensed to them, because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which they supposed to hang over them by Your reign, they turned against You to Your death. <q>They imagined a device, which they were not able to establish</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse11">Psalm 20:11</a></span>. They imagined a device, saying, <q>It is expedient that one die for all:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180592"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse50">John&nbsp;11:50</a></span> which they were not able to establish, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what they said.</p>

<p>13. <q>For You shall set them low.</q> For You shall rank them among those from whom in degradation and contempt You will turn away. <q>In Your leavings  You shall make ready their countenance</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse12">Psalm 20:12</a></span>. And in these things that Thou leavest, that is, in the desires of an earthly kingdom, You shall make ready their shamelessness for Your passion.</p>

<p>14. <q>Be Thou exalted, O Lord, in Your strength</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa020.htm#verse13">Psalm 20:13</a></span>. Be Thou, Lord, whom in humiliation they did not discern, exalted in Your strength, which they thought weakness. <q>We will sing and praise Your power.</q> In heart and in deed we will celebrate and make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Your marvels.</p>
