<h1>Exposition on Psalm 23</h1>

<p>A psalm of David himself.</p>

<p>1. The Church speaks to Christ: <q>The Lord feeds me, and I shall lack nothing</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse1">Psalm 22:1</a></span>. The Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> is my Shepherd, <q>and I shall lack nothing.</q></p>

<p>2. <q>In a place of pasture there has He placed me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse2">Psalm 22:2</a></span>. In a place of fresh pasture, leading me to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  there has He placed me to be nourished. <q>By the water of refreshing has He brought me up.</q> By the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, whereby they are refreshed who have lost health and strength, has He brought me up.</p>

<p>3. <q>He has converted my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: He has led me forth in the paths of righteousness, for His Name's sake</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse3">Psalm 22:3</a></span>. He has brought me forth in the narrow ways, wherein few walk, of His righteousness; not for my merit's sake, but for His Name's sake.</p>

<p>4. <q>Yea, though I walk in the midst of the shadow of death</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse4">Psalm 22:4</a></span>. Yea, though I walk in the midst of this life, which is the shadow of death.  <q>I will <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for You are with me.</q> I will <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, for You dwell in my heart by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and You are now with me, that after the shadow of death I too may be with You. <q>Your rod and Your staff, they have comforted me.</q> Your discipline, like a rod for a flock of sheep, and like a staff for children of some size, and growing out of the natural into spiritual life, they have not been grievous to me; rather have they comforted me: because You are mindful of me.</p>

<p>5. <q>You have prepared a table in my sight, against them that trouble me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse5">Psalm 22:5</a></span>. Now after the rod, whereby, while a little one, and living the natural life, I was brought up among the flock in the pastures; after that rod, I say, when I began to be under the staff, You have prepared a table in my sight, that I should no more be fed as a babe with milk, <span class="stiki" id="note180618"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> but being older should take meat, strengthened against them that trouble me. <q>You have fattened my head with oil.</q> You have gladdened my mind with spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. <q>And Your inebriating cup, how excellent is it!</q> And Your cup yielding forgetfulness of former vain delights, how excellent is it!</p>

<p>6. <q>And Your mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:</q> that is, as long as I live in this mortal life, not Yours, but mine. <q>That I may dwell in the house of the Lord  for length of days</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse6">Psalm 22:6</a></span>. Now Your mercy shall follow me not here only, but also that I may dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.</p>
