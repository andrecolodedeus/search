<h1>Exposition on Psalm 24</h1>


<p> <em>A psalm of David himself, on the first day of the week.</em> </p>

<p>1. A Psalm of David himself, touching the glorifying and resurrection of the Lord, which took place early in the morning on the first day of the week, which is now called the <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a>.</p>

<p>2. <q>The earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof, the compass of the world, and all they that dwell therein</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse1">Psalm 23:1</a></span>; when the Lord, being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, is announced for the believing of all nations; and the whole compass of the world becomes His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <q>He has founded it above the seas.</q> He has most firmly established it above all the waves of this world, that they should be subdued by it, and should not hurt it. <q>And has prepared it above the rivers</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse2">Psalm 23:2</a></span>. The rivers flow into the sea, and men of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> lapse into the world: these also the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which, when worldly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> have been conquered by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has been prepared by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the reception of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, subdues.</p>

<p>3. <q>Who shall ascend into the mount of the Lord?</q> Who shall ascend to the height of the righteousness of the Lord? <q>Or who shall stand in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse3">Psalm 23:3</a></span>. Or who shall abide in that place, whither He shall ascend,  founded above the seas, and prepared above the rivers?</p>

<p>4. <q>The innocent of hand, and the pure in heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse4">Psalm 23:4</a></span>. Who then shall ascend there, and abide there, but the guiltless in deed, and pure in thought? <q>Who has not received his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in vain.</q> Who has not reckoned his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> among things that pass away, but feeling it to be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, has longed for an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> steadfast and unchangeable. <q>And has not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> in deceit to his neighbour.</q> And therefore without deceit, as things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> are simple and undeceiving, has so behaved himself to his neighbour.</p>

<p>5. <q>This man shall receive blessing from the Lord, and mercy from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a></q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse5">Psalm 23:5</a></span>.</p>

<p>6. <q>This is the generation of them that seek the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse6">Psalm 23:6</a></span>. For thus are they born that seek Him. <q>Of them that seek the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob.  <em> Diapsalma.</em></q> Now they seek the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gave the pre-eminence to the younger born. <span class="stiki" id="note180625"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;9:12</a></span> </p>

<p>7. <q>Take away your gates, you princes</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse7">Psalm 23:7</a></span>. All you, that seek rule among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, remove, that they hinder not, the entrances which you have made, of desire and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. <q>And be lifted up, you everlasting gates.</q> And be lifted up, you entrances of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, of renunciation of the world, and conversion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>And the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall come in.</q> And the King, in whom we may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> without <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, shall come in: who having overcome the gates of death, and having opened for Himself the heavenly places, fulfilled that which He said, <q>Be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180626"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;16:33</a></span> </p>

<p>8. <q>Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> Mortal nature is awe-struck in wonder, and asks, <q>Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> <q>The Lord strong and mighty.</q> He whom you deemed weak and overwhelmed. <q>The Lord mighty in battle</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse8">Psalm 23:8</a></span>. Handle the scars, and you will find them made whole, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness restored to <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. The glorifying of the Lord, which was owing to earth, where It warred with death, has been paid.</p>

<p>9. <q>Take away your gates, you princes.</q>  Let us go hence straightway into heaven. Again, let the Prophet's trumpet cry aloud, <q>Take away too, you princes of the air, the gates, which you have in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who 'worship the <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180628"><a href="../bible/2ki017.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;17:16</a></span> <q>And be lifted up, you everlasting gates.</q> And be lifted up, you doors of everlasting righteousness, of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, through which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> loves the One True <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and goes not a-whoring with the many that are called gods. <q>And the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall come in</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse9">Psalm 23:9</a></span>. <q>And the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall come in,</q> that He may at the right hand of the Father intercede for us.</p>

<p>10. <q>Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> What! Do you too, prince of the power of this air, <span class="stiki" id="note180629"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> marvel and ask, <q>Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> <q>The Lord of powers, He is the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa023.htm#verse10">Psalm 23:10</a></span>. Yea, His Body now quickened, He who was tempted marches above you; He who was tempted by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, the deceiver, goes above all <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Let none of you put himself before us and stop our way, that he may be worshipped as a god by us: neither principality, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, nor power, separates us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note180630"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse39">Romans&nbsp;8:39</a></span> It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to trust in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, rather than to trust in a prince;  that he who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note180632"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:31</a></span> These indeed are powers in the administration of this world, but <q>the Lord of powers, He is the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q></p>
