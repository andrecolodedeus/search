<h1>Exposition on Psalm 26</h1>


<p>Of David himself.</p>

<p>1. It may be attributed to David himself, not the Mediator, the Man Christ Jesus, but the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> now perfectly established in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>2. <q>Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse1">Psalm 25:1</a></span>. Judge me, O Lord, for, after the mercy which You first showed  me, I have some desert of my innocence, the way whereof I have kept. <q>And trusting in the Lord I shall not be moved.</q> And yet not even so trusting in myself, but in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, I shall abide in Him.</p>

<p>3. <q>Prove me, O Lord, and try me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse2">Psalm 25:2</a></span>. Lest, however, any of my secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be hid from me, prove me, O Lord, and try me, making me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, not to You from whom nothing is hid, but to myself, and to men. <q>Burn my reins and my heart.</q> Apply a remedial purgation, as it were fire, to my pleasures and thoughts. <q>For Your mercy is before my eyes</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse3">Psalm 25:3</a></span>. For, that I be not consumed by that fire, not my merits, but Your mercy, whereby You have brought me on to such a life, is before my eyes. <q>And I have been pleasing in Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> And since my own <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> has been displeasing to me, but Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> pleasing, I have myself been pleasing also with it and in it.</p>

<p>4. <q>I have not sat with the council of vanity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse4">Psalm 25:4</a></span>. I have not chosen to give my heart to them who endeavour to provide, what is impossible, how they may be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the enjoyment of things transitory. <q>And I will not enter in with them that work wickedly.</q> And since this is the very <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, therefore I will not have my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> hid, with them that work wickedly.</p>

<p>5. <q>I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the congregation of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doers.</q> But to arrive at this council of vanity, congregations of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doers are formed, which I have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>. <q>And I will not sit with the ungodly</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse5">Psalm 25:5</a></span>. And, therefore, with such a council, with the ungodly, I will not sit, that is, I will not place my consent.  <q>And I will not sit with the ungodly.</q></p>

<p>6. <q>I will wash mine hands amid the innocent</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse6">Psalm 25:6</a></span>. I will make clean my works among the innocent: among the innocent will I wash mine hands, with which I shall embrace Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> gifts.  <q>And I will compass Your altar, O Lord.</q> </p>

<p>7. <q>That I may hear the voice of Your praise.</q> That I may learn how to praise You. <q>And that I may declare all Your wondrous works</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse7">Psalm 25:7</a></span>. And after I have learned, I may set forth all Your wondrous works.</p>

<p>8. <q>O Lord, I have loved the beauty of Your house:</q> of Your Church. <q>And the place of the habitation of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse8">Psalm 25:8</a></span>: where You dwell, and art <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</p>

<p>9. <q>Destroy not my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the ungodly</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse9">Psalm 25:9</a></span>. Destroy not then, together with them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> You, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which has loved the beauty of Your house. <q>And my life with the men of blood.</q> And with them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> their neighbour. For Your house is beautified with the two commandments. </p>

<p>10. <q>In whose hands is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> Destroy me not then with the ungodly and the men of blood, whose works are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. <q>Their right hand is full of gifts</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse10">Psalm 25:10</a></span>. And that which was given them to obtain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, they have converted into the receiving this world's gifts, <q>supposing that godliness is a trade.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180648"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:5</a></span> </p>

<p>11. <q>But I have walked in mine innocence: deliver me, and have mercy on me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse11">Psalm 25:11</a></span>. Let so great a price of my Lord's Blood avail for my complete deliverance: and in the dangers of this life let not Your mercy leave me.</p>

<p>12. <q>My foot has stood in uprightness.</q> My Love has not withdrawn from Your righteousness. <q>In the Churches I will bless You, O Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa025.htm#verse12">Psalm 25:12</a></span>. I will not hide Your blessing, O Lord, from those whom You have called; for next to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of You I join the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of my neighbour.</p>
