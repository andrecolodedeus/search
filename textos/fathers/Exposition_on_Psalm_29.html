<h1>Exposition on Psalm 29</h1>


<p>A psalm of David himself, of the consummation of the tabernacle.</p>

<p>1. A Psalm of the Mediator Himself, strong of hand, of the perfection of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this world, where she <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> in time against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>2. The Prophet speaks, <q>Bring unto the Lord, O you Sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, bring unto the Lord the young of rams</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse1">Psalm 28:1</a></span>. Bring unto the Lord yourselves, whom the Apostles, the leaders of the flocks, have begotten by the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note180664"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:15</a></span> <q>Bring unto the Lord <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse2">Psalm 28:2</a></span>. By your works let the Lord be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> and honoured. <q>Bring unto the Lord <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to His name.</q> Let Him be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> throughout the world. <q>Worship the Lord in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> court.</q> Worship the Lord in your heart enlarged and sanctified. For you are His regal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> habitation.</p>

<p>3. <q>The Voice of the Lord is upon the waters</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse3">Psalm 28:3</a></span>. The Voice of Christ is upon the peoples. <q>The God of majesty has thundered.</q> The God of majesty, from the cloud of the flesh, has awfully preached repentance. <q>The Lord is upon many waters.</q> The Lord Jesus Himself, after that He sent forth His Voice upon the peoples, and struck them with awe, converted them to Himself, and dwelt in them.</p>

<p>4. <q>The Voice of the Lord is in power</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse4">Psalm 28:4</a></span>. The Voice of the Lord now in them themselves, making them powerful. <q>The Voice of the Lord is in great might.</q> The Voice of the Lord working great things in them.</p>

<p>5. <q>The Voice of the Lord breaking the cedars</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse5">Psalm 28:5</a></span>. The Voice of the Lord humbling the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> in brokenness of heart. <q>The Lord shall break the cedars of Libanus.</q> The Lord by repentance shall break them that are lifted on high by the splendour of earthly nobility, when to confound them He shall have <q>chosen the base things of this world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180665"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:28</a></span> in the which to display His Divinity.</p>

<p>6. <q>And shall bruise them as the calf of Libanus</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse6">Psalm 28:6</a></span>. And when their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> exaltation has been cut off, He will lay them low after the imitation of His Own humility, who like a calf was led to slaughter <span class="stiki" id="note180666"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> by the nobility of this world. <q>For the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers agreed together against the Lord, and against His Christ.</q>  <q>And the Beloved is as the young of the unicorns.</q> For even He the Beloved, and the Only One of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>emptied Himself</q> of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and was made man, <span class="stiki" id="note180668"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> like a child of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that were <q><a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's righteousness,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180669"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3</a></span> and proudly boasting of their own righteousness as peculiarly theirs.</p>

<p>7. <q>The Voice of the Lord cutting short the flame of fire</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse7">Psalm 28:7</a></span>. The Voice of the Lord, without any harm to Himself, passing through all the excited ardour of them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Him, or dividing the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> rage of His persecutors, so that some should say, <q>Is not this haply the very Christ;</q> others, <q>Nay; but He deceives the people:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180670"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse41">John&nbsp;7:41,&nbsp;12</a></span> and so cutting short their mad tumult, as to pass some over into His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and leave others in their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.</p>

<p>8. <q>The Voice of the Lord moving the wilderness</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse8">Psalm 28:8</a></span>. The Voice of the Lord moving to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> once <q>without hope, and without God in the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180671"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;2:12</a></span> where no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, no preacher of God's word, as it were, no man had dwelt. <q>And the Lord will move the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of Cades.</q> And then the Lord will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> word of His Scriptures to be fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, which was abandoned by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who understood it not.</p>

<p>9. <q>The Voice of the Lord perfecting the stags</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse9">Psalm 28:9</a></span>. For the Voice of the Lord has first perfected them that overcame and repelled the envenomed tongues.  <q>And will reveal the woods.</q> And then will He reveal to them the darknesses of the Divine books, and the shadowy depths of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, where they feed with freedom. <q>And in His temple does every man speak of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> And in His Church all born again to an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> hope praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, each for His own gift, which He has received from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>10. <q>The Lord inhabites the deluge</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse10">Psalm 28:10</a></span>. The Lord therefore first inhabites the deluge of this world in His Saints, kept safely in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as in the ark. <q>And the Lord shall sit a King for ever.</q> And afterward He will sit reigning in them for ever.</p>

<p>11. <q>The Lord will give strength to His people</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa028.htm#verse11">Psalm 28:11</a></span>. For the Lord will give strength to His people fighting against the storms and whirlwinds of this world, for peace in this world He has not promised them. <span class="stiki" id="note180675"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;16:33</a></span> <q>The Lord will bless His people in peace.</q> And the same Lord will bless His people, affording them peace in Himself; for, says He, <q>My peace I give unto you, My peace I leave with you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180676"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;14:27</a></span> </p>
