<h1>Exposition on Psalm 3</h1>


<p>A psalm of David, when he fled from the face of Abessalon his son.</p>

<p>1. The words, <q>I slept, and took rest; and rose, for the Lord will take me up,</q> lead us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that this Psalm is to be understood as in the Person of Christ; for they sound more applicable to the Passion and Resurrection of our Lord, than to that history in which David's flight is described from the face of his rebellious son. And, since it is written of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>The sons of the bridegroom fast not as long as the bridegroom is with them;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180036"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;9:15</a></span> it is no wonder if by his undutiful  son be here meant that undutiful  <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> who betrayed Him. From whose face although it may be understood historically that He fled, when on his departure He withdrew with the rest to the mountain; yet in a spiritual sense, when the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, that is the Power and Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, abandoned the mind of Judas; when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> wholly occupied him; as it is written, <q>The Devil entered into his heart,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180039"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;13:27</a></span> may it be well understood that Christ fled from his face; not that Christ gave place to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>, but that on Christ's departure the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> took possession. Which departure, I suppose, is called a flight in this Psalm, because of its quickness; which is indicated also by the word of our Lord, saying, <q>That you do, do quickly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180040"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;13:27</a></span> So even in common conversation we say of anything that does not come to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it has fled from me; and of a man of much learning we say, nothing flies from him. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> fled from the mind of Judas, when it ceased to enlighten him. But Absalom, as some interpret, in the Latin tongue signifies, <em>Patris pax</em>, a father's peace. And it may seem strange, whether in the history of the kings, when Absalom carried on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against his father; or in the history of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, when Judas was the betrayer of our Lord; how <q>father's peace</q> can be understood. But both in the former place they who read carefully, see that David in that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was at peace with his son, who even with sore grief lamented his death, saying, <q>O Absalom, my son, would God I had died for you!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180041"><a href="../bible/2sa018.htm#verse33">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;18:33</a></span> And in the history of the  <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> by that so great and so wonderful forbearance of our Lord; in that He bore so long with him as if good, when He was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his thoughts; in that He admitted him to the Supper in which He committed and delivered to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> the figure of His Body and Blood; finally, in that He received the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of peace at the very time of His betrayal; it is easily understood how Christ showed peace to His betrayer, although he was laid waste by the intestine <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of so abominable a device. And therefore is Absalom called <q>father's peace,</q> because his father had the peace, which he had not.</p>

<p>2. <q>O Lord, how are they multiplied that trouble me!</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa003.htm#verse1">Psalm 3:1</a></span>. So multiplied indeed were they, that one even from the number of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> was not wanting, who was added to the number of His persecutors. <q>Many rise up against me; many say unto my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, There is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for him in his God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa003.htm#verse2">Psalm 3:2</a></span>. It is clear that if they had had any idea that He would rise again, assuredly they would not have slain Him. To this end are those speeches, <q>Let Him come down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, if He be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q> and again, <q>He saved others, Himself He cannot save.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180042"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;27:42</a></span> Therefore, neither would Judas have betrayed Him, if he had not been of the number of those who despised Christ, saying, <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for Him in His God.</q></p>

<p>3. <q>But You, O Lord, art my taker.</q>  It is said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for the taking of man is, the Word made Flesh. <q>My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> Even He calls God his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> so took, that God became one with Him. Let the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> learn, who unwillingly hear, when it is said to them, <q>For what have you that you did not receive? Now if you received it, why do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if you had not received it?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180044"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> <q>And the lifter up of my head</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa003.htm#verse3">Psalm 3:3</a></span>. I think that this should be here taken of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is not unreasonably called the head of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;  which so inhered in, and in a sort coalesced with, the supereminent excellency of the Word taking man, that it was not laid aside by so great humiliation of the Passion.</p>

<p>4. <q>With my voice have I cried unto the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa003.htm#verse4">Psalm 3:4</a></span>; that is, not with the voice of the body, which is drawn out with the sound of the reverberation of the air; but with the voice of the heart, which to men speaks not, but with God sounds as a cry. By this voice Susanna was heard;  and with this voice the Lord Himself commanded that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be made in closets, <span class="stiki" id="note180047"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;6:6</a></span> that is, in the recesses of the heart noiselessly. Nor would one easily say that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not made with this voice, if no sound of words is uttered from the body; since even when in silence we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> within the heart, if thoughts interpose alien from the mind of one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, it cannot yet be said, <q>With my voice have I cried unto the Lord.</q> Nor is this rightly said, save when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, taking to itself nothing of the flesh, and nothing of the aims of the flesh, in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, speaks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where He only hears. But even this is called a cry by reason of the strength of its intention. <q>And He heard me out of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain.</q> We have the Lord Himself called a mountain by the Prophet, as it is written, <q>The stone that was cut out without hands grew to the size of a mountain.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180048"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse34">Daniel&nbsp;2:34-35</a></span> But this cannot be taken of His Person, unless perhaps He would speak thus, out of myself, as of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain He heard me, when He dwelt in me, that is, in this very mountain. But it is more plain and unembarrassed, if we understand that God out of His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> heard. For it was just that He should raise again from the dead the Innocent who was slain, and to whom <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had been recompensed for good, and that He should render to the persecutor a meet reward, who repaid Him <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for good. For we read, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is as the mountains of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>5. <q>I slept, and took rest</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa003.htm#verse5">Psalm 3:5</a></span>. It may be not unsuitably remarked, that it is expressly said, <q>I,</q> to signify that of His own Will He underwent death, according to that, <q>Therefore does My Father <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me, because I lay down My life, that I might take it again. No man takes it from Me; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180051"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;10:17-18</a></span> Therefore, says He, you have not taken Me as though against My will, and slain Me; but <q>I slept, and took rest; and rose, for the Lord will take me up.</q> Scripture contains numberless instances of sleep being put for death; as the Apostle says, <q>I would not have you to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, brethren, concerning them which are asleep.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180052"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> Nor need we make any question why it is added, <q>took rest,</q> seeing that it has already been said, <q>I slept.</q> Repetitions of this kind are usual in Scripture, as we have pointed out many in the second Psalm. But some copies have, <q>I slept, and was cast into a deep sleep.</q>  And different copies express it differently, according to the possible renderings of the Greek words, <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x1F7C; &#x03B4;<!--k29--&#x0161; &#x1F10;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x1F75;&#x03B8;&#x03B7;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x1F55;&#x03C0;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;</span>. Unless perhaps sleeping  may be taken of one dying, but  sleep  of one dead: so that sleeping may be the transition into sleep, as awakening is the transition into wakefulness. Let us not deem these repetitions in the sacred writings empty ornaments of speech. <q>I slept, and took rest,</q> is therefore well understood as <q>I gave Myself up to My Passion, and death ensued.</q> <q>And I rose, for the Lord will take Me up.</q>  This is the more to be remarked, how that in one sentence the Psalmist has used a verb of past and future time. For he has said, both <q>I rose,</q> which is the past, and <q>will take Me up,</q> which is the future; seeing that assuredly the rising again could not be without that taking up. But in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> the future is well joined to the past, whereby both are signified. Since things which are prophesied of as yet to come in reference to time are future; but in reference to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those who prophesy they are already to be viewed as done. Verbs of the present tense are also mixed in, which shall be treated of in their proper place when they occur.</p>

<p>6. <q>I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the thousands of people that surround me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa003.htm#verse6">Psalm 3:6</a></span>. It is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> how great a multitude stood around Him as He was suffering, and on the cross. <q>Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa003.htm#verse7">Psalm 3:7</a></span>. It is not said to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>Arise,</q> as if asleep or lying down, but it is usual in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture to attribute to God what He does in us; not indeed universally, but where it can be done suitably; as when He is said to speak, when by His gift Prophets speak, and Apostles, or whatsoever messengers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hence that text, <q>Would you have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who speaks in me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180057"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> For he does not say, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by whose enlightening or order I speak; but he attributes at once the speaking itself to Him, by whose gift he spoke.</p>

<p>7. <q>Since You have smitten all who oppose me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</q> It is not to be pointed as if it were one sentence, <q>Arise, O Lord, save me, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; since You have smitten all who oppose me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</q> For He did not therefore save Him, because He smote His enemies; but rather He being saved, He smote them. Therefore it belongs to what follows, so that the sense is this; <q>Since You have smitten all who oppose me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, You have broken the teeth of the sinners;</q> that is, thereby have You broken the teeth of the sinners, since You have smitten all who oppose me. It is forsooth the punishment of the opposers, whereby their teeth have been broken, that is, the words of sinners rending with their cursing the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, brought to nought, as it were to dust; so that we may understand <q>teeth</q> thus, as words of cursing. Of  which teeth the Apostle speaks, <q>If you bite one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180059"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse15">Galatians&nbsp;5:15</a></span> The teeth of sinners can also be taken as the chiefs of sinners; by whose authority each one is cut off from the fellowship of godly livers, and as it were incorporated with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> livers. To these teeth are opposed the Church's teeth, by whose authority <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are cut off from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and various opinions, and are translated into that fellowship which is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. With these teeth Peter was told to eat the animals when they had been killed, that is, by killing in the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> what they were, and changing them into what he was himself. Of these teeth too of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> it is said, <q>Your teeth are as a flock of shorn sheep, coming up from the bath, whereof every one bears twins, and there is not one barren among them.</q>  These are they who prescribe rightly, and as they prescribe, live; who do what is written, <q>Let your works shine before men, that they may bless your Father which is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180061"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span> For moved by their authority, they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God who speaks and works through these men; and separated from the world, to which they were once conformed, they pass over into the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And rightly therefore are they, through whom such things are done, called teeth like to shorn sheep; for they have laid aside the burdens of earthly cares, and coming up from the bath, from the washing away of the filth of the world by the Sacrament of Baptism, every one bears twins. For they fulfil the two commandments, of which it is said, <q>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180062"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;22:40</a></span> loving God with all their heart, and with all their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and their neighbour as themselves. <q>There is not one barren among them,</q> for much fruit they render unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. According to this sense then it is to be thus understood, <q>You have broken the teeth of the sinners,</q> that is, You have brought the chiefs of the sinners to nought, by smiting all who oppose Me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For the chiefs according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> history <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Him, while the lower people honoured Him.</p>

<p>8. <q>Salvation is of the Lord; and upon Your people be Your blessing</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa003.htm#verse8">Psalm 3:8</a></span>. In one sentence the Psalmist has enjoined men what to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and has <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. For when it is said, <q>Salvation is of the Lord,</q> the words are addressed to men. Nor does it follow, <q>And upon Your people</q> be <q>Your blessing,</q> in such wise as that the whole is spoken to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but there is a change into <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> addressed to God Himself, for the very people to whom it  was said, <q>Salvation is of the Lord.</q> What else then does he say but this? Let no man presume on himself, seeing that it is of the Lord to save from the death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for, <q>Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180063"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24-25</a></span> But bless, O Lord, Your people, who look for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from You.</p>

<p>9. This Psalm can be taken as in the Person of Christ another way; which is that whole Christ should speak.  I mean by whole, with His body, of which He is the Head, according to the Apostle, who says, <q>You are the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the members.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180065"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:27</a></span> He therefore is the Head of this body; wherefore in another place he says, <q>But doing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, we may increase in Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, from whom the whole body is joined together and compacted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180066"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse15">Ephesians&nbsp;4:15-16</a></span> In the Prophet then at once, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and her Head (the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> founded amidst the storms of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> throughout the whole world, which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> already to have come to pass), speaks, <q>O Lord, how are they multiplied that trouble me! Many rise up against me;</q> wishing to exterminate the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name. <q>Many say unto my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, There is no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for him in his God.</q> For they would not otherwise hope that they could destroy the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, branching out so very far and wide, unless they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that God had no care thereof. <q>But You, O Lord, art my taker;</q> in Christ of course.

Let the people of God also say, <q>I slept, and took rest; and rose, for the Lord will take me up;</q> that they may be joined, and cleave to their Head.  For to this people is it said, <q>Awake you that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall lay hold on you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180073"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;5:14</a></span> Since they are taken out of sinners, of whom it is said generally, <q>But they that sleep, sleep in the night.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180074"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:7</a></span> Let them say moreover, <q>I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the thousands of people that surround me;</q> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> verily that compass me about to extinguish everywhere, if they could, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name. But how should they be feared, when by the blood of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as by oil, the ardour of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is inflamed? <q>Arise, O Lord, save me, O my God.</q> The body can address this to its own Head. For at His rising the body was saved; who <q>ascended up on high, led captivity captive, gave gifts unto men.</q>  For this is said by the Prophet, in the secret purpose of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  until that ripe harvest <span class="stiki" id="note180077"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;9:37</a></span> which is spoken of in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is in His Resurrection, who vouchsafed to die for us, shed out our Lord to the earth. <q>Since You have smitten all who oppose me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, You have broken the teeth of the sinners.</q> Now while the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has rule, the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name are smitten with confusion; and, whether their curses or their chiefs, brought to nought.

<p>10.
