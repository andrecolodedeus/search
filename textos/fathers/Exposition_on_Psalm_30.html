<h1>Exposition on Psalm 30</h1>


<p> <em>To the end, the psalm of the canticle</em>  <em>of the dedication of the house, of David himself.</em></p>

<p>1. To the end, a Psalm of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the Resurrection, and the change, the renewing of the body to an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> state, and not only of the Lord, but also of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For in the former Psalm the tabernacle was finished, wherein we dwell in the time of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: but now the house is dedicated, which will abide in peace everlasting.</p>

<p>2. It is then whole Christ who speaks. <q>I will exalt You, O Lord, for You have taken Me up</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse1">Psalm 29:1</a></span>. I will praise Your high Majesty, O Lord, for You have taken Me up. <q>You have not made Mine enemies to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over Me.</q> And those, who have so often endeavoured to oppress Me with various <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> throughout the world, You have not made to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over Me.</p>

<p>3. <q>O Lord, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have cried unto You, and You have healed Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse2">Psalm 29:2</a></span>. O Lord, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have cried unto You, and I no longer bear about a body enfeebled and sick by mortality.</p>

<p>4. <q>O Lord, You have brought back My Soul from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and You have saved Me from them that go down into the pit</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse3">Psalm 29:3</a></span>. You have saved Me from the condition of profound darkness, and the lowest slough of corruptible flesh.</p>

<p>5. <q>Sing to the Lord, O you <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of His.</q> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> seeing these future things, rejoices, and says, <q>Sing to the Lord, O you <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of His. And make confession of the remembrance of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse4">Psalm 29:4</a></span>. And make confession to Him, that He has not forgotten the sanctification, wherewith He has sanctified you, although all this intermediate period belong to your desires.</p>

<p>6. <q>For in His indignation is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse5">Psalm 29:5</a></span>. For He has avenged against you the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for which you have paid by death. <q>And life in His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</q> And life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, whereunto you could not return by any strength of your own, has He given, because He so would. <q>In the evening weeping will tarry.</q> Evening began, when the light of wisdom withdrew from sinful man, when he was condemned to death: from this evening weeping will tarry, as long as God's people are, amid labours and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, awaiting the day of the Lord. <q>And exultation in the morning.</q> Even to the morning, when there will be the exultation of the resurrection, which has shone forth by anticipation in the morning resurrection of the Lord.</p>

<p>7. <q>But I said in my abundance, I shall not be moved for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse6">Psalm 29:6</a></span>. But I, that people which was speaking from the first, said in mine abundance, suffering now no more any want, <q>I shall not be moved for ever.</q></p>

<p>8. <q>O Lord, in Your will You have afforded strength unto my beauty</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse7">Psalm 29:7</a></span>. But that this my abundance, O Lord, is not of myself, but that in Your will You have afforded strength unto my beauty, I have learned from this, <q> You turned away Your Face from me, and I became troubled;</q> for You have sometimes turned away Your Face from the sinner, and I became troubled, when the illumination of Your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> withdrew from me.</p>

<p>9. <q>Unto You, O Lord, will I cry, and unto my God will I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse8">Psalm 29:8</a></span>. And bringing to mind that time of my trouble and misery, and as it were established therein, I hear the voice of Your First-Begotten, my Head, about to die for me, and saying <q>Unto You, O Lord, will I cry, and unto My God will I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.</q></p>

<p>10. <q>What profit</q> is there in the shedding of My blood, while I go down to corruption? <q>Shall dust confess unto You?</q> For if I shall not rise immediately, and My body shall become corrupt, <q>shall dust confess unto You?</q> that is, the crowd of the ungodly, whom I shall justify by My resurrection? <q>Or declare Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</q> Or for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the rest declare Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</p>

<p>11. <q>The Lord has heard, and had mercy on Me, the Lord has become My helper.</q> Nor did <q>He suffer His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> One to see corruption</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse10">Psalm 29:10</a></span>.</p>

<p>12. <q>You have turned My mourning into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse11">Psalm 29:11</a></span>. Whom I, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, having received, the First-Begotten from the dead, <span class="stiki" id="note180680"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse5">Revelation&nbsp;1:5</a></span> now in the dedication of Your house, say, <q>You have turned my mourning into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to me. You have put off my sackcloth, and girded me with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>.</q> You have torn off the veil of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the sadness of my mortality; and hast girded me with the first robe, with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>.</p>

<p>13. <q>That my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should sing unto You, and I should not be pricked</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa029.htm#verse12">Psalm 29:12</a></span>. That now, not my humiliation, but my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should not lament, but should sing unto You, for that now out of humiliation You have exalted me; and that I should not be pricked with the consciousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of judgment. <q>O Lord, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I will confess unto You for ever.</q> And this is my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, O Lord, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I should confess unto You for ever, that I have nothing of myself, but that all my good is of You, who art <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, All in all.</q> </p>
