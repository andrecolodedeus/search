<h1>Exposition on Psalm 31</h1>


<p> <em>To the end, a psalm of David himself, an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>.</em> </p>

<p>1. To the end a Psalm of David Himself, the Mediator strong of hand in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>. For the word <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>, which is added to the title, signifies a transport of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is produced either by a panic, or by some revelation. But in this Psalm the panic of the people of God troubled by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and by the failing of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> throughout the world, is principally seen. But first the Mediator Himself speaks: then the People redeemed by His Blood gives thanks: at last in trouble it speaks at length, which is what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a>; but the Person of the Prophet himself is twice interposed, near the end, and at the end.</p>

<p>2. <q>In You, O Lord, have I trusted, let Me not be put to confusion for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse1">Psalm 30:1</a></span>. In You, O Lord, have I trusted, let Me never be confounded, while they shall insult Me as one like other men. <q>In Your righteousness rescue Me, and deliver Me.</q> And in Your righteousness rescue Me from the pit of death, and deliver Me out of their company.</p>

<p>3. <q>Bend down Your ear unto Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse2">Psalm 30:2</a></span>. Hear Me in My humiliation, near at hand unto Me. <q>Make haste to deliver Me.</q> Defer not to the end of the world, as with all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me, My separation from sinners. <q>Be unto Me a God who protects Me.</q> Be unto Me <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Protector. <q>And a house of refuge, that You may save Me.</q> And as a house, wherein taking refuge I may be saved.</p>

<p>4. <q>For You are My strength, and My refuge</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse3">Psalm 30:3</a></span>. For You are unto Me My strength to bear My persecutors, and My refuge to escape them. <q>And for Your Name's sake You shall be My guide, and shall nourish Me.</q> And that by Me You may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. I will in all things follow Your will; and, by assembling, by degrees, Saints unto Me, You shall fulfil My body, and My perfect stature.</p>

<p>5. <q>You shall bring Me out of this trap, which they have hidden for Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse4">Psalm 30:4</a></span>. You shall bring Me out of these snares, which they have hidden for Me. <q>For You are My Protector.</q></p>

<p>6. <q>Into Your hands I commend My Spirit</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse5">Psalm 30:5</a></span>. To Your power I commend My Spirit, soon to receive It back. <q>You have redeemed Me, O Lord God of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Let the people too, redeemed by the Passion of their Lord, and joyful in the glorifying of their Head, say, <q>You have redeemed me, O Lord God of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<p>7. <q>Thou hatest them that hold to vanity uselessly</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse6">Psalm 30:6</a></span>. Thou hatest them that hold to the false <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the world. <q>But I have trusted in the Lord.</q></p>

<p>8. <q>I will be glad, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in Your mercy:</q> which does not deceive me. <q>For You have regarded My humiliation:</q> wherein You have subjected me to vanity in hope. <span class="stiki" id="note180684"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;8:20</a></span> <q>You have saved my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from necessities</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse7">Psalm 30:7</a></span>. You have saved my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the necessities of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, that with a free <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it may serve You.</p>

<p>9. <q>And hast not shut me up into the hands of the enemy</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse8">Psalm 30:8</a></span>. And hast not shut me up, that I should have no opening for recovering unto liberty, and be given over for ever into the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, ensnaring me with the desire of this life, and terrifying me with death. <q>You have set my feet in a large room.</q> The resurrection of my Lord being <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and my own being promised me, my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, having been brought out of the straits of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, walks abroad in continuance, into the expanse of liberty.</p>

<p>10. <q>Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am troubled</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse9">Psalm 30:9</a></span>. But what is this unlooked-for cruelty of the persecutors, striking such dread into me? <q>Have mercy on me, O Lord.</q> For I am now no more alarmed for death, but for torments and tortures. <q>My eye has been disordered by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> I had my eye upon You, that You should not abandon me: You are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and hast disordered it. <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and my belly.</q> By the same <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been disturbed, and my memory, whereby I retained what my God has suffered for me, and what He has promised me.</p>

<p>11. <q>For my life has failed in pain</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse10">Psalm 30:10</a></span>. For my life is to confess You, but it failed in pain, when the enemy had said, Let them be tortured until they deny Him. <q>And my years in groanings.</q> The time that I pass in this world is not taken away from me by death, but abides, and is spent in groanings. <q>My strength has been weakened by want.</q> I want the health of this body, and racking pains come on me: I want the dissolution of the body, and death forbears to come: and in this want my confidence has been weakened. <q>And my bones have been disturbed.</q> And my steadfastness has been disturbed.</p>

<p>12. <q>I have been made a reproach above all mine enemies</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse11">Psalm 30:11</a></span>. All the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are my enemies; and nevertheless they for their wickednesses are tortured only till they confess: I then have overpassed their reproach, I, whose confession death does not follow, but racking pains follow upon it. <q>And to my neighbours too much.</q> This has seemed too much to them, who were already drawing near to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, and to hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that I hold. <q>And a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to mine acquaintance.</q> And into my very acquaintance I struck <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> by the example of my dreadful tribulation. <q>They that did see me, fled without from me.</q> Because they did not understand my inward and invisible hope, they fled from me into things outward and visible.</p>

<p>13. <q>I have been forgotten, as one dead from the heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse12">Psalm 30:12</a></span>. And they have forgotten me, as if I were dead from their hearts. <q>I have become as a lost vessel.</q> I have seemed to myself to be lost to all the Lord's service, living in this world, and gaining none, when all were afraid to join themselves unto me.</p>

<p>14. <q>For I have heard the rebuking of many dwelling by in a circuit</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse13">Psalm 30:13</a></span>. For I have heard many rebuking me, in the pilgrimage of this world near me, following the circuit of time, and refusing to return with me to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> country. <q>Whilst they were assembling themselves together against me, they conspired that they might take my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> That my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which should by death easily escape from their power, might consent unto them, they imagined a device, whereby they would not suffer me even to die.</p>

<p>15. <q>But I have hoped in You, O Lord; I have said, You are my God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse14">Psalm 30:14</a></span>. For You have not changed, that You should not save, Who dost correct.</p>

<p>16. <q>In Your hands</q> are <q>my lots</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse15">Psalm 30:15</a></span>. In Your power are my lots. For I see no desert for which out of the universal ungodliness of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> You have elected me particularly to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And though there be with You some just and secret order in my election, yet I, from whom this is hid, have attained by lot unto my Lord's vesture. <span class="stiki" id="note180685"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;19:24</a></span> <q>Deliver me from the hands of mine enemies, and from them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> me.</q></p>

<p>17. <q>Make Your Face to shine upon Your servant</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse16">Psalm 30:16</a></span>. Make it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who do not think that I belong unto You, that Your Face is bent upon me, and that I serve You. <q>Save me in Your mercy.</q></p>

<p>18. <q>O Lord, let me not be confounded, for I have called upon You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse17">Psalm 30:17</a></span>. O Lord, let me not be put to shame by those who insult me, for that I have called upon You. <q>Let the ungodly be ashamed, and be brought down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> Let them rather who call upon stones be ashamed, and made to dwell with darkness. </p>

<p>19. <q>Let the deceitful lips be made dumb</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse18">Psalm 30:18</a></span>. In making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the peoples Your <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> wrought in me, strike with dumb amazement the lips of them that invent <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of me. <q>Which speak iniquity against the Righteous, in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and contempt.</q> Which speak iniquity against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and contempt of Him as a crucified man.</p>

<p>20. <q>How great</q> is <q>the multitude of Your sweetness, O Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse19">Psalm 30:19</a></span>. Here the Prophet exclaims, having sight of all this, and admiring how manifoldly plenteous is Your sweetness, O Lord. <q>Which You have hid for them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> You.</q> Even those, whom Thou correctest, You love much: but lest they should go on negligently from relaxed security, Thou hidest from them the sweetness of Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for whom it is profitable to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> You. <q>You have perfected it for them that hope in You.</q> But You have perfected this sweetness for them that hope in You. For Thou dost not withdraw from them what they look for perseveringly even unto the end. <q>In sight of the sons of men.</q> For it does not escape the notice of the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who now live no more after Adam, but after the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>. <q>You will hide them in the hidden place of Your Countenance:</q> which seat You shall preserve for everlasting in the hidden place of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of You for them that hope in You. <q>From the troubling of men.</q> So that now they suffer no more trouble from men.</p>

<p>21. <q>You will protect them in Your tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse20">Psalm 30:20</a></span>. But here meanwhile while <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongues murmur against them, saying, Who has come thence? You will protect them in the tabernacle, that of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in those things, which the Lord wrought and endured for us in time.</p>

<p>22. <q>Blessed be the Lord; for He has made His mercy marvellous, in the city of compassing</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse21">Psalm 30:21</a></span>. Blessed be the Lord, for after the correction of the sharpest <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> He has made His mercy marvellous to all throughout the world, in the circuit of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society. </p>

<p>23. <q>I said in my <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a></q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse22">Psalm 30:22</a></span>. Whence that people again speaking says, I said in my <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> were raging horribly against me. <q>I have been cast forth from the sight of Your eyes.</q> For if You had regard to me, You would not suffer me to endure these things. <q>Therefore You heard, O Lord, the voice of my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, when I cried unto You.</q> Therefore putting a limit to correction, and showing that I have part in Your care, You heard, O Lord, the voice of my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, when I raised it high  out of tribulation.</p>

<p>24. <q>Love the Lord, all you His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse23">Psalm 30:23</a></span>. The Prophet again exhorts, having sight of these things, and says, <q>Love the Lord, all you His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; for the Lord will require <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Since <q>if the righteous shall scarcely be saved, where shall the sinner and the ungodly appear?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180690"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:18</a></span> <q>And He will repay them that do exceeding proudly.</q> And He will repay them who even when conquered are not converted, because they are very <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>.</p>

<p>25. <q>Quit you like men, and let your heart be strengthened</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa030.htm#verse24">Psalm 30:24</a></span>: working good without fainting, that you may reap in due season. <q>All you who trust in the Lord:</q> that is, you who duly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and worship Him, trust ye in the Lord.</p>
