<h1>Exposition on Psalm 32</h1>


<p>To David himself; for understanding.</p>

<p>1. To David himself; for understanding; by which it is understood that not by the merits of works, but by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, man is delivered, confessing his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>2. <q>Blessed are they whose unrighteousness is forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse1">Psalm 31:1</a></span>: and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are buried in oblivion. <q>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor is there guile in his mouth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse2">Psalm 31:2</a></span>: nor has he in his mouth boastings of righteousness, when his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>3. <q>Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old:</q> because I made not with my mouth <q>confession unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180692"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;10:10</a></span> all firmness in me has grown old in infirmity. <q>Through my roaring all the day long</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse3">Psalm 31:3</a></span>: when I was ungodly and a blasphemer, crying against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though defending and excusing my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>4. <q>Because day and night Your Hand was heavy upon me:</q> because, through the continual punishment of Your scourges, <q>I was turned in misery, while a thorn was fixed through me</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse4">Psalm 31:4</a></span>: I was made miserable by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> my misery, being pricked with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</p>

<p>5. <q>I acknowledged my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and my unrighteousness have I not hid:</q> that is, my unrighteousness have I not concealed.  <q>I said, I will confess against myself my unrighteousness to the Lord:</q> I said, I will confess, not against God (as in my ungodly crying, when I kept silence), but against myself, my unrighteousness to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <q>And Thou forgavest the iniquity of my heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse5">Psalm 31:5</a></span>; hearing the word of confession in the heart, before it was uttered with the voice.</p>

<p>6. <q>For this shall every one that is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto You in an acceptable time:</q> for this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of heart shall every one that is righteous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto You. For not by their own merits will they be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but by that acceptable time, that is, at His coming, who redeemed us from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>Nevertheless in the flood of great waters they shall not come near him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse6">Psalm 31:6</a></span>: nevertheless, let none think, when the end has come suddenly, as in the days of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note180694"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;24:37-41</a></span> that there remains a place of confession, whereby he may draw near unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>7. <q>You are my refuge from the pressures, which have compassed me about:</q> You are my refuge from the pressure of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which has compassed my heart. <q>O Thou, my Rejoicing, deliver me from them that compass me about</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse7">Psalm 31:7</a></span>: in You is my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: deliver me from the sorrow which my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> bring upon me.</p>

<p>8. <em>Diapsalma.</em> The answer of God: <q>I will give you understanding, and will set you in the way in which you shall go;</q> I will give you understanding after confession, that you depart not from the way in which you should go; lest you wish to be in your own power. <q>I will fix Mine Eyes upon you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse8">Psalm 31:8</a></span>; so will make sure upon you My Love.</p>

<p>9. <q>Be not ye like horse or mule, which have no understanding:</q> and therefore would govern themselves. But says the Prophet, <q>Hold in their jaws with bit and bridle.</q> Do Thou then, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, unto them <q>that will not come near You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse9">Psalm 31:9</a></span>, what man does to horse and mule, that by scourges Thou make them to bear Your rule.</p>

<p>10. <q>Many are the scourges of the sinner:</q> much is he scourged, who, confessing not his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, would be his own ruler. <q>But he that trusts in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, mercy compasses him about</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse10">Psalm 31:10</a></span>; but he that trusts in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and submits himself to His rule, mercy shall compass him about.</p>

<p>11. <q>Be glad in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, you righteous:</q> be glad, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, you righteous, not in yourselves, but in the Lord. <q>And <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, all you that are right in heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa031.htm#verse11">Psalm 31:11</a></span>: and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in Him, all you who understand that it is right to be subject unto Him, that so ye may be placed above all things beside.</p>
