<h1>Exposition on Psalm 4</h1>

<p>To the end, a psalm song to  David.</p>

<p>1. <q>Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180085"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> For this <q>end</q> signifies perfection, not consumption. Now it may be a question, whether every Song be a Psalm, or rather every Psalm a Song; whether there are some Songs which cannot be called Psalms, and some Psalms which cannot be called Songs. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> must be attended to, if haply <q>Song</q> do not denote a joyful theme. But those are called Psalms which are sung to the Psaltery; which the history as a high <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> declares the Prophet David to have used.  Of which matter this is not the place to discourse; for it requires prolonged inquiry, and much discussion. Now meanwhile we must look either for the words of the Lord Man  after the Resurrection, or of man in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> believing and hoping on Him.</p>

<p>2. <q>When I called, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of my righteousness heard me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse1">Psalm 4:1</a></span>. When I called, God heard me, the Psalmist says, of whom is my righteousness. <q>In tribulation You have enlarged me.</q> You have led me from the straits of sadness into the broad ways of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For, <q>tribulation and straitness is on every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man that does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180088"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;2:9</a></span> But he who says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in tribulations, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that tribulation works patience;</q> up to that where he says, <q>Because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given unto us;</q>  he has no straits of heart, they be heaped on him outwardly by them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> him. Now the change of person, for that from the third person, where he says, <q>He heard,</q> he passes at once to the second, where he says, <q>You have enlarged me;</q> if it be not done for the sake of variety and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it is strange why the Psalmist should first wish to declare to men that he had been heard, and afterwards address Him who heard him. Unless perchance, when he had declared how he was heard, in this very enlargement of heart he preferred to speak with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that he might even in this way show what it is to be enlarged in heart, that is, to have God already shed abroad in the heart, with whom he might hold converse interiorly. Which is rightly understood as spoken in the person of him who, believing on Christ, has been enlightened; but in that of the very Lord Man, whom the Wisdom of God took, I do not see how this can be suitable. For He was never deserted by It. But as His very <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> against trouble is a sign rather of our infirmity, so also of that sudden enlargement of heart the same Lord may speak for His faithful ones, whom He has personated also when He said, <q>I was an hungered, and you gave Me no meat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me no drink,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180090"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;25:42</a></span> and so forth. Wherefore here also He can say, <q>You have enlarged me,</q> for one of the least of His, holding converse with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a></q> he has <q>shed abroad in his heart by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180091"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> <q>Have mercy upon me and hear my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</q> Why does he again ask, when already he declared that he had been heard and enlarged? It is for our sakes, of whom it is said, <q>But if we hope for that we see not, we wait in patience;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180092"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;8:25</a></span> or is it, that in him who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that which is begun may be perfected?</p>

<p>3. <q>O you sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, how long heavy in heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse2">Psalm 4:2</a></span>. Let your  <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, says he, have lasted at least up to the coming of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; why then any longer are you heavy in heart? When will you make an end of crafty  wiles, if now when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is present ye make it not? <q>Why do ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> vanity, and seek a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>?</q> Why would ye be blessed by the lowest things? Truth alone, from which all things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, makes blessed. For, <q>vanity is of deceivers, and all is vanity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180094"><a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;1:2</a></span> <q>What profit has a man of all his labour, wherewith he labours under the sun?</q> Why then are you held back by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of things temporal? Why follow ye after the last things, as though the first, which is vanity and a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>? For you would have them abide with you, which all pass away, as does a shadow.</p>

<p>4. <q>And <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that the Lord has magnified his Holy One</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse3">Psalm 4:3</a></span>. Whom but Him, whom He raised up from below, and placed in heaven at His right hand? Therefore does he chide <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, that they would turn at length from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of this world to Him. But if the addition of the conjunction (for he says, <q>and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye</q>) is to any a difficulty, he may easily observe in Scripture that this manner of speech is usual in that language, in which the Prophets spoke. For you often find this beginning, <q>And</q> the Lord said unto him, <q>And</q> the word of the Lord came to him. Which joining by a conjunction, when no sentence has gone before, to which the following one may be annexed, perhaps admirably conveys to us, that the utterance of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in words is connected with that vision which goes on in the heart. Although in this place it may be said, that the former sentence, <q>Why do ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> vanity, and seek a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>?</q> is as if it were written, Do not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> vanity, and seek a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. And being thus read, it follows in the most direct construction, <q>and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that the Lord has magnified His Holy One.</q> But the interposition of the <em>Diapsalma</em> forbids our joining this sentence with the preceding one. For whether this be a Hebrew word, as some would have it, which means, so be it; or a Greek word, which marks a pause in the psalmody (so as that Psalma should be what is sung in psalmody, but Diapsalma an interval of silence in the psalmody; that as the coupling of voices in singing is called Sympsalma, so their separation Diapsalma, where a certain pause of interrupted continuity is marked): whether I say it be the former, or the latter, or something else, this at least is probable, that the sense cannot rightly be continued and joined, where the Diapsalma intervenes. </p>

<p>5. <q>The Lord will hear me, when I cry unto Him.</q> I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we are here warned, that with great earnestness of heart, that is, with an inward and incorporeal cry, we should implore help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as we must give thanks for enlightenment in this life, so must we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for rest after this life. Wherefore in the person, either of the faithful preacher of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, or of our Lord Himself, it may be taken, as if it were written, the Lord will hear you, when you cry unto Him.</p>

<p>6. <q>Be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse4">Psalm 4:4</a></span>. For the thought occurred, Who is worthy to be heard? Or how shall the sinner not cry in vain unto the Lord? Therefore, <q>Be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>,</q> says he, <q>and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not.</q> Which may be taken two ways: either, even if you be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that is, even if there arise an emotion in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which now by reason of the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not in our power, at least let not the reason and the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is after God regenerated within, that with the mind we should serve the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although with the flesh we as yet serve the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note180096"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;7:25</a></span> consent thereunto; or, repent ye, that is, be ye <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with yourselves for your past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and henceforth cease to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>What you say in your hearts:</q> there is understood, <q>say ye:</q> so that the complete sentence is, <q>What ye say in your hearts, that say ye;</q> that is, be ye not the people of whom it is said, <q>with their lips they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Me, but their heart is far from Me. <span class="stiki" id="note180097"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> In your chambers be ye pricked.</q> This is what has been expressed already <q>in heart.</q> For this is the chamber, of which our Lord warns us, that we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> within, with closed doors. <span class="stiki" id="note180098"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;6:6</a></span> But, <q>be ye pricked,</q> refers either to the pain of repentance, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in punishment should prick itself, that it be not condemned and tormented in God's judgment; or, to arousing, that we should awake to behold the light of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as if pricks were made use of. But some say that not, <q>be ye pricked,</q> but, <q>be ye opened,</q> is the better reading; because in the Greek Psalter it is <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x1F7B;&#x03B3;&#x03B7;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;</span>, which refers to that enlargement of the heart, in order that the shedding abroad of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> may be received.</p>

<p>7. <q>Offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of righteousness, and hope in the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse5">Psalm 4:5</a></span>. He says the same in another Psalm, <q>the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for God is a troubled spirit.</q>  Wherefore that this is the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of righteousness which is offered through repentance it is not unreasonably here understood. For what more righteous, than that each one should be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, rather than those of others, and that in self-punishment he should <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> himself unto God? Or are righteous works after repentance the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of righteousness? For the interposition of <em> Diapsalma</em>  not unreasonably perhaps intimates even a transition from the old life to the new life: that on the old man being destroyed or weakened by repentance, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of righteousness, according to the regeneration of the new man, may be offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> now cleansed offers and places itself on the altar of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to be encompassed by heavenly fire, that is, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. So that this may be the meaning, <q>Offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of righteousness, and hope in the Lord;</q> that is, live uprightly, and hope for the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in which you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, may shine upon you.</p>

<p>8. But yet, <q>hope in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,</q> is as yet expressed without  explanation. Now what is hoped for, but <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? But since each one would obtain from God that good, which he loves; and they are not easy to be found who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> interior goods, that is, which belong to the inward man, which alone should be loved, but the rest are to be used for necessity, not to be enjoyed for pleasure; excellently did he subjoin, when he had said, <q>hope in the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse6">Psalm 4:6</a></span>, <q>Many say, Who shows us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q> This is the speech, and this the daily inquiry of all the foolish and unrighteous; whether of those who long for the peace and quiet of a worldly life, and from the frowardness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> find it not; who even in their blindness dare to find fault with the order of events, when involved in their own deservings they deem the times worse than these which are past: or, of those who <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and despair of that future life, which is promised us; who are often saying, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> if it's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Or, who ever came from below, to tell us this? Very exquisitely then, and briefly, he shows (to those, that is, who have interior sight), what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are to be sought; answering their question, who say, <q>Who shows us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q> <q>The light of Your countenance,</q> says he, <q>is stamped on us, O Lord.</q> This light is the whole and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> good of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which is seen not with the eye, but with the mind. But he says, <q>stamped on us,</q> as a penny is stamped with the king's image. For man was made after the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note180102"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;1:26</a></span> which he defaced by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: therefore it is his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> good, if by a new birth he be stamped. And I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this to be the bearing of that which some understand skilfully; I mean, what the Lord said on seeing C&aelig;sar's tribute money, <q>Render to C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's; and to God the things that are God's.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180103"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;22:21</a></span> As if He had said, In like manner as C&aelig;sar exacts from you the impression of his image, so also does God: that as the tribute money is rendered to him, so should the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, illumined and stamped with the light of His countenance. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse7">Psalm 4:7</a></span> <q>You have put <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> into my heart.</q> Gladness then is not to be sought without by them, who, being still heavy in heart, <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> vanity, and seek a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>;</q> but within, where the light of God's countenance is stamped. For Christ dwells in the inner man, <span class="stiki" id="note180104"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse16">Ephesians&nbsp;3:16-17</a></span> as the Apostle says; for to Him does it appertain to see <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since He has said, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180105"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> And again, when He spoke in the Apostle, saying, <q>Would you receive a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who speaks in me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180106"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> He spoke not of course from without to him, but in his very heart, that is, in that chamber where we are to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.</p>

<p>9. But men (who doubtless are many) who follow after things temporal, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not to say anything else, than, <q>Who shows us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q> when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and certain good within their very selves they cannot see. Of these accordingly is most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> said, what he adds next: <q>From the time of His grain, of wine, and oil, they have been multiplied.</q> For the addition of His, is not superfluous. For the grain is God's: inasmuch as He is <q>the living bread which came down from heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180107"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span> The wine too is God's: for, <q>they shall be inebriated,</q> he says, <q>with the fatness of your house.</q>  The oil too is God's: of which it is said, <q>You have fattened my head with oil.</q>  But those many, who say, <q>Who shows us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q> and who see not that the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is within them: these, <q>from the time of His grain, of wine, and oil, are multiplied.</q> For multiplication does not always betoken plentifulness, and not, generally, scantiness: when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, given up to temporal pleasures, burns ever with desire, and cannot be satisfied; and, distracted with manifold and anxious thought, is not permitted to see the simple good. Such is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of which it is said, <q>For the corruptible body presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the earthly tabernacle weighs down the mind that muses on many things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180110"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> A <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> like this, by the departure and succession of temporal goods, that is, <q>from the time of His grain, wine, and oil,</q> filled with numberless idle fancies, is so multiplied, that it cannot do that which is commanded, <q>Think on the Lord in goodness, and in simplicity of heart seek Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180111"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;1:1</a></span> For this multiplicity is strongly opposed to that simplicity. And therefore leaving these, who are many, multiplied, that is, by the desire of things temporal, and who say, <q>Who shows us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q> which are to be sought not with the eyes without, but with simplicity of heart within, the faithful man rejoices and says, <q>In peace, together, I will sleep, and take rest</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa004.htm#verse8">Psalm 4:8</a></span>. For such men <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> hope for all manner of estrangement of mind from things mortal, and forgetfulness of this world's miseries; which is beautifully and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> signified under the name of sleep and rest, where the most perfect peace cannot be interrupted by any tumult. But this is not had now in this life, but is to be hoped for after this life. This even the words themselves, which are in the future tense, show us. For it is not said, either, I have slept, and taken rest; or, I do sleep, and take rest; but, <q>I will sleep, and take rest.</q> Then shall <q>this corruptible put on incorruption, and this mortal shall put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; then shall death be swallowed up in victory.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180112"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:54</a></span> Hence it is said, <q>But if we hope for that we see not, we wait in patience.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180113"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;8:25</a></span> </p>

<p>10. Wherefore, consistently with this, he adds the last words, and says, <q>Since  You, O Lord, in singleness hast made me dwell in hope.</q> Here he does not say, wilt make; but, <q>hast made.</q> In whom then this hope now is, there will be assuredly that which is hoped for. And well does he say, <q>in singleness.</q> For this may refer in opposition to those many, who being multiplied from the time of His grain, of wine, and oil, say, <q>Who shows us <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q> For this multiplicity perishes, and singleness is observed among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: of whom it is said in the Acts of the Apostles, <q>and of the multitude of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, there was one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and one heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180114"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32</a></span> In singleness, then, and simplicity, removed, that is, from the multitude and crowd of things, that are born and die, we ought to be lovers of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and unity, if we desire to cleave to the <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> and our Lord.</p>
