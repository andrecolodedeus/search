<h1>Exposition on Psalm 47</h1>


<p>1. The title of the Psalm goes thus. <q>To the end: for the sons of Korah: a Psalm of David himself.</q> These sons of Korah have the title also of some other Psalms, and indicate a sweet <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, insinuate a great Sacrament: wherein let us willingly understand ourselves, and let us acknowledge in the title us who hear, and read, and as in a glass set before us behold who we are. The sons of Korah, who are they?. ..Haply the sons of the Bridegroom. For the Bridegroom was crucified in the place of Calvary. Recollect the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note181514"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;27:33</a></span> where they crucified the Lord, and you will find Him crucified in the place of Calvary. Furthermore, they who deride His Cross, by devils, as by beasts, are devoured. For this also a certain Scripture signified. When God's Prophet Elisha was going up, children called after him mocking, <q>Go up thou bald head, Go up thou bald head:</q> but he, not so much in cruelty as in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, made those children to be devoured by bears out of the wood. <span class="stiki" id="note181515"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse23">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;2:23-24</a></span> If those children had not been devoured, would they have lived even till now? Or could they not, being born mortal, have been taken off by a fever? But so in them had no <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> been shown, whereby posterity might be put in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Let none then mock the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were possessed by devils, and devoured; for in the place of Calvary, crucifying Christ, and lifting on the Cross, they said as it were with childish sense, not understanding what they said, <q>Go up, thou bald head.</q> For what is, <q>Go up</q>? <q>Crucify Him, Crucify Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181516"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;23:21</a></span> For childhood is set before us to imitate humility, and childhood is set before us to beware of foolishness. To imitate humility, childhood was set before us by the Lord, when He called children to Him, <span class="stiki" id="note181517"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;18:2</a></span> and because they were kept from Him, He said, <q>Suffer them to come unto Me, for of such is the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181518"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;19:14</a></span> The example of childhood is set before us to beware of foolishness by the Apostle, <q>Brethren, be not children in understanding:</q> and again he proposes it to imitate, <q>Howbeit in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> be ye children, that in understanding ye may be men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181519"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:20</a></span> <q>For the sons of Korah</q> the Psalm is sung; for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> then is it sung. Let us hear it as sons of the Bridegroom, whom senseless children crucified in the place of Calvary. For they earned to be devoured by beasts; we to be crowned by Angels. For we acknowledge the humility of our Lord, and of it are not ashamed. We are not ashamed of Him called in <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> <q>the bald</q> (<em>Calvus</em>), from the place of Calvary. For on the very Cross whereon He was insulted, He permitted not our forehead to be bald; for with His own Cross He marked it. Finally, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these things are said to us, see what is said.</p>

<p>2. <q>O clap your hands, all you nations</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse1">Psalm 46:1</a></span>. Were the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> all the nations? No, but blindness in part is happened to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that senseless children might cry, <q>Calve,</q> <q>Calve;</q> and so the Lord might be crucified in the place of Calvary, that by His Blood shed He might redeem the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and that might be fulfilled which says the Apostle, <q>Blindness in part is happened unto <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, until the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> be come in.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181520"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;11:25</a></span> Let them insult, then, the vain, and foolish, and senseless, and say, <q>Calve,</q> <q>Calve;</q> but you redeemed by His Blood which was shed in the place of Calvary, say, <q>O clap your hands, all you nations;</q> because to you has come down the Grace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>O clap your hands.</q> What is <q>O clap</q>? Rejoice. But wherefore with the hands? Because with good works. Do not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with the mouth while idle with the hands. If you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, <q>clap your hands.</q> The hands of the nations let Him see, who joys has deigned to give them. What is, the hands of the nations? The acts of them doing good works. <q>O clap your hands, all you nations: shout unto God with the voice of triumph.</q> Both with voice and with hands. If with the voice only it is not well, because the hands are slow; if only with the hands it is not well, because the tongue is mute. Agree together must the hands and tongue. Let this confess, these work. <q>Shout unto God with the voice of triumph.</q></p>

<p>3. <q>For the Lord Most High is terrible</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse2">Psalm 46:2</a></span>. The Most High in descending made like one ludicrous, by ascending into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is made terrible. <q>A great King over all the earth.</q> Not only over the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; for over them also He is King. For of them also the Apostles <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and of them many thousands of men sold their goods, and laid the price at the Apostles' feet, <span class="stiki" id="note181521"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse34">Acts&nbsp;4:34</a></span> and in them was fulfilled what in the title of the Cross was written, <q>The King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181522"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;27:37</a></span> For He is King also of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But <q>of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></q> is little.  <q>O clap your hands, all you nations: for God is the King of all the earth.</q> For it suffices not Him to have under Him one nation: therefore such great price gave He out of His side, as to buy the whole world.</p>

<p>4. <q>He has subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse3">Psalm 46:3</a></span>. Which subdued, and to whom? Who are they that speak? Haply <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Surely, if Apostles; surely, if Saints. For under these God has subdued the people and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, that today are they honoured among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, who by their own citizens earned to be slain: as their Lord was slain by His citizens, and is honoured among the nations; was crucified by His own, is adored by aliens, but those by a price made His own. For therefore bought He us, that aliens from Him we might not be. Do you think then these are the words of Apostles, <q>He has subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet</q>? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. Strange that Apostles should speak so proudly, as to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that the nations were put under their feet, that is, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> under the feet of Apostles. For they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that we are with them under the feet of Him who died for us. For under <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> feet ran they, who would be of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, to whom He said, <q>Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> crucified for you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181524"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> What then here, what are we to understand? <q>He has subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet.</q> All pertaining to Christ's inheritance are among <q>all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>,</q> and all not pertaining to Christ's inheritance are among <q>all the nations:</q> and you see so exalted in Christ's Name is Christ's Church, that all not yet believing in Christ lie under the feet of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For what numbers now run to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; not yet being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they ask aid of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>;  to be succoured by us temporally they are willing, though <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> to reign with us as yet they are unwilling. When all seek aid of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even they who are not yet in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has He not <q>subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet</q>?</p>

<p>5. <q>He has chosen an inheritance for us, the excellency  of Jacob, whom He loved</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse4">Psalm 46:4</a></span>. A certain beauty of Jacob He has chosen for our inheritance. <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> and Jacob were two brothers; in their mother's womb both struggled, and by this struggle their mother's bowels were shaken; and while they two were yet therein, the younger was elected and preferred to the elder, and it was said, <q>Two peoples are in your womb, and the elder shall serve the younger.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181527"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;25:23</a></span> Among all nations is the elder, among all nations the younger; but the younger is in good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, elect, godly, faithful; the elder in the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, unworthy, sinful, stubborn, defending rather than confessing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: as was also the very people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181528"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3</a></span> But for that it is said, <q>The elder shall serve the younger;</q> it is manifest that under the godly are subdued the ungodly, under the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> are subdued the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> was born first, and Jacob was born last; but he who was last born, was preferred to the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, who through <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> lost his birthright. So you have it written, <span class="stiki" id="note181529"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;25:30-34</a></span> He longed for the pottage, and his brother said to him, If you will that I give it you, give me your birthright. He loved more that which carnally he desired, than that which spiritually by being born first he had earned:  and he laid aside his birthright, that he might eat lentils. But lentils we find to be the food of the Egyptians, for there it abounds in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Whence is so magnified the lentil of Alexandria, that it comes even to our country, as if here grew no lentil. Therefore by desiring <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> food he lost his birthright. So also the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, of whom it is said, <q>in their hearts they turned back again into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181531"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse39">Acts&nbsp;7:39</a></span> They desired in a manner the lentil, and lost their birthright.</p>

<p>6. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is gone up with jubilation</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse5">Psalm 46:5</a></span>. Even He our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord Christ, is gone up with jubilation; <q>the Lord with the sound of a trumpet.</q> <q>Is gone up:</q> whither, save where we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? Whither the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> followed Him not, even with their eyes. For exalted on the Cross they mocked Him, ascending into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> they did not see Him. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has gone up with jubilation.</q> What is jubilation, but admiration of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which cannot be expressed in words? As the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> admired, seeing Him go into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, whom they had mourned dead; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, words sufficed not: remained to jubilate what none could express. There was also the voice of the trumpet, the voice of Angels. For it is said, <q>Lift up your voice like a trumpet.</q> Angels preached the ascension of the Lord: they saw the Disciples, their Lord ascending, tarrying, admiring, confounded, nothing speaking, but in heart jubilant: and now was the sound of the trumpet in the clear voice of the Angels, <q>You men of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, why stand ye gazing up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>? This is Jesus.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181532"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;1:11</a></span> As if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that it was the same Jesus. Had they not just before seen Him before them? Had they not heard Him speaking with them? Nay, they not only saw the figure of Him present, but handled also His limbs. Of themselves then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> they not, that it was the same Jesus? But they being by very admiration, from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of jubilation, as it were transported in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the Angels said, <q>that same is Jesus.</q> As though they said, If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him, this is that same Jesus, whom crucified, your feet stumbled, whom dead and buried, you thought your hope lost. Lo, this is the same Jesus. He has gone up before you, <q>He shall so come in like manner as you have seen Him go into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> His Body is removed indeed from your eyes, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is not separated from your hearts: see Him going up, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him absent, hope for Him coming; but yet through His secret Mercy, feel Him present. For He who ascended into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> that He might be removed from your eyes, promised unto you, saying, <q>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181533"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> Justly then the Apostle so addressed us, <q>The Lord is at hand; be careful for nothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181534"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse5">Philippians&nbsp;4:5-6</a></span> Christ sits above the Heavens; the Heavens are far off, He who there sits is near....</p>

<p>7. <q>Sing praises to our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sing praises</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse6">Psalm 46:6</a></span>. Whom as Man mocked they, who from God were alienated. <q>Sing praises to our God.</q> For He is not Man only, but God. Man of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note181535"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;1:3</a></span> God the Lord of David, of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> having flesh. <q>Whose</q> (says the Apostle) <q>are the fathers, of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181536"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> Of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> then is Christ, but according to the flesh. But who is this Christ who is of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> according to the flesh? <q>Who is over all, God blessed for ever.</q> God before the flesh, God in the flesh, God with the flesh. Nor only God before the flesh, but God before the earth whence flesh was made; nor only God before the earth whereof flesh was made, but even God before the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> which was first made; God before the day which was first made; God before Angels; the same Christ is God: for <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181537"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> </p>

<p>8. <q>For God is the King of all the earth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse7">Psalm 46:7</a></span>. What? And before was He not God of all the earth? Is He not God of both heaven and earth, since by Him surely were all things made? Who can say that He is not his God? But not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> acknowledged Him their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and where He was acknowledged, there only, so to say, He was God. <q>In Judah is God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q>  Not yet was it said to the sons of Korah, <q>O clap your hands, all you nations.</q> For that God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Judah, is King of all the earth: now by all He is acknowledged, for that is fulfilled which Isaiah says, <q>He is your God who has delivered you, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the whole earth shall He be called.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181539"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;54:5</a></span> <q>Sing ye praises with understanding.</q> He teaches us and warns us to sing praises with understanding, not to seek the sound of the ear, but the light of the heart. The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, whence you were called that you might be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, adored gods made with hands, and sang praises to them, but not with understanding. If they had sung with understanding, they had not adored stones. When a man sensible sang to a stone insensible, did he sing with understanding? But now, brethren, we see not with our eyes Whom we adore, and yet correctly  we adore.  Much more is God commended to us, that with our eyes we see Him not. If with our eyes we saw Him, haply we might despise. For even Christ seen, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> despised; unseen, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> adored.</p>

<p>9. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall reign over all nations</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse8">Psalm 46:8</a></span>. Who reigned over one nation, <q>shall reign</q> (says He) <q>over all nations.</q> When this was said, God reigned over one nation. It was a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, the thing was not yet shown. Thanks be to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we now see fulfilled what before was prophesied. A written promise God sent unto us before the time, the time fulfilled He has repaid us. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall reign over all nations,</q> is a promise. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sits upon His Holy Seat.</q> What then was promised to come, now being fulfilled, is acknowledged and held. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sits upon His Holy Seat.</q> What is His Holy Seat? Haply says one, The Heavens, and he understands well. For Christ has gone up, <span class="stiki" id="note181542"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;1:2</a></span> as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, with the Body, wherein He was crucified, and sits at the right hand of the Father; thence we expect Him to come to judge the quick and the dead. <span class="stiki" id="note181543"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:1</a></span> <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sits upon His Holy Seat.</q> The Heavens are His Holy Seat. Will you also be His Seat? Think not that you can not be; prepare for Him a place in your heart. He comes, and willingly sits. The same Christ is surely <q>the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Wisdom of God:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181544"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> and what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> of Wisdom Herself?

And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, brethren, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who live well, who act well, converse in godly charity, does not God sit in them, and Himself command? Your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> obeys God sitting in it, and itself commands the members. For your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> commands your members, that so may move the foot, the hand, the eye, the ear, and itself commands the members as its servants, but yet itself serves its Lord sitting within. It cannot well rule its inferior, unless its superior it have not disdained to serve.</p>

<p>10. <q>The princes of the peoples are gathered together unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa046.htm#verse9">Psalm 46:9</a></span>. The God of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob. <span class="stiki" id="note181546"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;3:6</a></span> True it is, God said this, and thereupon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> prided themselves, and said, <q>We are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181547"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;8:33</a></span> priding themselves in their father's name, carrying his flesh, not holding his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; by seed cleaving to Him, in manners degenerating. But the Lord, what said He to them so priding themselves? <q>If you are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> children, do the works of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181548"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;8:39</a></span> Again...<q>The princes of the peoples:</q> the princes of the nations: not the princes of one people, but the princes of all people have <q>gathered together unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> Of these princes was that Centurion too, of whom but now when the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was read ye heard. For he was a Centurion having <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and power among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he was a prince among the princes of the peoples. Christ coming to him, he sent his friends to meet Him, nay unto Christ <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> passing over to him he sent his friends, and asked that He would heal his servant who was dangerously sick. And when the Lord would come, he sent to Him this message: <q>I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof, but say in a word only, and my servant shall be healed.</q> <q>For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181549"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse6">Luke&nbsp;7:6-7</a></span> See how he kept his rank! First he mentioned that he was under another, and afterwards that another was under him. I am under authority, and I am in authority; both under some I am, and over some I am....As though he said, If I being set under authority command those who are under me, You who is set under no man's authority, canst not Thou command Your creature, since all things were made by You, and without You was nothing made. <q>Say,</q> then, said he, <q>in a word, and my servant shall be healed. For I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.</q>...Admiring at his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, Jesus reprobates the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> misbelief. For sound to themselves they seemed, whereas they were dangerously sick, when their Physician not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> they slew. Therefore when He reprobated, and repudiated their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> what said he? <q>I say unto you, that many shall come from the east and west,</q> not belonging to the kindred of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: many shall come to whom He said, <q>O clap your hands, all you nations;</q> <q>and shall sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> begot them not of his own flesh; yet shall they come and sit down with him in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and be his sons. Whereby his sons? Not as born of his flesh, but by following his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>But the children of the kingdom,</q> that is, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>shall be cast into outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181550"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;8:12</a></span> They shall be condemned to outer darkness who are born of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and they shall sit down with him in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, who have imitated <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>11. And what they who belonged to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? <q>For the mighty gods of the earth are greatly lifted up.</q> They who were gods, the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the vineyard of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereof it is said, <q>Judge between Me and My vineyard,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181551"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;5:3</a></span> shall go into outer darkness, shall not sit down with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and Isaac, and Jacob, are not gathered unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. Wherefore? <q>For the mighty gods of the earth;</q> they who were mighty gods of the earth, presuming upon earth. What earth? Themselves; for every man is earth. For to man was it said, <q>Dust you are, and unto dust shall you return.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note181552"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> But man ought to presume upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thence to hope for help, not from himself. For the earth rains not upon itself, nor shines for itself; but as the earth from heaven expects rain and light, so man from God ought to expect mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. They then, <q>the mighty gods of the earth, were greatly lifted up,</q> that is, greatly prided themselves: they thought no physician necessary for themselves, and therefore remained in their sickness, and by their sickness were brought down even to death. The natural branches were broken off that the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> wild olive tree might be grafted in. <span class="stiki" id="note181553"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;11:17</a></span> Hold we fast then, brethren, humility, charity, godliness: since we are called, on their proving reprobate, even by their example let us <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> ourselves.</p>
