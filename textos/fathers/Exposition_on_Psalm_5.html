<h1>Exposition on Psalm 5</h1>

<p>1. The title of the Psalm is, <q>For her who receives the inheritance.</q> The Church then is signified, who receives for her inheritance <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; that she may possess God Himself, in cleaving to whom she may be blessed, according to that, <q>Blessed are the meek, for they shall possess the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180115"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;5:5</a></span> What earth, but that of which it is said, <q>You are my hope, my portion in the land of the living</q>?  And again more clearly, <q>The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup.</q>  And conversely the word Church is said to be God's inheritance according to that, <q>Ask of Me, and I shall give you the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for your inheritance.</q>  Therefore is God said to be our inheritance, because He feeds and sustains  us: and we are said to be God's inheritance, because He orders and rules us. Wherefore it is the voice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in this Psalm called to her inheritance, that she too may herself become the inheritance of the Lord.</p>

<p>2. <q>Hear my words, O Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse1">Psalm 5:1</a></span>. Being called she calls upon the Lord; that the same Lord being her helper, she may pass through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of this world, and attain unto Him. <q>Understand my cry.</q> The Psalmist well shows what this cry is; how from within, from the chamber of the heart, without the body's utterance,  it reaches unto God: for the bodily voice is heard, but the spiritual is understood. Although this too may be God's hearing, not with carnal ear, but in the omnipresence of His Majesty.</p>

<p>3. <q>Attend      to the voice of my supplication;</q> that is, to that voice, which he makes request that God would understand: of which what the nature is, he has already intimated, when he said, <q>Understand my cry. Attend      to the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse2">Psalm 5:2</a></span>. Although both the Son is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Father <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> together One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and if asked of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, we must give no other answer than that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and when the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are mentioned together, we must understand nothing else, than One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nevertheless Scripture is wont to give the appellation of King to the Son. According then to that which is said, <q>By Me man comes to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180121"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> rightly is it first, <q>my King;</q> and then, <q>my God.</q> And yet has not the Psalmist said, Attend You; but, <q>Attend.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> preaches not two or three Gods, but the Very Trinity, One God. Not that the same Trinity can be together, now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, now the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as Sabellius <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: but that the Father must be none but the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Son none but the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> none but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and this Trinity but One God. Hence when the Apostle had said, <q>Of whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180122"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse36">Romans&nbsp;11:36</a></span> he is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have conveyed an intimation of the Very Trinity; and yet he did not add, to Them be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but, <q>to Him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q></p>

<p>4. <q>Because I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto You <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse3">Psalm 5:3</a></span>. O Lord, in the morning You will hear my voice.</q> What does that, which he said above, <q>Hear Thou,</q> mean, as if he desired to be heard immediately? But now he says, <q>in the morning You will hear;</q> not, hear Thou: and, <q>I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto You;</q> not, I do <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto You: and, as follows, <q>in the morning I will stand by You, and will see;</q> not, I do stand by You, and do see. Unless perhaps his former <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> marks the invocation itself: but being in darkness amidst the storms of this world, he perceives that he does not see what he desires, and yet does not cease to hope, <q>For hope that is seen, is not hope.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180123"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24</a></span> Nevertheless, he understands why he does not see, because the night is not yet past, that is, the darkness which our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have merited. He says therefore, <q>Because I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto You, O Lord;</q> that is, because You are so mighty to whom I shall make my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>in the morning You will hear my voice.</q> You are not He, he says, that can be seen by those, from whose eyes the night of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is not yet withdrawn: when the night then of my <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is past, and the darkness gone, which by my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> I have brought upon myself, then <q>You will hear my voice.</q> Why then did he say above not, <q>You will hear,</q> but <q>hear Thou</q>? Is it that after the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cried out, <q>hear Thou,</q> and was not heard, she perceived what must needs pass away to enable her to be heard? Or is it that she was heard above, but does not yet understand that she was heard, because she does not yet see by whom she has been heard; and what she now says, <q>In the morning You will hear,</q> she would have thus taken, In the morning I shall understand that I have been heard? Such is that expression, <q>Arise, O Lord,</q>  that is, make me arise. But this latter is taken of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> resurrection: but at all events that Scripture, <q>The Lord your God proves you, that He may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180125"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:3</a></span> cannot be taken in any other sense, than, that you by Him may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and that it may be made evident to yourselves, what progress you have made in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>5. <q>In the morning I will stand by You, and will see</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse3">Psalm 5:3</a></span>. What is, <q>I will stand,</q> but <q>I will not lie down</q>? Now what else is, to lie down, but to take rest on the earth, which is a seeking <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in earthly pleasures? <q>I will stand by,</q> he says, <q>and will see.</q> We must not then cleave to things earthly, if we would see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is beheld by a clean heart. <q>For You are not a God who hast pleasure in iniquity. The malignant man shall not dwell near You, nor shall the unrighteous abide before Your eyes. You have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> all that work iniquity, You will destroy all that speak a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. The man of blood, and the crafty man, the Lord will abominate</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse4">Psalm 5:4-6</a></span>. Iniquity, malignity, lying, homicide, craft, and all the like, are the night of which we speak: on the passing away of which, the morning dawns, that God may be seen. He has unfolded the reason, then, why he will stand by in the morning, and see: <q>For,</q> he says, <q>You are not a God who hast pleasure in iniquity.</q> For if He were a God who had pleasure in iniquity, He could be seen even by the iniquitous, so that He would not be seen in the morning, that is, when the night of iniquity is over.</p>

<p>6. <q>The malignant man shall not dwell near You:</q> that is, he shall not so see, as to cleave to You. Hence follows, <q>Nor shall the unrighteous abide before Your eyes.</q> For their eyes, that is, their mind is beaten back by the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because of the darkness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; by the habitual practice of which they are not able to sustain the brightness of right understanding. Therefore even they who see sometimes, that is, who understand the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, are yet still unrighteous, they abide not therein through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of those things, which turn away from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For they carry about with them their night, that is, not only the habit, but even the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, of sinning. But if this night shall pass away, that is, if they shall cease to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and habit thereof be put to flight, the morning dawns, so that they not only understand, but also cleave to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>7. <q>You have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> all that work iniquity.</q> God's <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> may be understood from that form of expression, by which every sinner <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it seems that she too <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> those, whom she suffers not to abide in her. Now they do not abide, who cannot bear the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>You will destroy all that speak a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>.</q> For this is the opposite to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But lest any one should suppose that any substance or nature is opposite to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, let him understand that <q>a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a></q> has relation to that which is not, not to that which is. For if that which is be spoken, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is spoken: but if that which is not be spoken, it is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>.  Therefore says he, <q>You will destroy all that speak a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>;</q> because drawing back from that which is, they turn aside to that which is not. Many lies indeed seem to be for some one's safety or advantage, spoken not in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, but in kindness: such was that of those midwives in Exodus, <span class="stiki" id="note180127"><a href="../bible/exo001.htm#verse19">Exodus&nbsp;1:19</a></span> who gave a false report to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, to the end that the infants of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> might not be slain.  But even these are praised not for the fact, but for the disposition shown; since those who only lie in this way, will attain in time to a freedom from all lying. For in those that are perfect, not even these lies are found. For to these it is said, <q>Let there be in your mouth, yea, yea; nay, nay; whatsoever is more, is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180129"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;5:37</a></span> Nor is it without reason written in another place, <q>The mouth that lies slays the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180130"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse11">Wisdom&nbsp;1:11</a></span> lest any should <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the perfect and spiritual man ought to lie for this temporal life, in the death of which no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is slain, neither his own, nor another's. But since it is one thing to lie, another to conceal the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (if indeed it be one thing to say what is false, another not to say what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>), if haply one does not wish to give a man up even to this visible death, he should be prepared to conceal what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, not to say what is false; so that he may neither give him up, nor yet lie, lest he slay his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for another's body. But if he cannot yet do this, let him at all events admit only lies of such necessity, that he may attain to be freed even from these, if they alone remain, and receive the strength of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whereby he may despise all that must be suffered for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> sake. In fine, there are two kinds of lies, in which there is no great fault,  and yet they are not without fault, either when we are in jest, or when we lie that we may do good. That first kind, in jest, is for this reason not very hurtful, because there is no deception. For he to whom it is said <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it is said for the sake of the jest. But the second kind is for this reason the more inoffensive, because it carries with it some kindly intention. And to say <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that which has no duplicity, cannot even be called a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. As if, for example, a sword be entrusted to any one, and he promises to return it, when he who entrusted it to him shall demand it: if he chance to require his sword when in a fit of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, it is clear it must not be returned then, lest he kill either himself or others, until soundness of mind be restored to him. Here then is no duplicity, because he, to whom the sword was entrusted, when he promised that he would return it at the other's demand, did not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that he could require it when in a fit of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. But even the Lord concealed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when He said to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, not yet strong enough, <q>I have many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180132"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;16:12</a></span> and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> when he said, <q>I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180133"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> Whence it is clear that it is not blamable, sometimes not to speak what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But to say what is false is not found to have been allowed to the perfect.</p>

<p>8. <q>The man of blood, and the crafty man, the Lord will abominate.</q> What he said above, <q>You have <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> all that work iniquity, You will destroy all that speak a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>,</q> may well seem to be repeated here: so that one may refer <q>the man of blood</q> to <q>the worker of iniquity,</q> and <q>the crafty man</q> to the <q>lie.</q> For it is craft, when one thing is done, another pretended. He used an apt word too, when he said, <q>will abominate.</q> For the disinherited are usually called abominated. Now this Psalm is, <q>for her who receives the inheritance;</q> and she adds the exulting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of her hope, in saying, <q>But I, in the multitude of Your mercy, will enter into Your house</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse7">Psalm 5:7</a></span>. <q>In the multitude of mercy:</q> perhaps he means in the multitude of perfected and blessed men, of whom that city shall consist, of which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is now in travail, and is bearing few by few. Now that many men regenerated and perfected, are rightly called the multitude of God's mercy, who can deny; when it is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said, <q>What is man that You are mindful of him, or the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> that  You visit    him?  I will enter into Your house:</q> as a stone into a building, I suppose, is the meaning. For what else is the house of God than the Temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which it is said, <q>for the temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note180135"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> which temple you are</q>? Of which building He is the cornerstone, <span class="stiki" id="note180136"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse20">Ephesians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> whom the Power and Wisdom of God coeternal with the Father assumed.</p>

<p>9. <q>I will worship at Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple, in Your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <q>At the temple,</q> we understand as, <q>near</q> the temple. For he does not say, I will worship <q>in</q> Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple; but, <q>I will worship at Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple.</q> It must be understood too to be spoken not of perfection, but of progress toward perfection: so that the words, <q>I will enter into Your house,</q> should signify perfection. But that this may come to a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> issue, <q>I will</q> first, he says, <q>worship at Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple.</q> And perhaps on this account he added, <q>in Your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>;</q> which is a great defence to those that are advancing toward <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But when any one shall have arrived there, in him comes to pass that which is written, <q>perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180137"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> For they do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him who is now their friend, to whom it is said, <q>henceforth I will not call you servants, but friends,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180138"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;15:15</a></span> when they have been brought through to that which was promised.</p>

<p>10. <q>O Lord, lead me forth in Your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> because of mine enemies</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse8">Psalm 5:8</a></span>. He has here sufficiently plainly declared that he is on his onward road, that is, in progress toward perfection, not yet in perfection itself, when he desires eagerly that he may be led forth. But, <q>in Your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>,</q> not in that which seems so to men. For to return <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> seems <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: but it is not His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of whom it is said, <q>He makes His sun to rise on the good and on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>:</q> for even when God punishes sinners, He does not inflict His <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> on them, but leaves them to their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <q>Behold,</q> the Psalmist says, <q>he travailed with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, he has conceived toil, and brought forth iniquity: he has opened a ditch, and dug it, and has fallen into the pit which he wrought: his pains shall be turned on his own head, and his iniquity shall descend on his own pate.</q>  When then God punishes, He punishes as a judge those that transgress the law, not by bringing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon them from Himself, but driving them on to that which they have chosen, to fill up the sum of their misery. But man, when he returns <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, does it with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will: and on this account is himself first <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, when he would punish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>11. <q>Direct in Your sight my way.</q> Nothing is clearer, than that he here sets forth that time, in which he is journeying onward. For this is a way which is traversed not in any regions of the earth, but in the affections of the heart. <q>In Your sight,</q> he says, <q>direct my way:</q> that is, where no man sees; who are not to be trusted in their praise or blame. For they can in no wise judge of another man's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, wherein the way toward God is traversed. Hence it is added, <q>for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in their mouth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse9">Psalm 5:9</a></span>. To whose judgment of course then there is no trusting, and therefore must we fly within to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Their heart is vain.</q> How then can <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be in their mouth, whose heart is deceived by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Whence men are called back by that voice, <q>Wherefore do ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> vanity, and seek a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>?</q></p>

<p>12. <q>Their throat is an open sepulchre.</q> It may be referred to signify <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, for the sake of which men very often lie by flattery. And admirably has he said, <q>an open sepulchre:</q> for this <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> is ever gaping with open mouth, not as sepulchres, which, on the reception of corpses, are closed up. This also may be understood hereby, that with lying and blind flattery men draw to themselves those whom they entice to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and as it were devour them, when they turn them to their own way of living. And when this happens to them, since by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> they die, those by whom they are led along, are rightly called open sepulchres: for themselves too are in a manner lifeless, being destitute of the life of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and they take in to themselves dead men, whom having slain by <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lying</a> words and a vain heart, they turn unto themselves. <q>With their own tongues they dealt craftily:</q> that is, with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongues. For this seems to be signified, when he says <q>their own.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongues, that is, they speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, when they speak craftily. To whom the Lord says, <q>How can you, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180140"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;12:34</a></span> </p>

<p>13. <q>Judge them, O God: let them fall from their own thoughts</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse10">Psalm 5:10</a></span>. It is a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, not a curse. For he does not wish that it should come to pass; but he perceives what will come to pass. For this happens to them, not because he appears to have wished for it, but because they are such as to deserve that it should happen. For so also what he says afterwards, <q>Let all that hope in You <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>,</q> he says by way of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>; since he perceives that they will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. Likewise is it said <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>, <q>Stir up Your strength, and come:</q>  for he saw that He would come. Although the words, <q>Let them fall from their own thoughts,</q> may be taken thus also, that it may rather be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be a wish for their good by the Psalmist, while they fall from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, that is, that they may no more think <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But what follows, <q>drive them out,</q> forbids this interpretation. For it can in no way be taken in a favourable sense, that one is driven out by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore it is understood to be said <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>, and not of ill will; when this is said, which must necessarily happen to such as chose to persevere in those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which have been mentioned. <q>Let them,</q> therefore, <q>fall from their own thoughts,</q> is, let them fall by their self-accusing thoughts, <q>their own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> also bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>,</q> as the Apostle says, <q>and their thoughts accusing or excusing, in the revelation of the just judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180142"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;2:15-16</a></span> </p>

<p>14. <q>According to the multitude of their ungodlinesses drive them out:</q> that is, drive them out far away. For this is <q>according to the multitude of their ungodlinesses,</q>  that they should be driven out far away. The ungodly then are driven out from that inheritance, which is possessed by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> and seeing God: as diseased eyes are driven out from the shining of the light, when what is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> to others is pain to them. Therefore these shall not stand in the morning,  and see. And that expression is as great a punishment, as that which is said, <q>But for me it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to cleave to the Lord,</q>  is a great reward. To this punishment is opposed, <q>Enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of Your Lord;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180146"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;25:21</a></span> for similar to this expulsion is, <q>Cast him into outer darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180147"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;25:30</a></span> </p>

<p>15. <q>Since they have embittered You, O Lord: I am,</q> says He, <q>the Bread which came down from heaven;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180148"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span> again, <q>Labour for the meat which wasts not;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180149"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;6:27</a></span> again, <q>Taste and see that the Lord is sweet.</q>  But to sinners the bread of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is bitter. Whence they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the mouth of him that speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. These then have embittered <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> have fallen into such a state of sickliness, that the food of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in which healthy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> delight, as if it were bitter as gall, they cannot bear.</p>

<p>16. <q>And let all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that hope in You;</q> those of course to whose taste the Lord is sweet. <q>They will exult for evermore, and You will dwell in them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse11">Psalm 5:11</a></span>. This will be the exultation for evermore, when the just become the Temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He, their Indweller, will be their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. <q>And all that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Your name shall <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in You:</q> as when what they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is present for them to enjoy. And well is it said, <q>in You,</q> as if in possession of the inheritance, of which the title of the Psalm speaks: when they too are His inheritance, which is intimated by, <q>You will dwell in them.</q> From which good they are kept back, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the multitude of their ungodlinesses, drives out.</p>

<p>17. <q>For You will bless the just man</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa005.htm#verse12">Psalm 5:12</a></span>. This is blessing, to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to be inhabited by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Such sanctification is given to the just. But that they may be justified, a calling goes before: which is not of merit, but of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and want the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180151"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;3:23</a></span> <q>For whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180152"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse30">Romans&nbsp;8:30</a></span> Since then calling is not of our merit, but of the goodness and mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he went on to say, <q>O Lord, as with the shield of Your good will You have crowned us.</q> For God's good will goes before our good will, to call sinners to repentance. And these are the arms whereby the enemy is overcome, against whom it is said, <q>Who will bring accusation against God's elect?</q> Again, <q>if God be for us, who can be against us? Who spared not His Only Son, but delivered Him up for us all.</q>  <q>For if, when we were enemies, Christ died for us; much more being reconciled shall we be saved from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> through Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180154"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;5:10</a></span> This is that unconquerable shield, whereby the enemy is driven back, when he suggests despair of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through the multitude of tribulations and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>.</p>

<p>18. The whole contents of the Psalm, then, are a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that she may be heard, from the words, <q>hear my words, O Lord,</q> unto, <q>my King, and my God.</q> Then follows a view of those things which hinder the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that she  is heard, from the words, <q>because I shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto You, O Lord, in the morning You will hear my voice,</q> unto, <q>the man of blood and the crafty man the Lord will abominate.</q> Thirdly, she hopes that she, who is to be the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even now begins to draw near to Him in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, before that perfection which casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, from the words, <q>but I in the multitude of Your mercy,</q> unto, <q>I will worship at Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple in Your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> Fourthly, as she is progressing and advancing among those very things which she feels to hinder her, she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that she may be assisted within, where no man sees, lest she be turned aside by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> tongues, for the words, <q>O Lord, lead me forth in Your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> because of my enemies,</q> unto, <q>with their tongues they dealt craftily.</q> Fifthly, is a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of what punishment awaits the ungodly, when the just man shall scarcely be saved; and of what reward the just shall obtain, who, when they were called, came, and bore all things manfully, till they were brought to the end, from the words, <q>judge them, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> unto the end of the Psalm.</p>
