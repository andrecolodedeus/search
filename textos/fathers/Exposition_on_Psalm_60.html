<h1>Exposition on Psalm 60</h1>


<p>1. David the king was one man, but not one man he figured; sometimes to wit he figured the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of many men consisting, extended even unto the ends of the earth: but sometimes One Man he figured, Him he figured that is Mediator of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and men, the Man Christ Jesus. <span class="stiki" id="note182282"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:5</a></span> In this Psalm therefore, or rather in this Psalm's title, certain victorious actions of David are spoken of:...<q>To the end, in behalf of those men that shall be changed unto the title's inscription, unto teaching for David himself, when he burned up Mesopotamia in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> Sobal, and turned Joab, and smote Edom, in the valley of salt-pits twelve thousand.</q> We read of these things in the books of the Reigns,  that all those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom he has named, were defeated by David, that is, Mesopotamia in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> Sobal, Joab,  Edom. These things were done, and just as they were done, so there they have been written, so they are read: let him read that will. Nevertheless, as the Prophetic Spirit in the Psalms' titles is wont to depart somewhat from the expression of things done, and to say something which in history is not found, and hence rather to admonish us that titles of this kind have been written not that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things done, but that things future may be prefigured....But here this thing is inserted for this special reason, that there it is not written  that he burned up Mesopotamia in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> Sobal. But now let us begin to examine these things after the significations of things future, and to bring out the dimness of shadows into the light of the word.</p>

<p>2. What is <q>to the end</q> ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For <q>the end of the law is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q>  Those that are changed ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For who but they that do pass from old life into new?...<q>For you were sometime darkness, but now light in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182287"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> But they are changed <q>into the title's inscription,</q>...who into the kingdom of Christ do pass over from the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. It is well that they are changed unto this title's inscription. But they are changed, as follows, <q>unto teaching.</q> He added, <q>for David himself unto teaching:</q> that is, are changed not for themselves, but for David himself, and are changed unto teaching....When therefore would Christ have changed us, unless He had done that which He spoke of, <q>Fire I have come to send into the world</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note182288"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> If therefore Christ came to send into the world fire, to wit to its health and profit, we must inquire not how He is to send the world into fire, but how into the world fire. Inasmuch as therefore He came to send fire into the world, let us inquire what is Mesopotamia which was burned up, what is <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> Sobal? The interpretations therefore of the names let us examine according to the Hebrew language, wherein first this Scripture was written. Mesopotamia  they say is interpreted, <q>exalted calling.</q> Now the whole world by calling has been exalted, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>  is interpreted <q>lofty.</q> But she which was lofty, burned up has been and humbled. Sobal is interpreted <q>empty antiquity.</q> Thanks to Christ that has burned her. Whenever old bushes are burned up, green places succeed; and more speedily and more plentifully, and more fully green, fresh ones spring out, when fire has gone before them to the burning up of the old. Let not therefore the fire of Christ be feared, hay it consumes. <q>For all flesh is hay, and all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of man as flower of hay.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182291"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;40:6</a></span> He burns up therefore those things with that fire. <q>And turned Joab.</q> Joab is interpreted enemy. There was turned an enemy, as you will understand it. If turned unto flight, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> it is: if <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">converted</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> it is. How unto flight? From the heart of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>: <q>The Prince of this world,</q> He says, <q>now has been cast out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182292"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;12:31</a></span> But how can a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> turned to the Lord be an enemy turned? Because he has become a believer that had been an enemy. <q>Smote Edom.</q> Edom is interpreted <q>earthly.</q> That earthly one ought to be smitten. For why should one live earthly, that ought to live heavenly? There has been slain therefore life earthly, let there live life heavenly. <q>For as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of Him that is from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182293"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse49">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:49</a></span> See it slain: <q>Mortify your members which are upon earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182294"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> But when he had smitten Edom, he smote <q>twelve thousand in the valley of salt-pits.</q> Twelve thousand is a perfect number, to which perfect number also the number of the twelve Apostles is ascribed: for not to no purpose is it, but because through the whole world was to be sent the Word. But the Word <span class="stiki" id="note182295"><a href="../bible/eze037.htm#verse9">Ezekiel&nbsp;37:9</a></span> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is Christ, is in clouds, that is, in the preachers of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But the world of four parts does consist. The four parts thereof are exceeding well known to all, and often in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> they are mentioned: they are the same as the name of the four winds, East, West, North, and South. To all these four parts was sent the Word, so that in the Trinity all might be called. The number twelve four times three do make. With reason therefore twelve thousand  earthly things were smitten, the whole world was smitten: for from the whole world was chosen out the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, mortified from earthly life. Why <q>in the valley of salt-pits</q>? A valley is humility: salt-pits signify savour. For many men are humbled, but emptily and foolishly, in empty oldness they are humbled. One suffers tribulation for money, suffers tribulation for temporal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, suffers tribulation for the comforts of this life; he is to suffer tribulation and to be humbled: why not for the sake of God? Why not for the sake of Christ? Why not for the savour of <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that to you has been said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of earth,</q> and, <q>If the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> shall have been spoiled, for no other thing will it be of use, but to be cast out</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note182297"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;5:13</a></span> A good thing it is therefore wisely to be humbled. Behold now are not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> being humbled? Have not <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> been made even by men to condemn them, against whom divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> do reign, which even before had condemned them? Behold they are humbled, behold they are put to flight, behold <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> they suffer, but without savour; for folly, for emptiness. For now the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> has been spoiled: therefore it has been cast out, to be trodden down of men. We have heard the title of the Psalm, let us hear also the words of the Psalm.</p>

<p>3. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You have driven us back, and hast destroyed us</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse1">Psalm 59:1</a></span>. Is that David speaking that smote, that burned up, that defeated, and not they to whom He did these things, that is to say, their being smitten and driven back, that were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, and again their being made alive and returning in order that they might be good men? That destruction indeed that David made, strong of hand, our Christ, whose figure that man was bearing; He did those things, He made this destruction with His sword and with His fire: for both He brought into this world. Both <q>Fire I have come to send into the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182298"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> you have in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: and <q>A sword I have come to send into the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182299"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> you have in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. He brought in fire, whereby might be burned up Mesopotamia in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> Sobal: He brought in a sword whereby might be smitten Edom. Now again this destruction was made for the sake of <q>those that are changed unto the title's inscription.</q> Hear we therefore the voice of them: to their health smitten they were, being raised up let them speak. Let them say, therefore, that are changed into something better, changed unto the title's inscription, changed unto teaching for David himself; let them say, <q>You have had mercy upon us.</q> You have destroyed us, in order that You might build us; You have destroyed us that were ill built, hast destroyed empty oldness; in order that there may be a building unto a new man, building to abide for everlasting....</p>

<p>4. <q>You have moved the earth, and hast troubled it</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse2">Psalm 59:2</a></span>. How has the earth been troubled? In the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of sinners. Whither go we? Whither flee we, when this sword has been brandished, <q>Repent, for near has drawn the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note182300"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;3:2</a></span> <q>Heal the crushings  thereof, for moved it has been.</q> Unworthy it is to be healed, if moved it has not been: but you speak, preachest, threatenest us with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of coming judgment holdest not your peace, of the commandment of God you warn, from these things you abstain not; and he that hears, if he fears not, if he is not moved, is not worthy to be healed. Another hears, is moved, is stung, smites the breast, sheds tears....</p>

<p>5. The first labour is, that you should be displeasing to yourself, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you should battle out, that you should be changed into something better: the second labour, in return for your having been changed, is to bear the tribulations and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of this world, and amid them to hold on even unto the end. Of these things therefore when he was speaking, while pointing out such things, he adds what? <q>You have shown to Your people hard things</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse3">Psalm 59:3</a></span>: to Your people now, made tributary after the victory of David. <q>You have shown to Your people hard things.</q> Wherein? In <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has endured, when so much blood of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was spilled. <q>You have given us to drink of the wine of goading.</q> <q>Of goading</q> is what? Not of killing. For it was not a killing that destroys, but a medicine that smarts.  <q>You have given us to drink of the wine of goading.</q></p>

<p>6. Wherefore this? <q>You have given to men fearing You, a sign that they should flee from the face of the bow</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse4">Psalm 59:4</a></span>. Through tribulations temporal, he says, You have signified to Your own to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">fire everlasting</a>. For, says the Apostle Peter, <q>Time it is that Judgment begin with the House of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182303"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:17</a></span> And exhorting the Martyrs to endurance, when the world should rage, when slaughters should be made at the hands of persecutors, when far and wide blood of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> should be spilled, when in chains, in prisons, in tortures, many hard things <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> should suffer, in these hard things, I say, lest they should faint, Peter says to them, <q>Time it is that Judgment begin with the House of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> etc.  What therefore is to be in the Judgment? The bow is bended, still in menacing posture it is, not yet in aiming. And see what there is in the bow: is there not an arrow to be shot forward? The string however is stretched back in a contrary direction to that in which it is going to be shot; and the more the stretching thereof has gone backward, with the greater swiftness it starts forward. What is it that I have said? The more the Judgment is deferred, with so much the greater swiftness it is to come. Therefore even for temporal tribulations to God let us render thanks, because He has given to His people a sign, <q>that they should flee from the face of the bow:</q> in order that His faithful ones having been exercised in tribulations temporal, may be worthy to avoid the condemnation of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">fire everlasting</a>, which is to find out all them that do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these things.</p>

<p>7. <q>That Your beloved may be delivered: save me with Your right hand, and hearken unto me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse5">Psalm 59:5</a></span>. With Your right hand save me, Lord: so save me as that at the right hand I may stand. Not any safety temporal I require, in this matter Your Will be done. For a time what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for us we are utterly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>: for <q>what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182305"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;8:26</a></span> but <q>save me with Your right hand,</q> so that even if in this time I suffer sundry tribulations, when the night of all tribulations has been spent, on the right hand I may be found among the sheep, not on the left hand among the goats. <span class="stiki" id="note182306"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;25:33</a></span> <q>And hearken unto me.</q> Because now I am deserving that which You are willing to give; not <q>with the words of my transgressions</q> I am crying through the day, so that Thou hearken not, and <q>in the night so that Thou hearken not,</q>  and that not for folly to me, but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> for my warning, by adding savour from the valley of salt-pits, so that in tribulation I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what to ask: but I ask life everlasting; therefore hearken unto me, because Your right hand I ask....</p>

<p>8. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has spoken in His Holy One</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse6">Psalm 59:6</a></span>....In what Holy One of His? <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182308"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:19</a></span> In that Holy One, of whom elsewhere you have heard, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the Holy One is Your way.</q>  <q>I will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and will divide Sichima....and the valley of tabernacles I will measure out.</q> Sichima is interpreted shoulders. But according to history, Jacob returning from Laban his father-in-law with all his kindred, hid the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> in Sichima <span class="stiki" id="note182310"><a href="../bible/gen035.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;35:4</a></span> which he had from <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, where for a long time he had dwelled, and at length was coming from thence. But tabernacles he made there because of his sheep and herds, and called the place Tabernacles.  And these I will divide, says the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. What is this, <q>I will divide Sichima</q>? If to the story where the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were hidden is the reference, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> it signifies; I divide the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. I divide, is what? <q>For not in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is there <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182312"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> I divide, is what? Some will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, others will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>....The shoulders are divided, in order that their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may burden some men, while others may take up the burden of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For godly shoulders He was requiring when He said, <q>For My yoke is gentle, and My burden is light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182313"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;11:30</a></span> Another burden oppresses and loads you, but Christ's burden relieves you: another burden has weight, Christ's burden has wings. For even if you pull off the wings from a bird, you remove a kind of weight; and the more weight you have taken away, the more on earth it will abide. She that you have chosen to disburden lies there: she flies not, because you have taken off a weight: let there be given back the weight, and she flies. Such is Christ's burden; let men carry it, and not be idle: let them not be heeded that will not bear it; let them bear it that will, and they shall find how light it is, how sweet, how pleasant, how ravishing unto <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and from earth how transporting....Perchance because of the sheep of Jacob, <q>the valley of Tabernacles</q> is to be understood of the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the same is divided: for they have passed from thence that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, the rest have remained without.</p>

<p>9. <q>Mine is Galaad</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse7">Psalm 59:7</a></span>. These names are read in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Galaad has the voice of an interpretation of its own and of a great Mystery: for it is interpreted <q>the heap of testimony.</q> How great a heap of testimony in the Martyrs? <q>Mine is Galaad,</q> mine is a heap of testimony, mine are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Martyrs....Then  meanly esteemed was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, then reproach on Her a Widow was being thrown, because Christ's She was, because the sign of the Cross on her brow She was wearing: not yet was there <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, censure there was then: when therefore not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, but censure there was, then was made a heap of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; and through the heap of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> was the Love of Christ enlarged; and through the enlargement of the Love of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, were the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> possessed. There follows, <q>And mine is Manasses;</q> which is interpreted forgotten. For to Her had been said, <q>Confusion for everlasting You shall forget, and of the reproach of Your widowhood You shall not be mindful.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182314"><a href="../bible/isa054.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;54:4</a></span> There was therefore a confusion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> once, which now has been forgotten: for of Her confusion and of the <q>reproach</q> of Her widowhood now She is not mindful. For when there was a sort of confusion among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, a heap of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> was made. Now no longer does any even remember that confusion, when it was a reproach to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, now no one remembers, now all have forgotten, now <q>Mine is Manasses, and Ephraim the strength of My head.</q> Ephraim is interpreted fruitfulness. Mine, he says, is fruitfulness, and this fruitfulness is the strength of My Head. For My Head is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And whence is fruitfulness the strength of Him? Because unless a grain were to fall into the earth, it would not be multiplied, alone it would remain. <span class="stiki" id="note182315"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;12:24</a></span> Fall then to earth did Christ in His Passion, and there followed fruit-bearing in the Resurrection. He was hanging and was being despised: the grain was within, it had powers to draw after it all things. How in a grain do numbers of seeds lie hidden, something abject it appears to the eyes, but a power  turning into itself matter and bringing forth fruit is hidden; so in Christ's Cross <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>  was hidden, there appeared weakness. O mighty grain! Doubtless weak is He that hangs, Doubtless before Him that people did wag the head, Doubtless they said, <q>If <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> He is, let Him come down from the Cross.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182318"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;27:40</a></span> Hear the strength of Him: that which is a weak thing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is stronger than men. <span class="stiki" id="note182319"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:25</a></span> With reason so great fruitfulness has followed: it is mine, says the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>10. <q>Juda is my king: Moab the pot of my hope</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse7">Psalm 59:7</a></span>. What Juda? He that is of the tribe of Juda. What Juda, but He to whom Jacob himself said, <q>Juda, your brethren shall praise you</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note182320"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;49:8</a></span> What therefore should I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, when Juda my king says, <q>Fear not them that kill the body</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note182321"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;10:28</a></span> <q>Moab the pot of my hope.</q> Wherefore <q>pot</q>? Because tribulation. Wherefore <q>of my hope</q>? Because there has gone before Juda my king....Moab is perceived in the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For that nation was born of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note182322"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse37">Genesis&nbsp;19:37</a></span> that nation was born of the daughters of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, who lay with their father drunken, abusing a father. Better were it to have remained barren, than thus to have become mothers. But this was a kind of figure of them that abuse the law. For do not heed that law in the Latin language is of the feminine gender: in Greek of the masculine gender it is: but whether it be of the feminine gender in speaking, or of the masculine, the expression makes no difference to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For law has rather a masculine force, because it rules, is not ruled. But moreover, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says what? <q>Good is the law, if any one use it lawfully.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182323"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:8</a></span> But those daughters of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> unlawfully used their father. But in the same manner as good works begin to grow when a man uses well the law: so arise <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works, when a man ill uses the law. Furthermore, they ill using their father, that is, ill using the law, engendered the Moabites, by whom are signified <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works. Thence the tribulation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, thence the pot boiling up. Of this pot in a certain place of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is said, <q>A pot heated by the North wind.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182324"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:13</a></span> Whence but by the quarters of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who has said, <q>I will set my seat at the North</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note182325"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;14:13</a></span> The chiefest tribulations therefore arise against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from none except from those that ill use the law....</p>

<p>11. <q>Into Idum&aelig;a I will stretch out my shoe</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse8">Psalm 59:8</a></span>. The Church speaks, <q>I will come through even unto Idum&aelig;a.</q> Let tribulations rage, let the world boil with offenses, even unto those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that lead an earthly life (for Idum&aelig;a is interpreted earthly), even unto those same, <q>even unto Idum&aelig;a, I will stretch out my shoe.</q> Of what thing the shoe except of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? <q>How beautiful the feet of them that tell of peace, that tell of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182326"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;10:15</a></span> and <q>the feet shod unto the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182327"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse15">Ephesians&nbsp;6:15</a></span> ...In these times we see, brethren, how many earthly men do perpetrate frauds for the sake of gain, for frauds <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuries</a>; on account of their fears they consult fortune-tellers, astrologers: all these men are Edomites, earthly; and nevertheless all these men adore Christ, under His own shoe they are; now even unto Idum&aelig;a is stretched out His shoe. <q>To Me Allophyli have been made subject.</q> Who are <q>Allophyli</q>? Men of other race, not belonging to My race.  They <q>have been made subject,</q> because many men adore Christ, and are not to reign with Christ.</p>

<p>12. <q>Who will lead Me down into the city of standing round?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse9">Psalm 59:9</a></span>. What is the city of standing round? If you remember already, I have made mention thereof in another Psalm,  wherein has been said, <q>And they shall go around the city.</q> For the city of standing round is the compassing around of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which compassing around of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in the middle thereof had the one nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, worshipping one God: the rest of the compassing around of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> made supplication, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> they did serve. And <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> it was called the city of standing round; because on all sides the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> had poured themselves around, and had stood around that nation which did worship one God....<q>Who will lead me down even unto Idum&aelig;a?</q></p>

<p>13. <q>Wilt not Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that hast driven us back? And will not Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, march forth in our powers?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse10">Psalm 59:10</a></span>. Wilt not Thou lead us down, that hast driven us back? But wherefore <q>hast driven us back</q>? Because You have destroyed us.  Wherefore hast destroyed us? Because <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> You have been, and hast had pity on us. Thou therefore wilt lead down, that hast driven back; Thou, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that will not march forth in our powers, wilt lead down. What is, <q>will not march forth in our powers</q>? The world is to rage, the world is to tread us down, there is to be a heap of witnesses, built of the spilled blood of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and the raging <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are to say, <q>Where is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of them?</q>  Then <q>You will not march forth in our powers:</q> against them You will not show Yourself, You will not show Your power, such as You have shown in David, in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in Joshua the son of Nun, when to their might the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> yielded, and when the slaughter had been ended, and the great laying waste repaired, into the land which Thou promised Thou leddest in Your people. This thing then You will not do, <q>You will not march forth in our powers,</q> but within You will work. What is, <q>will not march forth</q>? Wilt not show Yourself. For indeed when in chains the Martyrs were being led along, when they were being shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, when they were being led forth to be mocked, when to the beasts they were exposed,  when they were being smitten with the sword, when with fire they were being burned, were they not despised as though forsaken, as though without helper? In what manner was God working within? In what manner within was He comforting? In what manner to these men was He making sweet the hope of life everlasting? In what manner was He not forsaking the hearts of them, where the man was dwelling  in silence, well if good, ill if <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Was He then by any means forsaking, because He was not marching forth in the powers  of them? By not marching forth in the powers of them, did He not the more lead down the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even unto Idum&aelig;a, lead down the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even unto the city of standing around? For if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> chose to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and to use the sword, She would seem to be fighting for life present: but because she was despising life present, therefore there was made a heap of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> for the life that shall be.</p>

<p>14. Thou therefore, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that will not march forth in our powers, <q>Give to us aid from tribulation, and vain is the safety of man</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse11">Psalm 59:11</a></span>. Go now they that <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> have not, and desire safety temporal for their friends, which is empty oldness. <q>Give to us aid:</q> from thence whence You were supposed to forsake, thence succour. <q>In God we will do valour,  and Himself to nothing shall bring down our enemies</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa059.htm#verse12">Psalm 59:12</a></span>. We will not do valour with the sword, not with horses, not with breastplates, not with shields, not in the mightiness of an army, not abroad. But where? Within, where we are not seen. Where within? <q>In God we will do <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>:</q> and as if abjects, and as if trodden down, men as if of no consideration we shall be, but <q>Himself to nothing shall bring down our enemies.</q> In a word, this thing has been done to our enemies. Trodden down have been the Martyrs: by suffering, by enduring, by persevering even unto the end, in God they have done valour. Himself also has done that which follows: to nothing He has brought down the enemies of them. Where are now the enemies of the Martyrs, except perchance that now drunken men with their cups do <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> those whom at that time frenzied men did use with stones to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>?</p>
