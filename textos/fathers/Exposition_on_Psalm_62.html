<h1>Exposition on Psalm 62</h1>


<p>1. The title of it is, <q>Unto the end, in behalf of Idithun, a Psalm to David himself.</q> I recollect that already  to you has been explained what Idithun is....Let us see how far he has leaped over, and whom he has <q>leaped over,</q> and in what place, though he has leaped over certain men, he is situate, whence as from a kind of spiritual and secure position he may behold what is below....He being set, I say, in a certain fortified place, does say, <q>Shall not my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be subject to God?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse1">Psalm 61:1</a></span>. For he had heard, <q>He that does exalt himself shall be humbled; and he that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself shall be exalted:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182360"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;23:12</a></span> and fearful lest by leaping over he should be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, not elated by those things which were below, but <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> because of Him that was above; to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> men, as it were threatening to him a fall, who were grieved that he had leaped over, he has made answer, <q>Shall not my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be subject to God?</q>...<q>For from Himself is my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> <q>For Himself is my God and my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, my taker up, I shall not be moved more</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse2">Psalm 61:2</a></span>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who is above me, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who stretches forth His mercy to men that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> under the coverings of whose wings I should hope: <q>I shall not be moved more.</q>...</p>

<p>2. Therefore, down from the higher place fortified and protected, he, to whom the Lord has been made a refuge, he, to whom is God Himself for a fortified place,  has regard to those whom he has leaped over, and looking down upon them speaks as though from a lofty tower: for this also has been said of Him, <q>A Tower of strength from the face of the enemy:</q>  he gives heed therefore to them, and says, <q>How long do ye lay upon a man?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse3">Psalm 61:3</a></span>. By insulting, by hurling reproaches, by laying wait, by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a>, you lay upon a man burthens, you lay upon a man as much as a man can bear:  but in order that a man may bear, under him is He that has made man. If to a man ye look, <q>slay ye, all of you.</q> Behold, lay upon, rage, <q>slay ye, all of you.</q> <q>As though a wall bowed down, and as a fence smitten against;</q> lean against, smite against, as if going to throw down. And where is, <q>I shall not be moved more</q>? But wherefore? <q>I shall not be moved more.</q> Because Himself is God my Saving One, my taker up, therefore ye men are able to lay burdens upon a man; can you anywise lay upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who protects man? <q>Slay ye, all of you.</q> What is that size of body in one man so great as that he may be slain by all? But we ought to perceive our person, the person of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the person of the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For one Man with His Head and Body is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Saviour of the Body and the Members of the Body: two in one Flesh,  and in one voice, and in one passion, and, when iniquity shall have passed over, in one rest. The sufferings therefore of Christ are not in Christ alone; nay, there are not any save in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if Christ you understand to be Head and Body, the sufferings of Christ are not, save in Christ: but if Christ thou understand of Head alone, the sufferings of Christ are not in Christ alone. For if the sufferings of Christ are in Christ alone, to wit in the Head alone; whence says a certain member of Him, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle, <q>In order that I may supply what are wanting of the oppressions of Christ in my flesh</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note182365"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse24">Colossians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> If therefore in the members of Christ you are, whatsoever man you are that art hearing these words, whosoever you are that dost hear these words (but however, you hear, if in the members of Christ you are): whatsoever thing you suffer from those that are not in the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, was wanting to the sufferings of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore it is added because it was wanting; you fill up the measure, you cause it not to run over: you suffer so much as was to be contributed out of your sufferings to the whole suffering of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that has suffered in our Head, and does suffer in His members, that is, in our own selves. Unto this our common republic, as it were each of us according to our measure pays that which we owe, and according to the powers which we have, as it were a quota  of sufferings we contribute. The storehouse  of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> sufferings will not be completely made up, save when the world shall have been ended....That whole City therefore is speaking, from the blood of righteous Abel even to the blood of Zacharias. <span class="stiki" id="note182368"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;23:35</a></span> Thence also hereafter from the blood of John, through the blood of the Apostles, through the blood of Martyrs, through the blood of the faithful ones of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, one City speaks, one man says, <q>How long do ye lay upon a man? Slay ye, all of you.</q> Let us see if you efface, let us see if you extinguish, let us see if you remove from the earth the name thereof, let us see if you peoples do not meditate of empty things,  saying, <q>When shall She die, and when shall perish the name of Her?</q>  <q>As though She were a wall bowed down, and a fence smitten against,</q>  lean ye against Her, smite against Her. Hear from above:  <q>My taker up, I shall not be moved more:</q> for as though a heap of sand I have been smitten against that I might fall, and the Lord has taken me up.</p>

<p>3. <q>Nevertheless, mine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> they have thought to drive back</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse4">Psalm 61:4</a></span>. Conquered while they slay men yielding, by the blood of the slain multiplying the faithful, yielding to these and no longer being able to kill; <q>Nevertheless, mine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> they have thought to drive back.</q> Now because a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cannot be killed, pains are taken that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> should be dishonoured. For now by the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the hearts of ungodly men are tortured: now that spiritual Joseph, after his selling by his brethren, after his removal from his home into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> as though into the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, after the humiliation of a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>,  after the made-up tale of a false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, after that there had come to pass that which of him was said, <q>Iron passed through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of him:</q>  now he is honoured, now he is not made subject to brethren selling him, but grain he supplies to them hungering. <span class="stiki" id="note182375"><a href="../bible/gen042.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;42:5</a></span> Conquered by his humility and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, uncorruptness, <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, sufferings, now honoured they see him, and his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> they think to check....Is it all against one man, or one man against all; or all against all, or one against one? Meanwhile, when he says, <q>ye lay upon a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> it is as it were upon one man: and when he says, <q>Slay all you,</q> it is as if all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were against one man: but nevertheless it is also all against all, because also all are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but in One. But why must those various <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> hostile to Christ be spoken of as all together? Are they also one? Truly them also as one I dare to speak of: because there is one City and one city, one People and one people, King and king. One City and one city is what? <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> one, Jerusalem one. By whatsoever other mystical names besides She is called, yet One City there is and one city; over this the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is king, over that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is King....</p>

<p>4. Give heed, brethren, give heed, I entreat you. For it delights me yet to speak a few words to you of this beloved City. For <q>most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> things of You have been spoken, City of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And, <q>if I forget You, O Jerusalem, let my own right hand forget me.</q>  For dear is the one Country, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> but one Country, the only Country: besides Her whatsoever we have, is a sojourning in a strange land. I will say therefore that which you may acknowledge, that of which you may approve: I will call to your minds that which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I will not teach that which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. <q>Not first,</q> says the Apostle, <q>that which is spiritual, but that which is natural,  afterwards that which is spiritual.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182379"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:46</a></span> Therefore the former city is greater by age, because first was born Cain, and afterwards Abel: <span class="stiki" id="note182380"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;4:1-2</a></span> but in these the elder shall serve the younger. <span class="stiki" id="note182381"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;25:23</a></span> The former greater by age, the latter greater in dignity. Wherefore is the former greater by age? Because <q>not first that which is spiritual, but that which is natural.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182382"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:46</a></span> Wherefore is the latter greater in dignity? Because <q>the elder shall serve the younger.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182383"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;25:23</a></span> ...Cain first built a city, and in that place he built where no city was. But when Jerusalem was being built, it was not built in a place where there was not a city, but there was a city at first which was called Jebus, whence the Jebusites. This having been captured, overcome, made subject, there was built a new city, as though the old were thrown down; and it was called Jerusalem, <span class="stiki" id="note182384"><a href="../bible/jos018.htm#verse28">Joshua&nbsp;18:28</a></span> vision of peace, City of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Each one therefore that is born of Adam, not yet does belong to Jerusalem: for he bears with him the offshoot  of iniquity, and the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, having been consigned to death, and he belongs in a manner to a sort of old city. But if he is to be in the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; his old self will be thrown down, and he will be built up new. For this reason therefore Cain built a city where there was not a city. For from mortality and from naughtiness every one sets out, in order that he may be made good hereafter. <q>For as by the disobedience of one man many were made sinners, so by the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of One Man many shall be made just.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182386"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;5:19</a></span> And all we in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> do die: <span class="stiki" id="note182387"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22</a></span> and each one of us of <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was born. Let him pass over to Jerusalem, he shall be thrown down old, and shall be built new. As though to conquered Jebusites, in order that there may be built up Jerusalem, is said, <q>Put ye off the old man, and put on the new.</q>  And now to them built in Jerusalem, and shining by the light of Grace, is said, <q>You have been sometime darkness, but now light in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182389"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> city therefore from the beginning even unto the end does run on, and the good City by the changing of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men is built up. And these two cities are meanwhile mingled, at the end to be severed; against each other mutually in conflict, the one for iniquity, the other for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And sometimes this very temporal mingling brings it to pass that certain men belonging to the city <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, do order matters belonging to Jerusalem, and again certain men belonging to Jerusalem, do order matters belonging to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. Something difficult I seem to have propounded. Be patient, until it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by examples. <q>For all things</q> in the old people, as writes the Apostle, <q>in a figure used to befall them: but they have been written for our amendment, upon whom the end of the world has come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182390"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:11</a></span> Regard therefore that people as also set to intimate an after people; and see then what I say. There were great  kings in Jerusalem: it is a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> fact, they are enumerated, are named. They all were, I say, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> citizens of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and they were ordering matters of Jerusalem: all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from thence to be dissevered at the end, to no one but to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> do belong. Again we find citizens of Jerusalem to have ordered certain matters belonging to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. For those three children, Nabuchodonosor, overcome by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, made the ministers of his kingdom, and set them over his Satraps; and so there were ordering the matters of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> citizens of Jerusalem.  Observe now how this is being fulfilled and done in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and in these times....Every earthly commonwealth, sometime assuredly to perish, whereof the kingdom is to pass away, when there shall come that kingdom, whereof we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <q>Your kingdom come;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182393"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;6:10</a></span> and whereof has been foretold, <q>And of His kingdom shall be no end:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182394"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;1:33</a></span> an earthly commonwealth, I say, has our citizens conducting the affairs of it. For how many faithful, how many good men, are both magistrates in their cities, and are judges, and are generals, and are counts, and are kings? All that are just and good men, having not anything in heart but the most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> things, which of You have been said, City of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  And as if they were doing bond-service  in the city which is to pass away, even there by the doctors of the Holy City they are bidden to keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with those set over them, <q>whether with the king as supreme, or with governors as though sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, but for the praise of good men: </q> <span class="stiki" id="note182397"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:13-14</a></span> or as servants, that to their masters they should be subject, <span class="stiki" id="note182398"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;6:5</a></span> even <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to Heathens, and the better should keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with the worse, for a time to serve, for everlasting to have dominion. For these things do happen until iniquity do pass away.  Servants are commanded to bear with masters <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and capricious: the citizens of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> are commanded to be endured by the citizens of Jerusalem, showing even more attentions, than if they were citizens of the same <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, as though fulfilling the precept, <q>He that shall have exacted of you a mile, go with him other two.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182400"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;5:41</a></span> ...</p>

<p>5. <q>I have run in thirst.</q>  For they were rendering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things:  for them was I thirsting: mine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> they thought to drive back: I was thirsting to bring them over into my body. For in drinking what do we, but send into our members liquor that is without, and suck it into our body? Thus did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in that head of the calf. <span class="stiki" id="note182403"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;32:10</a></span> The head of the calf is a great sacrament.  For the head of the calf was the body of ungodly men, in the similitude of a calf eating hay,  seeking earthly things: because all flesh is hay. <span class="stiki" id="note182406"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;40:6</a></span> ...And what now is more evident, than that into that City Jerusalem, of which the people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was a type, by Baptism men were to be made to pass over? Therefore in water it was scattered, in order that for drink it might be given. For this even unto the end this man thirsts; he runs and thirsts. For many men He drinks, but never will He be without thirst. For thence is, <q>I thirst, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, give Me to drink.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182407"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;4:7</a></span> That <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> at the well found the Lord thirsting, and by Him thirsting she was filled: she first found Him thirsting, in order that He might drink her believing. And when He was on the Cross, <q>I thirst,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182408"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;19:28</a></span> He said, although they gave not to Him that for which He was thirsting. For for themselves He was thirsting: but they gave vinegar, not new wine, wherewith are filled up the new bottles, but old wine, but old to its loss. <span class="stiki" id="note182409"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;9:17</a></span> For old vinegar also is said of the old men, of whom has been said, <q>For to them is no changing;</q>  namely, that the Jebusites should be overthrown, and Jerusalem be built. <span class="stiki" id="note182411"><a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;5:9</a></span> </p>

<p>6. So also the Head of this body even unto the end from the beginning runs in thirst. And as if to Him were being said, Why in thirst? What is wanting to You, O Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, O <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>? In so great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, in so great exaltation, in so great height also even in this world established, what is wanting to You? There is fulfilled that which has been foretold of you, <q>There shall adore Him all kings of the earth, all nations shall serve Him.</q>. ..They that at Jerusalem's festivals fill up the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, at <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon's</a> festivals fill up the theatres: and for all they serve, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Her&mdash; not only those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that bear the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the commandments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but also they, that bear not even the mere <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a>, Heathen though they be, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> though they be&mdash;they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, praise, proclaim, <q>but with their mouths they were blessing.</q> I heed not the mouth, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that has instructed me, <q>with their heart they were cursing.</q> In that place they were cursing, where <q>mine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> they thought to drive back.</q></p>

<p>7. What are You doing, O Idithun, Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, leaping over them? What are You doing amid all these things? What will You do? Will you faint? Will You not persevere even unto the end? Will You not hearken, <q>He that shall have persevered even unto the end, the same shall be saved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182413"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;10:22</a></span> though for that iniquity abounds, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many shall wax cold? <span class="stiki" id="note182414"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12</a></span> And where is it that You have leaped over them?

In a necklace it will glitter, in an ornament it will glitter: let it suffer however the furnace, in order that being cleansed from dross it may come into light. This is the furnace, there is there chaff, there gold, there fire, into this blows the refiner: in the furnace burns the chaff, and the gold is cleansed; the one into ashes is turned, of dross the other is cleansed. The furnace is the world, the chaff unrighteous men, the gold just men; the fire tribulation, the refiner God: that which therefore the refiner wills I do; wherever the Maker sets me I endure it. I am commanded to endure, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to cleanse. Though there burn the chaff to set me on fire, and as if to consume me; that into ashes is burned, I of dross am cleansed. Wherefore? Because <q>to God my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be made subject: for from Himself is my patience.</q></p>

<p>8. <q>For Himself is my God and My Saving One, my Taker up, I will not remove hence</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse6">Psalm 61:6</a></span>. Because <q>Himself is my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> therefore He calls me: <q>and my Saving One,</q> therefore He justifies me: <q>and my Taker up,</q> therefore He <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorifies</a> me.

Therefore from my lodging I shall remove, from my Heavenly home I shall not remove. <q>In God is my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse7">Psalm 61:7</a></span>. Saved I shall be in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> I shall be in God: for not only saved, but also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, saved, because a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man I have been made out of an ungodly man, by Him justified; <span class="stiki" id="note182418"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;4:2</a></span> but <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, because not only justified, but also honoured. For <q>those whom He has <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a>, those also He has called.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182419"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse30">Romans&nbsp;8:30</a></span> Calling them, what has He done here? <q>Whom He has called, the same also He has justified; but whom He has justified, the same also He has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> Justification therefore to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> belongs, glorifying to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. How glorifying to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> belongs, it is not needful to discuss. How justification belongs to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, let us seek some <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. Behold there comes to mind out of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: there were some who to themselves were seeming to be just men, and they were finding fault with the Lord because He admitted to the feast sinners, and with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners was eating; to such men therefore priding themselves, strong men of earth very much lifted up, much glorying of their own soundness, such as they counted it, not such as they had, the Lord answered what? <q>They that are whole need not a Physician, but they that are sick.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182420"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;9:13</a></span> Whom calls He whole, whom calls He sick? He continues and says, <q>I have not come to call just men, but sinners unto repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182421"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12</a></span> He has called therefore <q>the whole</q> just men, not because the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> were so, but because themselves they thought so to be; and for this reason were <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and grudged sick men a physician, and being more sick than those, they slew the Physician. He has called whole, however, righteous men, sick, the sinners. My being justified therefore, says that man that leaps over, from Himself I have: my being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, from Himself I have: <q>For God is my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <q>My <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,</q> so that saved I am: <q>my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> so that honoured I am.

<p>9. <q>Hope ye in Him all the council of the people</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse8">Psalm 61:8</a></span>. Imitate ye Idithun, leap over your enemies; men fighting against you, stopping up your way, men hating you, leap ye over: <q>Hope in Him all the council of the people: pour out before Him your hearts:</q>...By imploring, by confessing, by hoping.

Certainly many men there are: behold there is that one man, that one man that was cast forth from the multitude of guests. <span class="stiki" id="note182426"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;22:11</a></span> They conspire, they all seek things temporal, and they that are carnal things carnal, and for the future they hope them, whosoever do hope: even if because of variety of opinions they are in division, nevertheless because of vanity they are at one. Divers indeed are <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and of many forms, and the kingdom against itself divided shall not stand: <span class="stiki" id="note182427"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;12:25</a></span> but alike in all is the will vain and lying, belonging to one king, with whom into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">fire everlasting</a> it is to be thrown headlong <span class="stiki" id="note182428"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> &mdash; <q>these men because of vanity are at one.</q> And for them see how He thirsts, see how He runs in thirst.</p>

<p>10. He turns therefore Himself to them, thirsting for them: <q>Do not hope in iniquity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse10">Psalm 61:10</a></span>. For my hope is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You that will not draw near and pass over, <q>do not hope in iniquity.</q> For I that have leapt over, my hope is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and is there anywise iniquity with God? <span class="stiki" id="note182429"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;9:14</a></span> This thing let us do, that thing let us do, of that thing let us think, thus let us adjust our lyings in wait; <q>Because of vanity being at one.</q>  You thirst: they that think of those things against you are given up by those whom you drink. <q>Do not hope in vanity.</q> Vain is iniquity, nought is iniquity, mighty is nothing save righteousness. Truth may be hidden for a time, conquered it cannot be. Iniquity may flourish for a time, abide it cannot. <q>Do not hope upon iniquity: and for <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> be not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>.</q> You are not rich, and will you rob? What do you find? What do you lose? O losing gains!  You           find              money, you lose righteousness. <q>For <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> be not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>.</q>...Therefore, vain sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, lying sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, neither rob, nor, if there flow riches, set heart upon them: no longer <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> vanity, and seek lying. For <q>blessed is the man who has the Lord God for his hope, and who has not had regard unto vanities, and lying follies.</q>  You would deceive, you would commit a fraud, what bring ye in order that you may cheat. Deceitful balances. For <q>lying,</q> he says, <q>are the sons of men in the balances,</q> in order that they may cheat by bringing forth deceitful balances. By a false balance ye beguile men looking on: <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye not that one is he that weighs, Another He that judges of the weight? He sees not, for whom you weigh, but He sees that weighs you and him. Therefore neither fraud nor <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> ye any longer, nor on those things which you have set your hope:  I have admonished, have foretold, says this Idithun.</p>

<p>11. What follows? <q>Once has God spoken, these two things I have heard, that power is of God <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse11">Psalm 61:11</a></span>, and to You, O Lord, is mercy, for You shall render to each one after his works</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse12">Psalm 61:12</a></span>....<q>Once has God spoken.</q> What do you say, Idithun? If you that had leapt over them art saying, <q>Once He has spoken;</q> I turn to another Scripture and it says to me, <q>In many quarters and in many ways formerly God has spoken to the fathers in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182432"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;1:1</a></span> What is, <q>Once has God spoken</q>? Is He not the God that in the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> spoke to Adam? <span class="stiki" id="note182433"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Did not the Selfsame speak to Cain, to Noe, to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to Isaac, to Jacob, to all the Prophets, and to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>?  One man <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was, and how often to him spoke God? Behold even to one man, not once but ofttimes God has spoken. Secondly, He has spoken to the Son when standing here, <q>You are My beloved Son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182435"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span> God has spoken to the Apostles, He has spoken to all the Saints, even though not with voice sounding through the cloud, nevertheless in the heart where He is Himself Teacher.  What is therefore, <q>Once has God spoken</q>? Much has that man leapt over in order to arrive at that place, where once God has spoken. Behold briefly I have spoken to your Love. Here among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, to men ofttimes, in many ways, in many quarters, through creatures of many forms God has spoken: by Himself once God has spoken, because One Word God has begotten....For it could not be but that God did Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which by the Word He made: <span class="stiki" id="note182437"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> but if that which He made He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, in Him there was that which was made before it was made. For if in Him was not that which was made before it was made, how <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> He that which He made? For you can not say that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made things He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not. God therefore has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that which He has made. And how <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> He before He made, if there cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> any but things made? But by things made there cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> any but things previously made, by you, to wit, who art a man made in a lower place, and set in a lower place: but before that all these things were made, they were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by Him by whom they were made, and that which He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> He made. Therefore in that Word by which He made all things, before that they were made, were all things; and after they have been made there are all things; but in one way here, in another there, in one way in their own nature wherein they have been made, in another in the art by which they have been made. Who could explain this? We may endeavour: go ye with Idithun, and see.</p>

<p>12. ...For even the Lord says, <q>Many things I have to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182438"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;16:12</a></span> What is therefore, <q>These two things I have heard</q>? These two things which to you I am about to say not of myself to you I say, but what things I have heard I say. <q>Once has God spoken:</q> One Word has He, the Only-begotten God. In that Word are all things, because by the Word were made all things. One Word has He, <q>in whom all the treasures of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> are hidden.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182439"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;2:3</a></span> One Word He has, <q>once has God spoken.</q> <q>These two things,</q> which to you I am about to say, these I have heard: not of myself I speak, not of myself I say: to this belongs the <q>I have heard.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182440"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;8:26</a></span> But the friend of the Bridegroom stands and hears Him, that he may speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For he hears Him, lest by speaking a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, of his own he should speak: <span class="stiki" id="note182441"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> lest you should say, Who are you that sayest this thing to me? Whence do you say this to me? I have heard these two things, and I that speak to you that I have heard these two things, am one who also does <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that once God has spoken. Do not despise a hearer saying to you certain two things for you so necessary; him, I say, that by leaping over the whole creation has attained unto the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, where he has learned that <q>once God has spoken.</q></p>

<p>13. Let him therefore now say certain two things. For greatly to us belong these two things. <q>For power is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to You, O Lord, is mercy.</q> Are these the two things, power and mercy? These two evidently: perceive ye the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, perceive ye the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In these two things are contained nearly all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. Because of these two things are the Prophets, because of these two, the Patriarchs, because of these the Law, because of these Himself <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, because of these the Apostles, because of these all the preaching and spreading of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because of these two, because of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His mercy. His power <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> ye, His mercy <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> ye. Neither so on His mercy rely, as that His power ye despise: nor so the power <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> ye, as that of mercy ye despair. With Him is power, with Him mercy. This man He <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a>, and that man He exalts:  this man He <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> with power, that man He exalts in mercy. <q>For if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, willing to show <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and to prove His power, has in much patience borne with the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, which have been perfected unto perdition</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182443"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse22">Romans&nbsp;9:22</a></span> &mdash; you have heard of power: inquire for mercy&mdash; <q>and that He might make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,</q> He says, <q>His riches unto the vessels of mercy.</q> It belongs therefore to His power to condemn <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> men. And to Him who would say, What have you done? <q>For you, O man, who are you that should make answer to God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182444"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;9:20</a></span> Fear therefore and tremble at His power: but hope for His mercy. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is a sort of power; ofttimes however he wishes to hurt, and is not able, because that power is under power. For if the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> could hurt as much as he would; no one of just men would remain, nor could any one of the faithful be on earth. The same through his vessels smites against, as it were, a wall bowed down: but he only smites against, so far as he receives power. But in order that the wall may not fall, the Lord will support: for He that gives power to the tempter, does Himself to the tempted extend mercy. For according to measure the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is permitted to tempt. And, <q>You will give us to drink in tears in a measure.</q>  Do not therefore <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the tempter permitted to do somewhat: for you have a most merciful Saviour. So much he is permitted to tempt as is profitable for you, that you may be exercised, may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>; in order that by yourself you may be found out, that <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> not yourself. For where, or from whence, ought we to be secure, except by this power and mercy of God? After that Apostolic saying, <q>Faithful is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that does not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182446"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> ...Fear not the enemy: so much he does as he has received power to do, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him that has the chief power: <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, that does as much as He wills, and who does nothing <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, and whatever He shall have done, is just. We might suppose something or other to be <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>: inasmuch as God has done it, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it to be just.</p>

<p>14. Therefore, you say, if any one slay an innocent man, does he <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>? Unjustly certainly. Wherefore does God permit this?...The counsel of God to tell to you, O man, I am not able: this thing however I say, both that the man has done <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> that has slain an innocent person, and that it would not have been done unless God permitted it: and though the man has done <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, yet God has not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> permitted this. Let the reason lie concealed in that person whoever it be, for whose sake you are moved, whose innocence does much move you. For to you speedily I might make answer. He would not have been slain unless he were guilty: but you think him innocent. I might speedily say this to you. For you could not examine his heart, sift his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, weigh his thoughts, so that you could say to me, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> he was slain. I might easily therefore make answer: but there is forced upon my view a certain Just One, without dispute just, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> just, who had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, slain by sinners, betrayed by a sinner; Himself Christ the Lord, of whom we cannot say that He has any iniquity, for <q>those things which He <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> not He paid,</q>  is made an objection to my answer. And why should I speak of Christ? <q>With you I am dealing,</q> you say. And I with you. About Him you propose a question, about Him I am solving the question. For therein the counsel of God we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, which except by His own revealing we should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: so that when you shall have found out that counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby He has permitted His innocent Son to be slain by <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> men, and such a counsel as pleases you, and such a counsel as cannot displease you, if you are just, you may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in other things also by His counsel God does the same, but it escaped you. Ah! Brethren, need there was of the blood of a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> one to blot out the handwriting of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; need there was of an example of patience, of an example of humility; need there was of the Sign of the Cross to beat down the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; need for us there was of the Passion of our Lord; for by the Passion of the Lord redeemed has been the world. How many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things has the Passion of the Lord done! And yet the Passion of this Just One would not have been, unless unrighteous men had slain the Lord. What then? Is this good thing which to us has been granted by the Lord's Passion to be ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> slayers of Christ? Far be it. They willed, God permitted. They guilty would have been, even if only they had willed it: but God would not have permitted it, unless just it had been....Accordingly, my brethren, both Judas the foul traitor to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the persecutors of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, malignant all, ungodly all, <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> all, are to be condemned all: and nevertheless the Father His own proper Son has not spared, but for the sake of us all He has delivered Him up. <span class="stiki" id="note182448"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> Order if you are able; distinguish if you are able (these things): render to God your vows, which your lips have uttered: see what the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> has here done, what the Just One. The one has willed, the Other has permitted: the one <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> has willed, the Other <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> has permitted. Let <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> will be condemned, just permission be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. For what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing has befallen Christ, in that Christ has died? Both <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> were they that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> willed to do, and yet nothing of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> did He suffer on whom they did it. Slain was mortal flesh, slaying death by death, giving a lesson of patience, sending before an example of Resurrection. How great <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the Just One were wrought by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>! This is the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of God: that even a good thing which you do He has Himself given it to you, and by your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> He does good Himself. Do not therefore wonder, God permits, and in judgment permits: He permits, and in measure, number, weight, He permits. With Him is not iniquity: <span class="stiki" id="note182450"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;9:14</a></span> do thou only belong to Him; on Himself set your hope, let Himself be your Helper, your Salvation: in Him be there the fortified place, the tower of strength,  your refuge let Himself be, and He will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able to bear, but will make with the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> also an escape, that you may be able to support it: <span class="stiki" id="note182452"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> so that His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> you to bear <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, be His power; His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> not any more on you to be done than you are able to bear, be His mercy: <q>for power is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to You, O Lord, is mercy, because You will render to each one after his works.</q></p>

<p>15. That thirst of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, would fain drink up that man also whom you see.  At the same time also, in order that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many in the mixed multitude of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> with their mouth do bless, and in their heart curse, this man having been a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and a believer returns as a penitent, and being terrified by the power of the Lord, turns him to the mercy of the Lord. For having been led astray by the enemy when he was a believer, long time he has been an astrologer, led astray, leading astray, deceived, deceiving, he has allured, has beguiled, many lies he has spoken against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, That has given to men power of doing that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and of not doing that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. He used to say, that one's own will did not <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, but Venus; one's own will did not manslaying, but Mars; and God did not what is just, but Jupiter; and many other <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> things, and not light ones. From how many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> do ye think he has pocketed money? How many from him have bought a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, to whom we used to say, <q>Sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, how long are you dull of heart, wherefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> ye vanity, and seek a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a></q>?  Now, as of him must be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, he has shuddered at his lie, and being the allurer of many men, he has perceived at length that by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> he has himself been allured, and he turns to God a penitent. We think, brethren, that because of great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of heart it has come to pass. For what must we say? If out of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> an astrologer were converted, great indeed would be the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: but nevertheless it might appear, that, if he had been converted, he was desiring the clerical office in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. A penitent he is, he seeks not anything save mercy alone. He must be recommended therefore both to your eyes and hearts. Him whom you see in hearts <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> ye, with eyes guard ye. See ye him, mark ye him, and wherever he shall have gone his way, to the rest of the brethren that now are not here, point him out: and such diligence is mercy; lest that leader astray drag back  his heart and take it by storm. Guard ye him, let there not escape you his conversation, his way: in order that by your testimony it may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to us that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to the Lord he has been turned. For report will not be silent about his life, when to you he is thus presented both to be seen and to be pitied. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in the Acts of the Apostles how it is written, that many lost men, that is, men of such arts, and followers of naughty doctrines, brought unto the Apostles all their books; and there were burned so many volumes, that it was the writer's task to make a valuation of them, and write down the sum of the price. <span class="stiki" id="note182456"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse19">Acts&nbsp;19:19</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> was for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that even such lost men might not be despaired of by Him that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to seek that which had been lost. Therefore this man had been lost, is now sought, found, <span class="stiki" id="note182457"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;15:32</a></span> led hither, he brings with him books to be burned, by which he had been to be burned, so that when these have been thrown into the fire, he may himself pass over into a place of refreshment. Know ye that he, brethren, once knocked at the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> door before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>:  for before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> he began to ask of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Christ's medicine. But because the art wherein he had been practised is of such sort as that it was suspected of lying and deceit, he was put off that he might not tempt; at length however he was admitted, that he might not more dangerously be tempted. Pray for him through Christ. Straightway today's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> pour out for him to the Lord our God. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and are sure, that your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> effaces all his impieties. The Lord be with you.</p>
