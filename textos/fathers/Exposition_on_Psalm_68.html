<h1>Exposition on Psalm 68</h1>


<p>1. Of this Psalm, the title seems not to need operose discussion: for simple and easy it appears. For thus it stands: <q>For the end, for David himself a Psalm of a Song.</q> But in many Psalms already we have reminded you what is <q>at the end: for the end of the Law is Christ for righteousness to every man believing:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182685"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> He is the end which makes perfect, not that which consumes or destroys. Nevertheless, if any one endeavours to inquire, what means, <q>a Psalm of a Song:</q> why not either <q>Psalm</q> or <q>Song,</q> but both; or what is the difference between Psalm of Song, and Song of Psalm, because even thus of some Psalms the titles are inscribed: he will find perchance something which we leave for men more acute and more at leisure than ourselves....</p>

<p>2. <q>Let God rise up, and let His enemies be scattered</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse1">Psalm 67:1</a></span>. Already this has come to pass, Christ has risen up, <q>who is over all things, God blessed for ever,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182686"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> and His enemies have been dispersed through all nations, to wit, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; in that very place, where they practised their enmities, being overthrown in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and thence through all places dispersed: and now they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and in that very <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> they do that which follows, <q>And let them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> Him flee from His face.</q> The flight indeed of the mind is <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For in carnal flight, whither flee they from the face of Him who everywhere shows the efficacy  of His presence? <q>Whither shall I depart,</q> says he, <q>from Your Spirit, and from Your face whither shall I flee?</q>  With <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, therefore, not with body, they flee; to wit, by being afraid, not by being hidden; and not from that face which they see not, but from that which they are compelled to see. For the face of Him has His presence in His Church been called....</p>

<p>3. <q>As smoke fails, let them fail</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse2">Psalm 67:2</a></span>. For they lifted up themselves from the fires of their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> unto the vapouring of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and against <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> setting their mouth, and shouting, <q>Crucify, Crucify,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182689"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;19:6</a></span> Him taken captive they derided, Him hanging they mocked: and being soon conquered by that very Person against whom they swelled victorious, they vanished away. <q>As wax melts from the face of fire, so let sinners perish from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Though perchance in this passage he has referred to those men, whose hard-heartedness in tears of penitence is dissolved: yet this also may be understood, that he threatens future judgment; because though in this world like smoke, in lifting up themselves, that is, in priding themselves, they have melted away, there will come to them at the last final damnation, so that from His face they will perish for everlasting, when in His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He shall have appeared, like fire, for the punishment of the ungodly, and the light of the righteous.</p>

<p>4. Lastly, there follows, <q>And let just men be joyous, and exult in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let them delight in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse3">Psalm 67:3</a></span>. For then shall they hear, <q>Come, you blessed of My Father, receive ye the kingdom.</q>  <q>Let them be joyous,</q> therefore, that have toiled, <q>and exult in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For there will not be in this exultation, as though it were before men, any empty boasting; but (it will be) in the sight of Him who unerringly looks into that which He has granted. <q>Let them delight in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>:</q> no longer exulting with trembling,  as in this world, so long as <q><a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life is a trial upon earth.</q>  Secondly, he turns himself to those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom he has given so great hope, and to them while here living he speaks and exhorts: <q>Sing ye to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, psalm ye to His name</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse4">Psalm 67:4</a></span>. Already on this subject in the exposition of the Title we have before spoken that which seemed meet. He sings to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that lives to God: He psalms to His name, that works unto His Glory. In singing thus, in psalming thus, that is, by so living, by so working, <q>a way make ye to Him,</q> he says, <q>that has ascended above the setting.</q> A way make ye to Christ: so that through the beautiful feet of men telling good tidings, <span class="stiki" id="note182693"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;52:7</a></span> the hearts of men believing many have a way opened to Him. For the Same is He that has ascended above the <q>setting:</q> either because the new life of one turned to Him receives Him not, except the old life shall have set by his renouncing this world, or because He ascended above the setting, when by rising again He conquered the downfall of the body. <q>For The Lord is His name.</q> Which if they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> they never would have crucified. <span class="stiki" id="note182694"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> </p>

<p>5. <q>Exult ye in the sight of Him,</q> O you to whom has been said, <q>Sing ye to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, psalm ye to the name of Him, a way make ye to Him that has ascended above the setting,</q> also <q>exult in the sight of Him:</q> as if <q>sorrowful, yet always rejoicing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182695"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> For while you make a way to Him, while you prepare a way whereby He may come and possess the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, you are to suffer in the sight of men many sorrowful things. But not only faint not, but even exult, not in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>In hope rejoicing, in tribulation enduring:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182696"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;12:12</a></span> <q>exult ye in the sight of Him.</q> For they that in the sight of men trouble you, <q>shall be troubled by the face of Him, the Father of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and Judge of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse5">Psalm 67:5</a></span>. For desolate they suppose them to be, from whom ofttimes by the sword of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> <span class="stiki" id="note182697"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> both <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> from sons, and husbands from wives, are severed: but <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> destitute and widowed have the consolation <q>of the Father of <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and Judge of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>:</q> they have the consolation of Him that say to Him, <q>For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord has taken up me:</q>  and they that have hoped in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, continuing in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> by night and by day: <span class="stiki" id="note182699"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:5</a></span> by whose face those men shall be troubled when they shall have seen themselves prevail nothing, for that the whole world has gone away after Him. <span class="stiki" id="note182700"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;12:19</a></span> For out of those <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, that is, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> destitute of partnership in this world's hope, the Lord for Himself does build a Temple: whereof in continuation he says, <q>The Lord is in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</q></p>

<p>6. For what is His place he has disclosed, when he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that makes to dwell men of one mood in a house</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse6">Psalm 67:6</a></span>: men of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, of one sentiment: this is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place of the Lord. For when he had said, <q>The Lord is in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place:</q> as though we were inquiring in what place, since He is everywhere wholly, and no place of corporal space contains Him; immediately he has subjoined somewhat, that we should not seek Him apart from ourselves, but rather being of one mood dwelling in a house, we should deserve that He also Himself deign to dwell among us. This is the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place of the Lord, the thing that most men seek to have, a place where in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> they may be hearkened unto....For as in a great house of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the Lord thereof does not abide in every place whatsoever, but in some place doubtless more private and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>: so God dwells not in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that are in His house (for He dwells not in the vessels of dishonour), but His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place are they whom <q>He makes to dwell of one mood,</q> or <q>of one manner, in a house.</q> For what are called <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;</span> in Greek, by both <em>modi</em> and <em>mores</em> (moods and manners), in Latin may be interpreted. Nor has the Greek writer, <q>Who makes to dwell,</q> but only <q>makes to dwell.</q> <q>The Lord,</q> then, <q>is in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</q>...</p>

<p>7. But to prove that by His Grace He builds to Himself this place, not for the sake of the merits preceding of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> out of whom He builds it, see what follows: <q>Who leads forth men fettered, in strength.</q> For He looses the heavy bonds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, wherewith they were fettered so that they could not walk in the way of the commandments: but He leads them forth <q>in strength,</q> which before His Grace they had not. <q>Likewise men provoking that dwell in the tombs:</q> that is, every way dead, taken up with dead works. For these men provoke Him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by withstanding <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: for those fettered men perchance would walk, and are not able, and are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> of God that they may be able, and are saying to Him, <q>From my necessities lead me forth.</q>  By whom being heard, they give thanks, saying, <q>You have broken asunder my bonds.</q>  But these provoking men that dwell in the tombs, are of that kind, which in another passage the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> points out, saying, <q>From a dead man, as from one that is not, confession perishes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182703"><a href="../bible/sir017.htm#verse28">Sirach&nbsp;17:28</a></span> Whence there is this saying, <q>When a sinner shall have come into the depth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, he despises.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182704"><a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse3">Proverbs&nbsp;18:3</a></span> For it is one thing to long for, another thing to fight against righteousness: one thing from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to desire to be delivered, another thing one's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doings to defend rather than to confess: both kinds nevertheless the Grace of Christ leads forth in strength. With what strength, but that wherewith against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> even unto blood they are to strive? For out of each kind are made meet <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, whereof to construct His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place; those being loosened, these being raised to life. For even of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whom <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> had bound for eighteen years, by His command He loosed the bonds; <span class="stiki" id="note182705"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse16">Luke&nbsp;13:16</a></span> and Lazarus' death by His voice He overcame. <span class="stiki" id="note182706"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;11:43</a></span> He that has done these things in bodies, is able to do more marvellous things in characters, and to make men of one mood to dwell in a house: <q>leading forth men fettered in strength, likewise men provoking that dwell in the tombs.</q> </p>

<p>8. <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when You went forth before Your people</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse7">Psalm 67:7</a></span>. His going forth is perceived, when He appears in His works. But He appears not to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but to them that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to spy out His works. For I do not now speak of those works which are conspicuous to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and earth and sea and all things that in them are; but the works whereby He leads forth men fettered in strength, likewise men provoking that dwell in the tombs, and makes them of one manner to dwell in a house. Thus He goes forth before His people, that is, before those that do perceive this His Grace. Lastly, there follows, <q>When You went by in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, the earth was moved</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse8">Psalm 67:8</a></span>. A desert were the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not God: a desert they were, where by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself no law had been given, where no Prophet had dwelled, and foretold the Lord to come. <q>When,</q> then, <q>You went by in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>,</q> when You were preached in the nations; <q>the earth was moved,</q> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> earthly men were stirred up. But whence was it moved? <q>For the heavens dropped from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Perchance here some one calls to mind that time, when in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> God was going over before His people, before the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, by day in the pillar of cloud, by night in the brightness of fire; <span class="stiki" id="note182708"><a href="../bible/exo013.htm#verse21">Exodus&nbsp;13:21</a></span> and determines that thus it is that <q>the heavens dropped from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> for manna He rained upon His people: <span class="stiki" id="note182709"><a href="../bible/exo016.htm#verse15">Exodus&nbsp;16:15</a></span> that the same thing also is that which follows, <q>Mount Sina from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q>  <q>with <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rain severing God to Your inheritance</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse9">Psalm 67:9</a></span>, namely, the God that on Mount Sina spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when He gave the Law, so that the manna is the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rain, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> severed for His inheritance, that is, for His people; because them alone He so fed, not the other nations also: so that what next he says, <q>and it was weakened,</q> is understood of the inheritance being itself weakened; for they murmuring, fastidiously loathed the manna, longing for victuals of flesh, and those things on which they had been accustomed to live in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note182711"><a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse5">Numbers&nbsp;11:5-6</a></span> ... Lastly, all those men in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> were stricken down, nor were any of them except two found worthy to go into the land of promise. <span class="stiki" id="note182712"><a href="../bible/num014.htm#verse23">Numbers&nbsp;14:23-24</a></span> Although even if in the sons of them that inheritance be said to have been perfected, we ought more readily to hold to a spiritual sense. For all those things in a figure did happen to them; <span class="stiki" id="note182713"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:11</a></span> until the day should break, and the shadows should be removed. <span class="stiki" id="note182714"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse17">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:17</a></span> </p>

<p>9. May then the Lord open to us that knock; and may the secret things of His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, as far as Himself vouchsafes, be disclosed. For in order that the earth might be moved to the Truth when into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was passing, <q>the Heavens dropped from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> These are the Heavens, whereof in another Psalm is sung, <q>The Heavens are telling forth the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>. .. So here also, <q>the Heavens dropped;</q> but <q>from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For even these very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have been <q>saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and this not of themselves, but God's gift it is, not of works, lest perchance any man should be lifted up. For of Himself we are the workmanship,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182716"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;2:8-10</a></span> <q>that makes men of one mood to dwell in a house.</q> </p>

<p>10. But what is that which follows, <q>Mount Sina from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q>? Must there be understood <q>dropped;</q> so that what he has called by the name of Heavens, the same he has willed to be understood under the name of Mount Sina also; just as we said that those are called mountains, which were called Heavens? Nor in this sense ought it to move us that He says <q>mountain,</q> not mountains, while in that place they were called <q>Heavens,</q> not <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>: for in another Psalm also after it had been said, <q>The Heavens are telling forth the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God:</q>  after the manner of Scripture repeating the same sense in different words, subsequently there is said, <q>And the firmament tells the works of His hands.</q>  First he said <q>Heavens,</q> not <q><a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>:</q> and yet afterwards not <q>firmaments,</q> but <q>firmament.</q> For God called the firmament <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note182720"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;1:8</a></span> as in Genesis has been written. Thus then Heavens and <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, mountains and mountain, are not a different thing, but the very same thing: just as Churches many, and the One Church, are not a different thing, but the very same thing. Why then <q>Mount Sina, which genders unto bondage</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note182721"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;4:24</a></span> as says the Apostle. Is perchance the Law itself to be understood in Mount Sina, as that which <q>the Heavens dropped from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> in order that the earth might be moved? And is this the very moving of the earth, when men are troubled, because the Law they cannot fulfil? But if so it is, this is the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rain, whereof in confirmation he says, <q>Voluntary rain God severing to Your inheritance:</q> because <q>He has not done so to any nation, and His judgment He has not manifested to them.</q>  God therefore set apart this <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rain to His inheritance because He gave the Law. And <q>there was made weak,</q> either the Law, or the inheritance. The Law may be understood to have been made weak, because it was not fulfilled; not that of itself it is weak, but because it makes men weak, by threatening punishment, and not aiding through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For also the very word the Apostle has used, where he says, <q>For that which was impossible of the Law, wherein it was made weak through the flesh:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182723"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3</a></span> willing to intimate that through the Spirit it is fulfilled: nevertheless, itself he has said is made weak, because by weak men it cannot be fulfilled. But the inheritance, that is, the people, without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> is understood to have been made weak by the giving to them of the Law. For <q>the Law came in, that transgression might abound.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182724"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> But that which follows, <q>But You have made it perfect,</q> to the Law is thus referred, forasmuch as it is made perfect, that is, is fulfilled after that which the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>I have not come to annul the Law, but to fulfil.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182725"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> ... There is in these words yet another sense: which seems to me more to approve itself. For much more in accordance with the context, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself is understood to be the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> rain,  because with no preceding merits of works it is given <em>gratis.</em>  <q>For if <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, no longer of works: otherwise <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> no longer is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182728"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;11:6</a></span> ...<q>But to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> men He gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182729"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James&nbsp;4:6</a></span> And it was made weak, but You have made it perfect: because <q><a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in weakness is perfected.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182730"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:9</a></span> Some copies indeed, both Latin and Greek, have not <q>Mount Sina;</q> but, <q>from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Sina, from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> That is, <q>The Heavens dropped from the face of God:</q> and, as if enquiry were made of what <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he says, <q>of Sina, from the face of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q> that is, from the face of the God that gave the Law to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.

Lastly, he continues, <q>You have prepared in Your own sweetness for the needy, O God.</q> <q>In Your own sweetness,</q> not in his meetness. For the needy he is, for he has been made weak, in order that he may be made perfect: he has acknowledged himself indigent, that he may be replenished. This is that sweetness, whereof in another place is said, <q>The Lord shall give sweetness, and our land shall give her fruit:</q>  in order that a good work may be done not for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; not for dread of punishment, but for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of righteousness. For this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and sound freedom. But the Lord has prepared this for one wanting, not for one abounding, whose reproach is that poverty: of which sort in another place is said, <q>Reproach to these men that abound, and contempt to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> men.</q>  For those he has called <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, whom he has called them that abound.</p>

<p>12. <q>The Lord shall give the Word</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse11">Psalm 67:11</a></span>: to wit, food for His animals which shall dwell therein. But what shall these animals work to whom He shall give the word? What but that which follows? <q>To them preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</q> With what <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but with that strength wherein He leads forth men fettered? Perchance also here he speaks of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, wherewith in preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> they wrought wondrous signs. Who then <q>shall give the Word to men preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a></q>? <q>The King,</q> he says, <q>of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the Beloved</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse12">Psalm 67:12</a></span>. The Father therefore is King of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the Son. For the Beloved, when there is not specified any person that is beloved, by a substitution of name, of the Only Son is understood. Is not the Son Himself King of His <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, to wit of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> serving Himself? Because with much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the King of Virtues shall give the Word to men preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, of Whom it has been said, <q>The Lord of Virtues, He is the King of Glory?</q>  But his not having said King of Virtues, but <q>King of the Virtues of the beloved,</q> is a most usual expression in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, if any one observe: which thing chiefly appears in those cases where even the person's own name is already expressed, so that it cannot at all be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that it is the same person of whom something is said. Of which sort also is that which in the Pentateuch in many passages is found: <q>And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did it, as the Lord commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</q> He said not that which is usual in our expressions, And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did, as the Lord commanded him; but, <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did as the Lord commanded <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q> as if one person were the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> whom He commanded, and another person the <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who did, whereas it is the very same. In the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> such expressions are most difficult to find. <span class="stiki" id="note182735"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;1:3-4</a></span> ...<q>The King,</q> therefore, <q>of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the Beloved,</q> thus may be understood, as if it were to be said, the King of His <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, because both King of Virtues is Christ, and the Beloved is the very same Christ. However, this sense has not so great urgency, as that no other can be accepted: because the Father also may be understood as King of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of His Beloved Son, to whom the Beloved Himself says, <q>All Mine are Yours, and Yours Mine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182736"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;17:10</a></span> But if perchance it is asked, whether <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> can be called King also, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether any one would dare to withhold this name from Him in the passage where the Apostle says, <q>But to the King of ages, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, invisible, the only God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182737"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:17</a></span> Because even if this be said of the Trinity itself, therein is also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. But if we do not carnally understand, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your Judgment to the King give Thou, and Your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the Son of the King:</q>  I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether anything else has been said than, <q>to Your Son.</q> King therefore is the Father also. Whence that verse of this Psalm, <q>King of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the Beloved;</q> in either way may be understood. When therefore he had said, <q>The Lord shall give the Word to men preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>:</q> because <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself by Him is ruled, and serves Him by whom it is given; the Lord Himself, he says, who shall give the Word to men preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is the King of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the Beloved.</p>

<p>13. In the next place there follows, <q>Of the Beloved, and of the beauty of the House to divide the spoils.</q> The repetition belongs to eulogy.. .. But whether it be repeated, or whether it be received as spoken once, the word which has been set down, namely, <q>Beloved,</q>  I suppose that thus must be understood that which follows, <q>and of the beauty of a house to divide the spoils;</q> as if there were said, <q>Chosen even to divide the spoils of the beauty of a house,</q> that is, Chosen even for dividing the spoils. For beautiful Christ has made His House, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by dividing to Her spoils: in the same manner as the Body is beautiful in the distribution of the members. <q>Spoils</q> moreover those are called that are stripped off from conquered foes. What this is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> advises us in the passage where we read, <q>No one goes into the house of a strong man to spoil his vessels, unless first he shall have bound the strong man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182741"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;12:29</a></span> Christ therefore has bound the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with spiritual bonds, by overcoming death, and by ascending from Hell above the Heavens: He has bound him by the Sacrament of His Incarnation, because though finding nothing in Him deserving of death, yet he was permitted to kill: and from him so bound He took away his vessels as though they were spoils. For he was working in the sons of disobedience, <span class="stiki" id="note182742"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> of whose unbelief he made use to work his own will. These vessels the Lord cleansing by the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, sanctifying these spoils wrested from the foe laid prostrate and bound, these He has divided to the beauty of His House; making some <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, some <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, some pastors and doctors, <span class="stiki" id="note182743"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse11">Ephesians&nbsp;4:11</a></span> for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For as the body is one, and has many members, and though all the members of the body are many, the body is one: so also is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note182744"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:12</a></span> <q>Are all Apostles? Are all Prophets? Are all Powers? Have all the gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182745"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:29</a></span> <q>But all these things works one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one his own gifts, as He wills.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182746"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> And such is the beauty of the house, whereto the spoils are divided, that a lover thereof with this fairness being enkindled, cries out, <q>O Lord, I have loved the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Your House.</q> </p>

<p>14. Now in that which follows, he turns himself to address the members themselves, whereof the beauty of the House is composed, saying, <q>If you sleep in the midst of the lots,  wings of a dove silvered, and between the shoulders thereof in the freshness of gold</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse13">Psalm 67:13</a></span>. First, we must here examine the order of the words, in what manner the sentence is ended; which certainly awaits, when there is said, <q>If you sleep:</q> secondly, in that which he says, namely, <q>wings of dove silvered,</q> whether in the singular number it must be understood as being, <q>of this wing</q>  thereof, or in the plural as, <q>these wings.</q>  But the singular number the Greek excludes, where always in the plural we read it written. But still it is uncertain whether it be these wings; or whether, <q>O you wings,</q> so as that he may seem to speak to the wings themselves. Whether therefore by the words which have preceded, that sentence be ended, so that the order is, <q>The Lord shall give the Word to men preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> with much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if you sleep in the midst of the lots, O you wings of a dove silvered:</q> or by these which follow, so that the order is, <q>If you sleep in the midst of the lots, the wings of a dove silvered with snow shall be whitened in Selmon:</q> that is, the wings themselves shall be whitened, if you sleep in the midst <q>of the lots:</q> so that he may be understood to say this to them that are divided to the beauty of the House, as it were spoils; that is, if you sleep in the <q>midst of the lots,</q> O you that are divided to the beauty of the House, <q>through the manifestation of the Spirit unto profit,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182751"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7</a></span> so that <q>to one indeed is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q> etc., if then ye sleep in the midst of the lots, then the wings of a dove silvered with snow shall be whitened in Selmon. It may also be thus: <q>If you being the wings of a dove silvered, sleep in the midst of the lots, with snow they shall be whitened in Selmon,</q> so as that those men be understood who through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> receive remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Whence also of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Herself, is said in the Song of Songs, <q>Who is She that goes up whitened?</q> For this promise of God is held out through the Prophet, saying, <q>If your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall have been like scarlet, like snow I will whiten them.</q> It may also thus be understood, so that in that which has been said, <q>wings of a dove silvered,</q> there be understood, you shall be, so that this is the sense, O you that like as it were spoils to the beauty of the house are divided, if you sleep in the <q>midst of the lots,</q> wings of a dove silvered you shall be: that is, into higher places you shall be lifted up, adhering however to the bond of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For I think no other dove silvered can be better perceived here, than that whereof has been said, <q>One is My dove.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182752"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:9</a></span> But silvered She is because with divine sayings she has been instructed: for the sayings of the Lord in another place are called <q>silver with fire refined, purged sevenfold.</q>  Some great good thing therefore it is, to sleep in the midst of the lots, which some would have to be the Two Testaments, so that to <q>sleep in the midst of the lots</q>  is to rest on the authority of those Testaments, that is, to acquiesce in the testimony of either Testament: so that whenever anything out of them is produced and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, all strife is ended in peaceful acquiescence....</p>

<p>15. <q>Between the shoulders,</q> however. This is indeed a part of the body, it is a part about the region of the heart, at the hinder parts however, that is, at the back: which part of that dove silvered he says is <q>in the greenness of gold,</q> that is, in the vigour of wisdom, which vigour I think cannot be better understood than by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But why on the back, and not on the breast? Although I wonder in what sense this word is put in another Psalm, where there is said, <q>Between His shoulders He shall overshadow you, and under His wings you shall hope:</q>  forasmuch as under wings there cannot be overshadowed anything but what shall be under the breast. And in Latin, indeed, <q>between the shoulders,</q> perchance in some degree of both parts may be understood, both before and behind, that we may take shoulders to be the parts which have the head between them; and in Hebrew perchance the word is ambiguous, which may in this manner also be understood: but the word that is in the Greek, <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;<!--k29--&#183;&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;</span>, signifies not anything but at the back, which is <q>between the shoulders.</q> Is there for this reason there the greenness of gold, that is, wisdom and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because in that place there are in a manner the roots of the wings? Or because in that place is carried that light burden? For what are even the wings themselves, but the two commandments of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, whereon hangs the whole Law and the Prophets? <span class="stiki" id="note182756"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;22:40</a></span> what is that same light burden, but that same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>  which in these two commandments is fulfilled? For whatever thing is difficult in a commandment, is a light thing to a lover. Nor on any other account is rightly understood the saying, <q>My burden is light,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182758"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;11:30</a></span> but because He gives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whereby <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is shed abroad in our hearts, <span class="stiki" id="note182759"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> in order that in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we may do freely that which he that does in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> does slavishly; nor is he a lover of what is right, when he would prefer, if so be it were possible, that what is right should not be commanded.</p>

<p>16. It may also be required, when it has not been said, if you sleep in the lots, but <q>in the midst of the lots;</q> what this is, <q>in the midst of the lots.</q> Which expression indeed, if more exactly it were translated from the Greek, would signify, <q>in the midst between the lots,</q>  which is in no one of the interpreters I have read: therefore I suppose, that what has been said signifies much the same, to wit the expression, <q>in the midst of the lots.</q> Hence therefore what seems to me I will explain. Ofttimes this word is wont to be used for uniting and pacifying one thing and another, that they may not mutually disagree: as when God is establishing His covenant  between Himself and His people, this word the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> uses; for instead of that expression which is in Latin between Me and you, the Greek has, in the midst of Me and you. So also of the sign of Circumcision, when God speaks to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, He says, <q>There shall be a testament between Me and you and all your seed:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182762"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;17:4,&nbsp;7</a></span> which the Greek has, in the midst of Me and you, and the midst of your seed. Also when He was speaking to Noe of the bow in the clouds to establish a sign, <span class="stiki" id="note182763"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;9:12</a></span> this word very often He repeats: and that which the Latin copies have, between Me and you, or between Me and every living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and whatever suchlike expressions there are used, is found in the Greek to be, in the middle of Me and you, which is <span class="greek"><!--k29--&Dagger;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x1F70; &#x03BC;<!--k29--&#183;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>. David also and Jonathan establish a sign between them, <span class="stiki" id="note182764"><a href="../bible/1sa020.htm#verse42">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;20:42</a></span> that they may not disagree with a difference of thought: and that which in Latin is expressed, between both, in the middle of both, the Greek has expressed in the same word, which is <span class="greek"><!--k29--&Dagger;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x1F70; &#x03BC;<!--k29--&#183;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>. But it was best that in this passage of the Psalms our translators said not, <q>among the lots,</q> which expression is more suited to the Latin idiom; but, <q>in the midst of the lots,</q> as though <q>in the midst between the lots,</q> which rather is the reading in the Greek, and which is wont to be said in the case of those things which ought to have a mutual consent....But why in the <q>lots</q>  the Testaments should be perceived, though this word is Greek, and the Testament is not so named, the reason is, because through a testament is given inheritance, which in Greek is called <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, and an heir <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x1F79;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> Now <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x1FC6;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> in Greek is the term for lot, and lots according to the promise of God are called those parts of the inheritance which were distributed to the people. <span class="stiki" id="note182766"><a href="../bible/num018.htm#verse20">Numbers&nbsp;18:20</a></span> Whence the tribe of Levi was commanded not to have lot among their brethren, because they were sustained by <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> from them. For, I think, they that have been ordained in the grades of the Ecclesiastical Ministry have been called both Clergy and Clerks, because Matthias by lot was chosen, who we read was the first that was ordained by the Apostles. <span class="stiki" id="note182767"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse26">Acts&nbsp;1:26</a></span> Henceforth, because of inheritance which is given by testament, as though by that which is made that which makes, by the name of <q>lots</q> the Testaments themselves are signified.</p>

<p>17. Nevertheless, to me here another sense also occurs, if I mistake not, to be preferred; understanding by <em>cleri</em> the inheritances themselves: so that, whereas the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, although in a shadow significant of the future, is earthly felicity; but the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> is everlasting <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; to <q>sleep in the midst of the lots</q> is not too earnestly now to seek the former, and still patiently to look for the latter....And because so well they have slept, on them, as it were on wings now flies, and with praises is exalted, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: to wit, the Dove silvered, in order that by this fame of theirs, posterity having been invited to imitate them, while in like manner the rest also sleep, there may be added wings whereby even unto the end of the world sublimely she may be preached.</p>

<p>19. But this mountain he calls the <q>mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a mountain fruitful, a mountain full of curds</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse15">Psalm 67:15</a></span>, or <q>a mountain fat.</q> But here what else would he call fat but fruitful? For there is also a mountain called by that name, that is to say, Selmon. But what mountain ought we to understand by <q>the mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a mountain fruitful, a mountain full of curds,</q> but the same Lord Christ? Of whom also another Prophet says, <q>There shall be manifest in the last times the mountain of the Lord prepared on the top of the mountains</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note182778"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;2:2</a></span> He is Himself the <q>Mountain full of curds,</q>  because of the babes to be fed with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as though it were with milk; <span class="stiki" id="note182780"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> a mountain rich to strengthen and enrich them by the excellence of the gifts; for even the milk itself whence curd is made, in a wonderful manner signifies <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for it flows out of the overflowing of the mother's bowels, and of a sweet compassion unto babes freely it is poured forth. But in the Greek the case is doubtful, whether it be the nominative or the accusative: for in that language mountain is of the neuter gender, not of the masculine: therefore some Latin translators have not translated it, <q>unto the Mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> but, <q>the Mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> But I think, <q>unto Selmon the Mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> is better, that is, <q>unto</q> the Mountain of God which is called Selmon: according to the interpretation which, as we best could, we have explained above.</p>

<p>20. Secondly, in the expression, <q>Mountain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Mountain full of curds,</q> Mountain <q>fruitful,</q> let no one dare from this to compare the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> with the rest of the Saints, who are themselves also called mountains of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>....For there were not wanting men to call Him, some John Baptist, some Elias, some Jeremias, or one of the Prophets; <span class="stiki" id="note182781"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;16:14</a></span> He turns to them and says, <q>Why do ye <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>  mountains full of curds, a mountain,</q> he says, <q>wherein it has pleased God to dwell therein</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse16">Psalm 67:16</a></span>. <q>Why do ye <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>?</q>  For as they are a light, because to themselves also has been said, <q>You are the Light of the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182784"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;5:14</a></span> but something different has been called <q>the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light which enlightens every man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182785"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;1:9</a></span> so they are mountains; but far different is the Mountain <q>prepared on the top of the mountains.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182786"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;2:2</a></span> These mountains therefore in bearing that Mountain are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>: one of which mountains says, <q>but from me far be it to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, save in the Cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through whom to me the world has been crucified, and I to the world:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182787"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> so that <q>he has <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, not in himself, but in the Lord may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182788"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:31</a></span> <q>Why</q> then <q>do ye <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> mountains full of curds,</q> that <q>Mountain wherein it has pleased God to dwell therein</q>?

<p>21. Thus comes to pass that also which follows: <q>The Chariot of God is of ten thousands manifold:</q> or <q>of tens of thousands manifold:</q> or, <q>ten times thousand times manifold</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse17">Psalm 67:17</a></span>. For one Greek word, which has there been used, <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BB;<!--k29--&#183;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, each Latin interpreter has rendered as best he could, but in Latin it could not be adequately expressed: for a thousand with the Greeks is called <span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x1F77;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>, but <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;<!--k29--&#183;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span> are a number of tens of thousands: for one <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x1F70;&#x03C2;</span> are ten thousands. Thus a vast number of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, who by bearing God become in a manner the chariot  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he has signified under this name. By abiding in and guiding this, He conducts it, as though it were His Chariot, unto the end, as if unto some appointed place. For, <q>the beginning is Christ; secondly, that are of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, at the appearing of Him; then the end.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182795"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:23-24</a></span> This is Holy Church: which is that which follows, <q>thousands of men rejoicing.</q> For in hope they are joyful, until they be conducted unto the end, which now they look for through patience. <span class="stiki" id="note182796"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;12:12</a></span> For admirably, when he had said, <q>Thousands of men rejoicing:</q> immediately he added, <q>The Lord is in them.</q> That we may not wonder why they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, <q>The Lord is in them.</q> For through many tribulations we must needs enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note182797"><a href="../bible/act014.htm#verse22">Acts&nbsp;14:22</a></span> but, <q>The Lord is in them.</q> Therefore even if they are as it were sorrowful, yet always rejoicing, <span class="stiki" id="note182798"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> though not now in that same end, to which they have not yet come, yet in hope they are rejoicing, and in tribulation patient: for, <q>The Lord is in them, in Sina in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</q> In the interpretations of Hebrew names, we find Sina interpreted commandment: and some other interpretations it has, but I think this to be more agreeable to the present passage. For giving a reason why those thousands <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, whereof the Chariot of God does consist, <q>The Lord,</q> he says, <q>is in them, in Sins in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place:</q> that is, the Lord is in them, in the commandment; which commandment is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, as says the Apostle: <q>Therefore the law indeed is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the commandment is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and just, and good.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182799"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;7:12</a></span> ...</p>

<p>22. In the next place, turning his address to the Lord Himself, <q>You have gone up,</q> he says, <q>on high, You have led captivity captive, You have received gifts in men</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse18">Psalm 67:18</a></span>. Of this the Apostle thus makes mention, thus expounds in speaking of the Lord Christ: <q>But unto each one of us,</q> he says, <q>is given <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> after the measure of the giving of Christ: for which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> he says, He has gone up on high, He has led captive captivity, He has given gifts to men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182800"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse7">Ephesians&nbsp;4:7-8</a></span> ...And let it not move us that the Apostle making mention of that same testimony says not, <q>You have received gifts in men;</q> but, <q>He has given gifts unto men.</q> For he with Apostolic authority has spoken thus according to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that the Son is God with the Father. For in respect of this He has given gifts to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, sending to them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which is the Spirit of the Father and of the Son. But forasmuch as the self-same Christ is understood in His Body which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, wherefore also His members are His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, whence to them is said, <q>But you are the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the members,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182801"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:27</a></span> doubtless He has Himself also received gifts in men. Now Christ has gone up on high, and sits at the right hand of the Father: <span class="stiki" id="note182802"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse19">Mark&nbsp;16:19</a></span> but unless He were here also on the earth, He would not thence have cried, <q>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182803"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4</a></span> When the Same says Himself, <q>Inasmuch as to one of My least you have done it, to Me you have done it:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182804"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;25:40</a></span> why do we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that He receives in His members, the gifts which the members of Him receive?</p> 

<p>23. But what is, <q>You have led captivity captive</q>? Is it because He has conquered death, which was holding captive those over whom it reigned? Or has he called men themselves captivity, who were being held captive under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? Which thing's <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> even the title of that Psalm  does contain, to wit, <q>when the house was being built after the captivity:</q> that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> after the coming in of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Calling therefore those very men who were being held captive a captivity, as when <q>the service</q>  is spoken of there are understood those that serve also, that same captivity he says by Christ has been led captive. For why should not captivity be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, if even for a good purpose men may be caught? Whence to Peter has been said, <q>From henceforth you shall catch men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182807"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;5:10</a></span> Led captive therefore they are because caught, and caught because subjugated, being sent under that gentle yoke, <span class="stiki" id="note182808"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;11:30</a></span> being delivered from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereof they were servants, and being made servants of righteousness <span class="stiki" id="note182809"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;6:18</a></span> whereof they were children. Whence also He is Himself in them, that has given gifts to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and has received gifts in men. And thus in that captivity, in that servitude, in that chariot, under that yoke, there are not thousands of men lamenting, but thousands of men rejoicing. For the Lord is in them, in Sina, in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.. ..</p>

<p>24. But what next does he adjoin? <q>For they that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not to dwell</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse18">Psalm 67:18</a></span>: or, as some copies have, <q>For not believing to dwell:</q> for what else are men not believing, but they that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not? To whom this has been said, is not easy to perceive. For as though a reason were being given of the above words, when it had been said, <q>You have led captivity captive, You have received gifts in men:</q> there has been added in continuation, <q>for they that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not to dwell,</q> that is, not believing that they should dwell. What is this? Of whom says he this? Did that captivity, before it passed into a good captivity, show whence it was an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> captivity? For through not believing they were possessed by the enemy, <q>that works in the sons of unbelief: among whom you were sometime, while you were living among them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182811"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> By the gifts therefore of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He that has received gifts in men, has led captive that captivity. For they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not that they should dwell. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has thence delivered them, in order that now believing they may dwell in the House of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even they too becoming the House of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Chariot of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, consisting of thousands of men rejoicing.</p>

<p>25. Whence he that was singing of these things, in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> foreseeing them, even he too being fulfilled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> has burst forth  a hymn, saying, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a> is blessed, blessed is the Lord God from day unto day</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse19">Psalm 67:19</a></span>. Which some copies have, <q>by day daily,</q> because the Greeks have it thus, <span class="greek">&#x1F21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BC;<!--k29--&#183;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;' &#x1F21;&#x03BC;<!--k29--&#183;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>: which more exactly would be expressed by, <q>by day daily.</q> Which expression I think signifies the same as that which has been said, to wit, <q>from day unto day.</q> For daily this He does even unto the end, He leads captive captivity, receiving gifts in men.</p>

<p>26. And because He leads that chariot unto the end, He continues and says, <q>A prosperous journey there shall make for us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our healths, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of making men safe</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse20">Psalm 67:20</a></span>. Highly is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> here commended. For who would be safe, unless He Himself should make whole? But that it might not occur to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, Why then do we die, if through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we have been made safe? Immediately he added below, <q>and the Lord's is the outgoing of death:</q> as though he were saying, Why are thou indignant, O lot of humanity, that you have the outgoing of death? Even your Lord's outgoing was no other than that of death. Rather therefore be comforted than be indignant: for even <q>the Lord's is the outgoing of death.</q> <q>For by hope we have been saved: but if that which we see not we hope for, through patience we wait for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182813"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24-25</a></span> Patiently therefore even death itself let us suffer, by the example of Him, who though by no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He was debtor to death, and was the Lord, from whom no one could take away life, but Himself laid it down of Himself, yet had Himself the outgoing of death.</p>

<p>27. <q>Nevertheless, God shall break in pieces the heads of His enemies, the scalp of hair of men walking on in their transgressions</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse21">Psalm 67:21</a></span>: that is, too much exalting themselves, being too <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> in their transgressions: wherein at least they ought to be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, saying, <q>O Lord, be  merciful to me a sinner.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182814"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;18:13</a></span> But He shall break in pieces their heads: for he that exalts himself shall be humbled. <span class="stiki" id="note182815"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;18:14</a></span> And thus though even of the Lord be the outgoing of death: nevertheless the same Lord, because He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and died after the flesh of His own will, not of necessity, <q>shall  break in pieces the heads of His enemies:</q> not only of those who mocked and crucified Him, and wagged their heads, and said, <q>If <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> He is, let Him come down from the Cross;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182817"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;27:40</a></span> but also of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> lifting up themselves against His doctrine, and deriding His death as though it were of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For that very same One of whom has been said, <q>Others He saved, Himself He cannot  save,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182818"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;27:42</a></span> is the <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our healths,</q> and is the <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of saving men:</q> but for an example of humility and of patience, and to efface the handwriting of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He even willed that the outgoing of death should be His own, that we might not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that death, but rather this from which He has delivered us through that. Nevertheless, though mocked and dead, <q>He shall break  in pieces the heads of His enemies,</q> of whom He says, <q>Raise  me up, and I shall render to them:</q>  whether it be <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, while to Himself He subdues the heads of them believing, or whether just things for <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> things, while He punishes the heads of them <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. For in either way are shattered and broken the heads of enemies, when from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> they are thrown down, whether by humility being amended, or whether unto the lowest depths of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> being hurled.</p>

<p>28. <q>The Lord has said, Out of Basan I will be turned</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse22">Psalm 67:22</a></span>: or, as some copies have, <q>Out of Basan I will turn.</q> For He turns that we may be safe, of whom above has been said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our healths, and God of saving men.</q>  For to Him elsewhere also is said, <q>O God of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, turn Thou us, and show Your face, and safe we shall be.</q>  Also in another place, <q>Turn us, O God of our healths.</q>  But he has said, <q>Out of Basan I will turn.</q> Basan is interpreted confusion. What is then, I will turn out of confusion, but that there is confounded because of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he that is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> of the mercy of God that they may be put away? Thence it is that the Publican dared not even to lift up his eyes to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note182824"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;18:13</a></span> so, on considering himself, was he confounded; but he went down justified, <span class="stiki" id="note182825"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;18:14</a></span> because <q>the Lord has said, Out of Basan I will turn.</q> Basan is also interpreted drought: and rightly the Lord is understood to turn out of drought, that is, out of scarcity. For they that think themselves to be in plenty, though they be famished; and full, though they be altogether empty; are not turned....<q>I will turn unto the deep of the sea.</q> If, <q>I will turn,</q> why, <q>unto the deep of the sea</q>? Unto Himself indeed the Lord turns, when savingly He turns, and He is not surely Himself the deep of the sea. Does perchance the Latin expression deceive us, and has there been put <q>unto the deep,</q> for a translation of what signifies <q>deeply</q>? For He does not turn Himself: but He turns those that in the deep of this world lie sunk down with the weight of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in that place where one that is turned says, <q>From the depths I have cried to You, O Lord.</q>  But if it is not, <q>I will turn,</q> but, <q>I will be turned unto the deep of the sea;</q> our Lord is understood to have said, how by His own mercy He was turned even unto the deep of the sea, to deliver even those that were sinners in most desperate case. Though in one Greek copy I have found, not, <q>unto the deep,</q> but <q>in the depths,</q> that is, <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD; &#x03B2;&#x03C5;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2;</span>: which strengthens the former sense, because even there God turns to Himself men crying from the depths. And even if He be understood Himself there to be turned, to deliver such sort also, it is not beside the purpose: and so then He turns, or else to deliver them is so turned, that His foot is stained in blood. Which to the Lord Himself the Prophet speaks: <q>That Your foot may be stained in blood</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse23">Psalm 67:23</a></span>: that is, in order that they themselves who are turned to You, or to deliver whom You are turned, though in the deep of the sea by the burden of iniquity they may have been sunk, may make so great proficiency by Your Grace (for where there has abounded <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there has superabounded <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <span class="stiki" id="note182827"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span>), that they may become Your foot among Your members, to preach Your <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and for Your name's sake drawing out a long <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, even unto blood they may contend. For thus, as I judge, more meetly is perceived His foot stained in blood.</p>

<p>29. Lastly, he adds, <q>The tongue of Your dogs out of enemies by Himself,</q> calling those very same that had been about to strive for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, even dogs, as though barking for their Lord. Not those dogs, whereof says the Apostle, <q>Beware of dogs:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182828"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse2">Philippians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> but those that eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters. For having confessed this, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Canaan merited to hear, <q>O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, great is your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, be it done to you as you will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182829"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;15:27-28</a></span> Dogs commendable, not abominable; observing fidelity towards their master, and before his house barking against enemies. Not only <q>of dogs</q> he has said, but <q>of Your dogs:</q> nor are their teeth praised, but their tongue is: for it was not indeed to no purpose, not without a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, that Gedeon was bidden to lead those alone, who should lap the water of the river like dogs; <span class="stiki" id="note182830"><a href="../bible/jdg007.htm#verse5">Judges&nbsp;7:5</a></span> and of such sort not more than three hundred among so great a multitude were found. In which number is the sign of the Cross because of the letter T, which in the Greek numeral characters signifies three hundred. Of such dogs in another Psalm also said, <q>They shall be turned at even, and hunger they shall suffer as dogs.</q>  For even some dogs have been reproved by the Prophet Isaiah, not because they were dogs, but because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not how to bark, and loved to sleep. <span class="stiki" id="note182832"><a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;56:10</a></span> In which place indeed he has shown, that if they had watched and barked for their Lord, they would have been praiseworthy dogs: just as they are praised, of whom is said, <q>The tongue of Your dogs.</q>...</p>

<p>30. <q>There have been seen Your steps, O God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse24">Psalm 67:24</a></span>. The steps are those wherewith You have come through the world, as though in that chariot You were going to traverse the round world; which chariot of clouds He intimates to be His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and faithful ones in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, where He says, <q>From this time  you shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> coming in the clouds.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182834"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse26">Mark&nbsp;13:26</a></span> Leaving out that coming wherein He shall be Judge of quick and dead, <span class="stiki" id="note182835"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:1</a></span> <q>From this time,</q> He says, <q>you shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> coming in clouds.</q> These <q>Your steps have been seen,</q> that is, have been manifested, by the revealing the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>. Whence has been said, <q>How beautiful are the feet of them that proclaim peace, that proclaim <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182836"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;10:15</a></span> For this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and those steps were lying hid in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>: but when there came the fullness of time, and it pleased God to reveal His Son, <span class="stiki" id="note182837"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> that He might be proclaimed among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, <q>there were seen Your steps, O God: the steps of my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of the  King who is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</q> In what <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, save in His Temple? <q>For the Temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> he says, <q>which you are.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182839"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> </p>

<p>31. But in order that those steps might be seen, <q>there went before princes conjoined with men psalming, in the midst of damsels players on timbrels</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse25">Psalm 67:25</a></span>. The princes are the Apostles: for they went before, that the peoples might come in multitudes. <q>They went before</q> proclaiming the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>: <q>conjoined with men psalming,</q> by whose good works that were even visible, as it were with instruments of praise, God was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. But those same princes are <q>in the midst of damsels players on timbrels,</q> to wit, in an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> ministry: for thus in the midst are ministers set over new Churches; for this is <q>damsels:</q> with flesh subdued praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for this is <q>players on timbrels,</q> because timbrels are made of skin dried and stretched.</p>

<p>32. Therefore, that no one should take these words in a carnal sense, and by these words should conceive in his mind certain choral bands of wantonness, he continues and says, <q>In the Churches bless ye the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse26">Psalm 67:26</a></span>: as though he were saying, wherefore, when you hear of damsels, players on timbrels, do ye think of wanton pleasures? <q>In the Churches bless ye the Lord.</q> For the Churches are pointed out to you by this mystic intimation: the Churches are the damsels, with new <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> decked: the Churches are the players on the timbrels, with chastened flesh being spiritually tuneful. <q>In the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>,</q> then, <q>bless ye the Lord God from the wells of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> For from thence He first chose those whom He made wells. For from thence were chosen the Apostles; and they first heard, <q>He that shall have drunk of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst, but there shall be made in him a well of water springing unto life everlasting.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182840"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span> </p>

<p>33. <q>There is Benjamin the younger in a trance</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse27">Psalm 67:27</a></span>. There is <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the last of the Apostles, who says, <q>For even I am an Israelite, out of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, out of the tribe of Benjamin.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182841"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse5">Philippians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> But evidently <q>in a trance,</q> all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> being amazed at a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> so great as that of his calling. For a trance is the mind's going out: which thing sometimes chances through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; but sometimes through some revelation, the mind suffering separation from the corporal senses, in order that that which is to be represented may be represented to the spirit. Whence even thus may be understood that which here has been written, namely, <q>in a trance;</q> for when to that persecutor there had been said  from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, <q>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182843"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4</a></span> there being taken from him the light of the eyes of flesh, he made answer to the Lord, whom in spirit he saw, but they that were with him heard the voice of him replying, though seeing no one to whom he was speaking. Here also the trance may be understood to be that one of his, whereof he himself speaking, says, that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> a man caught up even unto the third <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; but whether in the body, or whether out of the body, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not: <span class="stiki" id="note182844"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:2</a></span> but that he being caught up into Paradise, heard ineffable words, which it was not lawful for a man to speak. <q>Princes of Juda the leaders of them, princes of Zabulon, princes of Nephthalim.</q> Since he is indicating the Apostles as princes, wherein is even <q>Benjamin the younger in a trance,</q> in which words that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is indicated no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a>; or when under the name of princes there are indicated in the Churches all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> excelling and most worthy of imitation: what mean these names of the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?...For the names are Hebrew: whereof Juda is said to be interpreted confession, Zabulon habitation of strength, Nephthalim my enlargement. All which words do intimate to us the most proper princes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, worthy of their leadership, worthy of imitation, worthy of honours. For the Martyrs in the Churches hold the highest place, and by the crown of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> worth they do excel. But however in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> the first thing is confession, and for this is next put on strength to endure whatsoever shall have chanced; then after all things have been endured, straits being ended, breadth follows in reward. It may also thus be understood; that whereas the Apostle chiefly commends these three things, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note182845"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:13</a></span> confession is in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, strength in hope, breadth in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the substance is, that with the heart men <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unto righteousness, but with the mouth confession be made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note182846"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;10:10</a></span> But in sufferings of tribulations the thing itself is sorrowful, but the hope is strong. For, <q>if that which we see not we hope for, through patience we wait for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182847"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;8:25</a></span> But breadth the shedding abroad of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the heart does give. For <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> perfected casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>:</q> which <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <q>has torment,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182848"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> because of the straits of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>....</p>

<p>34. <q>Command, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Your Virtue</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse28">Psalm 67:28</a></span>.

<p>35. <q>From Your Temple in Jerusalem, to You kings shall offer presents</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse29">Psalm 67:29</a></span>. Jerusalem, which is our free mother, <span class="stiki" id="note182853"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse26">Galatians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> because the same also is Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Temple: from that Temple then, <q>to You kings shall offer presents.</q> Whatever kings be understood, whether kings of the earth, or whether those whom <q>He that is above the heavens distinguishes over the dove silvered;</q> <q>to You kings shall offer presents.</q> And what presents are so acceptable  as the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of praise? But there is a noise against this praise, from men bearing the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and having diverse opinions. Be there done that which follows, <q>Rebuke  the beasts of the cane</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse30">Psalm 67:30</a></span>. For both beasts they are, since by not understanding they do hurt: and beasts of the cane they are, since the sense of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> they wrest according to their own misapprehension. For in the cane the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are as reasonably perceived, as language in tongue, according to the mode of expression whereby the Hebrew or the Greek or the Latin tongue is spoken of, or the like; that is to say, by the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the thing which is being effected is implied. Now it is usual in the Latin language for writing to be called style, because with the <em>stilus</em> it is done: so then cane also, because with a cane it is done. The Apostle Peter says, that <q>men unlearned and unstable do wrest the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> to their own proper destruction:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182856"><a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:16</a></span> these are the beasts of the cane, whereof here is said, <q>Rebuke  the beasts of the cane.</q></p>

<p>36. Concerning these also is that which follows, <q>The congregation of bulls amid the cows of the peoples, in order that there may be excluded they that have been tried with silver.</q>  Calling them bulls because of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of a stiff and untamed neck: for he is referring to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But by <q>the cows of the peoples,</q> I think <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> easily led astray must be understood, because easily they follow these bulls. For they lead not astray entire peoples, among whom are men grave and stable; whence has been written, <q>In a people grave I will praise You:</q>  but only the cows which they may have found among those peoples. <q>For of these are they that steal into houses, and lead captive silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who are led with various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, always learning, and at the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> never arriving.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182859"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:6-7</a></span> ...For, <q>may be excluded,</q> has been said, meaning, may appear, may stand forth: as he says, <q>may be made manifest.</q> Whence also, in the art of the silversmith, they are called <em>exclusores</em>, who out of the shapelessness of the lump are skilled to mould the form of a vessel. For many meanings of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> are concealed, and are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only to a few of singular intelligence, and are never vindicated so suitably and acceptably as when our diligence to make answer to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> constrains us. For then even they that neglect the pursuits of learning, shaking off their slumber, are stirred up to a diligent hearing, in order that their opponents may be refuted. In a word, how many senses of <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> concerning Christ as God have been vindicated against Photinus, how many concerning Christ as man against Manich&aelig;us, how many concerning the Trinity against Sabellius, how many concerning the Unity of the Trinity against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, Eunomians, Macedonians? How many concerning the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the whole world spread abroad, against <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, and Luciferians, and others, whoever they be, that with like <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> dissent from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: how many against the rest of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, whom to enumerate or mention were too long a task, and for the present work unnecessary?...Of whom, as it were bulls, that is, not subject to the peaceful and gentle yoke of discipline, the Apostle makes mention, in the place where he has said that such an one must be chosen for the Episcopate as is <q>able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers. For there are many unruly;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182860"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse9">Titus&nbsp;1:9-10</a></span> these are bulls with uplifted neck, impatient of plough and yoke: vain-talkers and leaders astray of minds; which minds this Psalm has intimated under the name of cows....</p>

<p>37. <q>There shall come ambassadors out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> shall prevent the hands of Him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse31">Psalm 67:31</a></span>. Under the name of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> or of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, he has signified the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all nations, from a part the whole: calling the preachers of reconciliation ambassadors. <q>For Christ,</q> he says, <q>we have an embassy, God as it were exhorting through us: we beseech you for Christ to be reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182861"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:20</a></span> Not then of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> alone, whence the Apostles were chosen, but also from the rest of the nations that there should be preachers of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peace, in this manner has been <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> prophesied. But by that which he says, <q>shall prevent the hands of Him,</q> he says this, shall prevent the vengeance of Him: to wit, by turning to Him, in order that their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> may be forgiven, lest by continuing sinners they be punished. Which thing also in another Psalm is said, <q>Let us come before  the face of Him in confession.</q>  As by hands he signifies vengeance, so by face, revelation and presence, which will be in the Judgment. Because then, by <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> he has signified the nations of the whole world; immediately he has subjoined, <q>to God (are) the kingdoms of the earth.</q> Not to Sabellius, not to <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, not to Donatus, not to the rest of the bulls stiff-necked, but <q>to God (are) the kingdoms of the earth.</q> But the greater number of Latin copies, and especially the Greek, have the verses so punctuated, that there is not one verse in these words, <q>to God the kingdoms of the earth,</q> but, <q>to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> is at the end of the former verse, and so there is said, <q><a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> shall come before the hands of her to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and then there follows in another verse, <q>Kingdoms of the earth, sing ye to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, psalm ye to the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse32">Psalm 67:32</a></span>. By which punctuation, doubtless to be preferred by the agreement of many copies, and those deserving of credit, there seems to me to be implied <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which precedes works: because without the merits of good works through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the ungodly is justified, just as the Apostle said, <q>To one believing in Him that justifies the ungodly, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is counted for righteousness:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182864"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> in order that afterwards <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> may begin to work. For those alone are to be called good works,  which are done through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But these <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must needs go before, so that from thence these may begin, not from these this....This is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereof to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Herself is said in the Song of Songs, <q>You shall come and shall pass hence from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  For She has come  like the chariot of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in thousands of men rejoicing, having a prosperous course, and She has passed over from this world to the Father: in order that there may come to pass in Her that which the Bridegroom Himself says, who has passed hence from this world to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note182868"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;13:1</a></span> <q>I will that where I am, these also may be with Me:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182869"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;17:24</a></span> but from the beginning of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Because then in order that good works may follow, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does precede; and there are not any good works, save those which follow <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> preceding: nothing else seems to have been meant in, <q><a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> shall come before the hands of her to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> but, <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For thus she <q>shall come before the hands of her,</q> that is, the works of her. Of whom, except of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> herself? For this in the Greek is not ambiguous: for the word <q>of her</q>  there in the feminine gender most clearly has been put down. And thus nothing else has been said than <q><a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> shall come before her hands to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> that is, by believing in God she shall come before her works. For, <q>I judge,</q> says the Apostle, <q>that a man is justified through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without the works of the Law. Is He God of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only? Is He not also of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>?</q>  So then <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a>, which seems to be the utmost limit of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, is justified through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, without the works of the Law....For the expression in Greek, <span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03C1;&#x03B1; &#x03B1;&#x1F50;&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2;</span>, which most copies have, both of <q>hand of her</q> and <q>her own hand</q> may be understood: but that which is uncommon in the Greek copies, <span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C2; &#x03B1;&#x1F50;&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2;</span>, by both <q>hands of her</q> and <q>her own  hands,</q> in Latin may be expressed.</p>

<p>38. Henceforward, as if through <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> all things had been discoursed of which now we see fulfilled, he exhorts to the praise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and next He foretells His future Advent. <q>Kingdoms of earth, sing ye to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, psalm ye to the Lord: psalm ye to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has ascended above the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> of Heavens to the East</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse33">Psalm 67:33</a></span>. Or, as some copies have it, <q>who has ascended above the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> to the East.</q> In these words he perceives not Christ, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not His Resurrection and Ascension. But has not <q>to the East,</q> which he has added, expressed the very spot; since in the quarters of the East is where He rose again, and whence He ascended? Therefore above the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> He sits at the right hand of the Father. This is what the Apostle says, <q>the Same is He that has ascended above all Heavens.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182873"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse10">Ephesians&nbsp;4:10</a></span> For what of Heavens does remain after the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>? Which also we may call the Heavens of Heavens, just as He has called the firmament <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note182874"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;1:8</a></span> which <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, however, even as Heavens we read of, in the place where there is written, <q>and let the waters which are above the Heavens praise the name of the Lord.</q>  And forasmuch as from thence He is to come, <span class="stiki" id="note182876"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;1:11</a></span> to judge quick and dead, observe what follows: <q>behold, He shall give His voice, the voice of power.</q>  He that like a lamb before the shearer of Him was without voice, <span class="stiki" id="note182878"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span> <q>behold shall give His voice,</q> and not the voice of weakness, as though to be judged; but <q>the voice of power,</q> as though going to judge. For God shall not be hidden, as before, and in the judgment of men not opening His mouth; but <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come manifest, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He shall not be silent.</q>  Why do ye despair, you unbelieving men? Why do ye mock? What says the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> servant? <q>My Lord delays to come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note182880"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse45">Luke&nbsp;12:45</a></span> <q>Behold, He shall give His voice, the voice of power.</q></p>

<p>39. <q>Give ye <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, above <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is the magnificence of Him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse34">Psalm 67:34</a></span>.

<p>40. Lastly, lest of anything else the clouds be understood, he has in continuation added, <q>Wonderful is God in His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa067.htm#verse35">Psalm 67:35</a></span>.
