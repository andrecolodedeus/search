<h1>Exposition on Psalm 7</h1>

<p> <em>A psalm to David himself, which he sung to the Lord, for the words of Chusi, son of Jemini.</em> </p>

<p>1. Now the story which gave occasion to this <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> may be easily recognised in the second book of Kings. <span class="stiki" id="note180201"><a href="../bible/2sa015.htm#verse34">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;15:34-37</a></span> For there Chusi, the friend of king David, went over to the side of Abessalon, his son, who was carrying on <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against his father, for the purpose of discovering and reporting the designs which he was taking against his father, at the instigation of Achitophel, who had revolted from David's friendship, and was instructing by his counsel, to the best of his power, the son against the father. But since it is not the story itself which is to be the subject of consideration in this Psalm, from which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has taken a veil of <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, if we have passed over to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let the veil be taken away. <span class="stiki" id="note180202"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> And first let us inquire into the signification of the very names, what it means. For there have not been wanting interpreters, who investigating these same words, not carnally according to the letter, but spiritually, declare to us that Chusi should be interpreted silence; and Gemini, right-handed; Achitophel, brother's ruin. Among which interpretations, Judas, that traitor, again meets us, that Abessalon should bear his image, according to that interpretation of it as a father's peace; in that his father was full of thoughts of peace toward him: although he in his guile had <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in his heart, as was treated of in the third Psalm. Now as we find in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> are called sons, <span class="stiki" id="note180203"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;9:15</a></span> so in the same <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> we find they are called brethren also. For the Lord on the resurrection says, <q>Go and say to My brethren.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180204"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> And the Apostle calls Him <q>the first begotten among many brethren.</q> The ruin then of that <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, who betrayed Him, is rightly understood to be a brother's ruin, which we said is the interpretation of Achitophel. Now as to Chusi, from the interpretation of silence, it is rightly understood that our Lord contended against that guile in silence, that is, in that most deep secret, whereby <q>blindness happened in part to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180205"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;11:25</a></span> when they were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> the Lord, that the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might enter in, and <q>so all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> might be saved.</q> When the Apostle came to this profound secret and deep silence, he exclaimed, as if struck with a kind of awe of its very depth, <q>O the depth of the riches of the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out! For who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the wind of the Lord, or who has been His counsellor?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180206"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33-34</a></span> Thus that great silence he does not so much discover by explanation, as he sets forth its greatness in admiration. In this silence the Lord, hiding the sacrament of His adorable passion, turns the brother's <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> ruin, that is, His betrayer's impious <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, into the order of His mercy and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>: that what he with perverse mind wrought for one Man's destruction, He might by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> overruling dispose for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The perfect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> then, which is already worthy to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the secret of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sings a Psalm unto the Lord, she sings <q>for the words of Chusi,</q> because she has attained to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the words of that silence: for among unbelievers and persecutors there is that silence and secret. But among His own, to whom it is said, Now I call you no more servants; for the servant <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what his lord does; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of My Father I have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you: <span class="stiki" id="note180207"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;15:15</a></span> among His friends, I say, there is not the silence, but the words of the silence, that is, the meaning of that silence set forth and manifested. Which silence, that is, Chusi, is called the son of Gemini, that is, righthanded. For what was done for the Saints was not to be hidden from them. And yet He says, <q>Let not the left hand <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the right hand does.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180208"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;6:3</a></span> The perfect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> then, to which that secret has been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, sings in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> <q>for the words of Chusi,</q> that is, for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that same secret. Which secret God at her right hand, that is, favourable  and propitious unto her, has wrought. Wherefore this silence is called the Son of the right hand, which is, <q>Chusi, the son of Gemini.</q></p>

<p>2. <q>O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in You have I hoped: save me from all them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> me, and deliver me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse1">Psalm 7:1</a></span>. As one to whom, already perfected, all the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and enmity of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> being overcome, there remains no enemy but the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, he says, <q>Save me from all them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> me, and deliver me <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse2">Psalm 7:2</a></span>: lest at any time he tear my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as a lion.</q> The Apostle says, <q>Your adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180210"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> Therefore when the Psalmist said in the plural number, <q>Save me from all them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> me:</q> he afterwards introduced the singular, saying, <q>lest at any time he tear my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as a lion.</q> For he does not say, lest at any time they tear: he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what enemy and violent adversary of the perfect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> remained. <q>Whilst there be none to redeem, nor to save:</q> that is, lest he tear me, while Thou redeemest not, nor savest. For, if God redeem not, nor save, he tears. </p>

<p>3. And that it might be clear that the already perfect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is to be on her guard against the most insidious snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> only, says this, see what follows. <q>O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if I have done this</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse3">Psalm 7:3</a></span>. What is it that he calls <q>this</q>? Since he does not mention the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by name, are we to understand <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> generally? If this sense displease us, we may take that to be meant which follows: as if we had asked, what is this that you say, <q>this</q>? He answers, <q>If there be iniquity in my hands.</q> Now then it is clear that it is said of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <q>If I have repaid them that recompense me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse4">Psalm 7:4</a></span>. Which none can say with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but the perfect. For so the Lord says, <q>Be perfect, as your Father which is in heaven; who makes His sun to rise upon the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and rains on the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180212"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse43">Matthew&nbsp;5:43,&nbsp;45</a></span> He then who repays not them that recompense <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is perfect. When therefore the perfect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> <q>for the words of Chusi, the son of Jemini,</q> that is, for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that secret and silence, which the Lord, favourable to us and merciful, wrought for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, so as to endure, and with all patience bear, the guiles of this betrayer: as if He should say to this perfect <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, explaining the design of this secret, For you ungodly and a sinner, that your iniquities might be washed away by My blood-shedding, in great silence and great patience I bore with My betrayer; will you not imitate me, that you too may not repay <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Considering then, and understanding what the Lord has done for him, and by His example going on to perfection, the Psalmist says, <q>If I have repaid them that recompense me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>:</q> that is, if I have not done what You have taught me by Your example: <q>may I therefore fall by mine enemies empty.</q> And he says well, not, If I have repaid them that do me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but, who <q>recompense.</q> For who so recompenses, had received somewhat already. Now it is an instance of greater patience, not even to repay him <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who after receiving benefits returns <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for good, than if without receiving any previous benefit he had had a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to injure. If therefore he says, <q>I have repaid them that recompense me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>:</q> that is, If I have not imitated You in that silence, that is, in Your patience, which You have wrought for me, <q>may I fall by mine enemies empty.</q> For he is an empty boaster, who, being himself a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, desires to avenge himself on a man; and while he openly seeks to overcome a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, is secretly himself overcome by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, rendered empty by vain and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, because he could not, as it were, be conquered. The Psalmist <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> then where a greater victory may be obtained, and where <q>the Father which sees in secret will reward.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180213"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;6:6</a></span> Lest then he repay them that recompense <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he overcomes his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> rather than another man, being instructed too by those writings, wherein it is written, <q>Better is he that overcomes his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, than he that takes a city.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180214"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse32">Proverbs&nbsp;16:32</a></span> <q>If I have repaid them that recompense me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, may I therefore fall by my enemies empty.</q> He seems to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by way of execration, which is the heaviest kind of <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, as when one says, If I have done so and so, may I suffer so and so. But swearing in a swearer's mouth is one thing, in a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> meaning another. For here he mentions what will really befall men who repay them that recompense <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; not what, as by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he would imprecate on himself or any other.</p>

<p>4. <q>Let the enemy</q> therefore <q><a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and take it</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse5">Psalm 7:5</a></span>. By again naming the enemy in the singular number, he more and more clearly points out him whom he spoke of above as a lion. For he persecutes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and if he has deceived it, will take it. For the limit of men's rage is the destruction of the body; but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, after this visible death, they cannot keep in their power: whereas whatever <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> shall have taken by his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, he will keep. <q>And let him tread my life upon the earth:</q> that is, by treading let him make my life earth, that is to say, his food. For he is not only called a lion, but a serpent too, to whom it was said, <q>Earth shall you eat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180215"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;3:14</a></span> And to the sinner was it said, <q>Earth you are, and into earth shall you go.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180216"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> <q>And let him bring down my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the dust.</q> This is that dust which <q>the wind casts forth from the face of the earth,</q>  to wit, vain and silly boasting of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, puffed up, not of solid weight, as a cloud of dust carried away by the wind. Justly then has he here spoken of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which he would not have brought down to dust. For he would have it solidly established in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where there is no boasting. <q>He that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>,</q> says the Apostle, <q>let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180218"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:31</a></span> This solidity is brought down to the dust if one through <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> despising the secrecy of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, where God only proves a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, desires to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> before men. Hence comes what the Psalmist elsewhere says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall bruise the bones of them that please men.</q>  Now he that has well learned or experienced the steps in overcoming <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> of empty <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is either alone, or more than all, to be shunned by the perfect. For that by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> first fell, she overcomes the last. <q>For the beginning of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>:</q> and again, <q>The beginning of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is to depart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>5. <q>Arise, O Lord, in Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse6">Psalm 7:6</a></span>. Why yet does he, who we say is perfect, incite God to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>? Must we not see, whether he rather be not perfect, who, when he was being <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, said, <q>O Lord, lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note180221"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse60">Acts&nbsp;7:60</a></span> Or does the Psalmist <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> thus not against men, but against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, whose possession sinners and the ungodly are? He then does not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> against him in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, but in mercy, whosoever <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that that possession may be taken from him by that Lord <q>who justifies the ungodly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180222"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> For when the ungodly is justified, from ungodly he is made just, and from being the possession of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> he passes into the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And since it is a punishment that a possession, in which one longs to have rule, should be taken away from him: this punishment, that he should cease to possess those whom he now possesses, the Psalmist calls the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <q>Arise, O Lord; in Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> <q>Arise</q> (he has used it as <q>appear</q>), in words, that is, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and obscure; as though God sleeps, when He is unrecognised and hidden in His secret workings. <q>Be exalted in the borders of mine enemies.</q> He means by borders the possession itself, in which he wishes that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should be exalted, that is, be honoured and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, rather than the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, while the ungodly are justified and praise God. <q>And arise, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the commandment that You have given:</q> that is, since You have enjoined humility, appear in humility; and first fulfil what You have enjoined; that men by Your example overcoming <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> may not be possessed of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who against Your commandments advised to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, saying, <q>Eat, and your eyes shall be opened, and you shall be as gods.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180223"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;3:5</a></span> </p>

<p>6. <q>And the congregation of the people shall surround You.</q> This may be understood two ways. For the congregation of the people can be taken, either of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, or of them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>, both of which took place in the same humiliation of our Lord: in contempt of which the multitude of them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> surrounded Him; concerning which it is said, <q>Why have the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> raged, and the people meditated vain things?</q>  But of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> through His humiliation the multitude so surrounded Him, that it could be said with the greatest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <q>blindness in part is happened unto <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might come in:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180225"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;11:25</a></span> and again, <q>Ask of me, and I will give You the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> for Your inheritance, and the boundaries of the earth for Your possession.</q>  <q>And for their sakes return Thou on high:</q> that is, for the sake of this congregation return Thou on high: which He is understood to have done by His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> and ascension into heaven. For being thus <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> He gave the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which before His exaltation could not be given, as it is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not yet given, because that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180227"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;7:39</a></span> Having then returned on high for the sake of the congregation of the people, He sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: by whom the preachers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> being filled, filled the whole world with Churches.</p>

<p>7. It can be taken also in this sense: <q>Arise, O Lord, in Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and be exalted in the borders of mine enemies:</q> that is, arise in Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and let not mine enemies understand You; so that to <q>be exalted,</q> should be this, become high,  that You may not be understood; which has reference to the silence spoken of above. For it is of this exaltation thus said in another Psalm, <q>And He ascended upon Cherubim, and flew:</q> and, <q>He made darkness His secret place.</q>  In which exaltation, or concealment, when for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins'</a> desert they shall not understand You, who shall crucify You, <q>the congregation</q> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> <q>shall surround You.</q> For in His very humiliation He was exalted, that is, was not understood. So that, <q>And arise, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the commandment that You have given:</q> may have reference to this, that is, when Thou showest Yourself, be high or deep that mine enemies may not understand  You. Now sinners are the enemies of the just man, and the ungodly of the godly man. <q>And the congregation of the people shall surround You:</q> that is, by this very circumstance, that those who crucify You understand You not, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in You, and so <q>shall the congregation of the people surround You.</q> But what follows, if this be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning, has in it more pain, that it begins already to be perceived, than <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that it is understood. For it follows, <q>and for their sakes return Thou on high,</q> that is, and for the sake of this congregation of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, wherewith the Churches are crowded, return Thou on high, that is, again cease to be understood. What then is, <q>and for their sakes,</q> but that this congregation too will offend You, so that You may most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> foretell and say, <q>Thinkest Thou when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall come, He will find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180230"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;18:8</a></span> Again, of the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, who are understood to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, He says, <q>Because of their iniquity the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many shall wax cold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180231"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12</a></span> Since then even in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, that is, in that congregation of peoples and nations, where the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name has most widely spread, there shall be so great abundance of sinners, which is already, in great measure, perceived; is not that famine of the word <span class="stiki" id="note180232"><a href="../bible/amo008.htm#verse11">Amos&nbsp;8:11</a></span> here predicted, which has been threatened by another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also?

<p>8. But whether the former exposition of this place, or this last be the more suitable, without prejudice to any one better, or equal, or as good, it follows very consistently, <q>the Lord judges the people.</q> For whether He returned on high, when, after the resurrection, He ascended into heaven, well does it follow, <q>The Lord judges the people:</q> for that He will come from thence to judge the quick and the dead. Or whether He return on high, when the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> leaves sinful <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, for that of His coming it has been said, <q>Do you think the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> on His coming will find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180234"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;18:8</a></span> <q>The Lord</q> then <q>judges the people.</q> What Lord, but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>? <q>For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180235"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;5:22</a></span> Wherefore this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> perfectly, see how she fears not the day of judgment, and with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> secure longing says in her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Your kingdom come: judge me,</q> she says, <q>O Lord, according to my righteousness.</q> In the former Psalm a weak one was entreating, imploring rather the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than mentioning any desert of his own: since the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> came <q>to call sinners to repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180236"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;9:13</a></span> Therefore he had there said, <q>Save me, O Lord, for Your mercy's sake;</q>  that is, not for my desert's sake. But now, since being called he has held and kept the commandments which he received, he is bold to say, <q>Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my harmlessness, that is upon me.</q> This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> harmlessness, which harms not even an enemy. Accordingly, well does he require to be judged according to his harmlessness, who could say with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <q>If I have repaid them that recompense me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> As for what he added, <q>that is upon me,</q> it can refer not only to harmlessness, but can be understood also with reference to righteousness; that the sense should be this, Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to my harmlessness, which righteousness and harmlessness is upon me. By which addition he shows that this very thing, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is righteous and harmless, she has not by herself, but by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who gives brightness and light. For of this he says in another Psalm, <q>You, O Lord, wilt light my candle.</q>  And of John it is said, that <q>he was not the light, but bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180239"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse8">John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> <q>He was a burning and shining candle.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180240"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;5:35</a></span> That light then, whence <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as candles, are kindled, shines forth not with borrowed, but with original, brightness, which light is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. It is then so said, <q>According to my righteousness, and according to my harmlessness, that is upon me,</q> as if a burning and shining candle should say, Judge me according to the flame which is upon me, that is, not that wherewith  I am myself, but that whereby I shine enkindled of you.</p>

<p>9. <q>But let the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of sinners be consummated</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse9">Psalm 7:9</a></span>. He says, <q>be consummated,</q> be completed, according to that in the Apocalypse, <q>Let the righteous become more righteous, and let the filthy be filthy still.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180242"><a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse11">Revelation&nbsp;22:11</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of those men appears consummate, who crucified the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; but greater is theirs who will not live uprightly, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the precepts of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, for whom the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was crucified. <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of sinners,</q> then he says, <q>be consummated,</q> that is, arrive at the height of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that just judgment may be able to come at once. But since it is not only said, <q>Let the filthy be filthy still;</q> but it is said also, <q>Let the righteous become more righteous;</q> he joins on the words, <q>And You shall direct the righteous, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who searches the hearts and reins.</q> How then can the righteous be directed but in secret? When even by means of those things which, in the commencement of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ages, when as yet the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were oppressed by the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the men of this world, appeared marvellous to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, now that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name has begun to be in such high dignity, hypocrisy, that is pretence, has increased; of those, I mean, who by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> profession had rather please men than God. How then is the righteous man directed in so great confusion of pretence, save while God searches the hearts and reins; seeing all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> thoughts, which are meant by the word heart; and their delights, which are understood by the word reins? For the delight in things temporal and earthly is rightly ascribed to the reins; for that it is both the lower part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and that region where the pleasure of carnal generation dwells, through which man's nature is transferred into this life of care, and deceiving <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, by the succession of the race. God then, searching our heart, and perceiving that it is there where our treasure is, that is, in heaven; searching also the reins, and perceiving that we do not assent to flesh and blood, but delight ourselves in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, directs the righteous man in his inward <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> before Him, where no man sees, but He alone who perceives what each man thinks, and what delights each. For delight is the end of care; because to this end does each man strive by care and thought, that he may attain to his delight. He therefore sees our cares, who searches the heart. He sees too the ends of cares, that is delights, who narrowly searches the reins; that when He shall find that our cares incline neither to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, nor to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, nor to the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life, <span class="stiki" id="note180243"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:16</a></span> all which pass away as a shadow, but that they are raised upward to the joys of things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, which are spoilt by no change, He may direct the righteous, even He, the God who searches the hearts and reins. For our works, which we do in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and words, may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto men; but with what mind they are done, and to what end we would attain by means of them, He alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, the God who searches the hearts and reins.</p>

<p>10. <q>My righteous help is from the Lord, who makes whole the upright in heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse10">Psalm 7:10</a></span>. The offices of medicine are twofold, on the curing infirmity, the other the preserving health. According to the first it was said in the preceding Psalm, <q>Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak;</q>  according to the second it is said in this Psalm, <q>If there be iniquity in my hands, if I have repaid them that recompense me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, may I therefore  fall by my enemies empty.</q> For there the weak <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that he may be delivered, here one already whole that he may not change for the worse. According to the one it is there said, <q>Make me whole for Your mercy's sake;</q> according to this other it is here said, <q>Judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness.</q> For there he asks for a remedy to escape from disease; but here for protection from falling into disease. According to the former it is said, <q>Make me whole, O Lord, according to Your mercy:</q> according to the latter it is said, <q>My righteous help is from the Lord, who makes whole the upright in heart.</q> Both the one and the other makes men whole; but the former removes them from sickness into health, the latter preserves them in this health. Therefore there the help is merciful, because the sinner has no desert, who as yet longs to be justified, <q>believing on Him who justifies the ungodly;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180246"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> but here the help is righteous, because it is given to one already righteous. Let the sinner then who said, <q>I am weak,</q> say in the first place, <q>Make me whole, O Lord, for Your mercy's sake;</q> and here let the righteous man, who said, <q>If I have repaid them that recompense me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> say, <q>My righteous help is from the Lord, who makes whole the upright in heart.</q> For if he sets forth the medicine, by which we may be healed when weak, how much more that by which we may be kept in health. For if <q>while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us, how much more being now justified shall we be kept whole from <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> through Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180247"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;5:8-9</a></span> </p>

<p>11. <q>My righteous help is from the Lord, who makes whole the upright in heart.</q> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who searches the hearts and reins, directs the righteous; but with righteous help makes He whole the upright in heart. He does not as He searches the hearts and reins, so make whole the upright in heart and reins; for the thoughts are both bad in a depraved heart, and good in an upright heart; but delights which are not good belong to the reins, for they are more low and earthly; but those that are good not to the reins, but to the heart itself. Wherefore men cannot be so called upright in reins, as they are called upright in heart, since where the thought is, there at once the delight is too; which cannot be, unless when things divine and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> are thought of. <q>You have given,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in my heart,</q> when he had said, <q>The light of Your countenance has been stamped on us, O Lord.</q>  For although the phantoms of things temporal, which the mind <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> pictures to itself, when tossed by vain and mortal hope, to vain imagination oftentimes bring a delirious and maddened <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; yet this delight must be attributed not to the heart, but to the reins; for all these imaginations have been drawn from lower, that is, earthly and carnal things. Hence it comes, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who searches the hearts and reins, and perceives in the heart upright thoughts, in the reins no delights, affords righteous help to the upright in heart, where heavenly  delights are coupled with clean thoughts. And therefore when in another Psalm he had said, <q>Moreover even to-night my reins have chided me;</q> he went on to say as touching help, <q>I foresaw the Lord always in my sight, for He is on my right hand, that I should not be moved.</q>  Where he shows that he suffered suggestions only from the reins, not delights as well; for he had suffered these, then he would of course be moved. But he said, <q>The Lord is on my right hand, that I should not be moved;</q> and then he adds, <q>Wherefore was my heart delighted;</q> that the reins should have been able to chide, not delight him. The delight accordingly was produced not in the reins, but there, where against the chiding of the reins God was foreseen to be on the right hand, that is, in the heart.</p>

<p>12. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the righteous judge, strong  (in endurance) and long-suffering</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse11">Psalm 7:11</a></span>. What God is judge, but the Lord, who judges the people? He is righteous; who <q>shall render to every man according to his works.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180252"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;16:27</a></span> He is strong (in endurance); who, being most powerful, for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> bore even with ungodly persecutors. He is long-suffering; who did not immediately, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, hurry away to punishment, even those that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Him, but bore with them, that they might at length turn from that ungodliness to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and still He bears with them, reserving the last penalty for the last judgment, and up to this present time inviting sinners to repentance. <q>Not bringing in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> every day.</q> Perhaps <q>bringing in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a></q> is a more significant expression than being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> (and so we find it in the Greek  copies); that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, whereby He punishes, should not be in Him, but in the minds of those ministers who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the commandments of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through whom orders are given even to the lower ministries, who are called <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, to punish <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: whom even now the punishment of men delights not for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>' sake, in which they have no pleasure, but for <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>' sake. God then does not <q>bring in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> every day,</q> that is, He does not collect His ministers for vengeance every day. For now the patience of God invites to repentance: but in the last time, when men <q>through their hardness and impenitent heart shall have treasured up for themselves <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> in the day of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and revelation of the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note180254"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;2:5</a></span> then He will brandish His sword.</q></p>

<p>13. <q>Unless ye be converted,</q> He says, <q>He will brandish His sword</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse12">Psalm 7:12</a></span>. The Lord Man Himself may be taken to be God's double-edged sword, that is, His spear, which at His first coming He will not brandish, but hides as it were in the sheath of humiliation: but He will brandish it, when at the second coming to judge the quick and dead, in the manifest splendour of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, He shall flash light on His righteous ones, and terror on the ungodly. For in other copies, instead of, <q>He shall brandish His sword,</q> it has been written, <q>He shall make bright His spear:</q> by which word I think the last coming of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> most appropriately signified: seeing that is understood of His person, which another Psalm has, <q>Deliver, O Lord, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the ungodly,  Your spear from the enemies of Your hand. He has bent His bow, and made it ready.</q> The tenses of the words must not be altogether overlooked, how he has spoken of <q>the sword</q> in the future, <q>He will brandish;</q> of <q>the bow</q> in the past, <q>He has bent:</q> and these words of the past tense follow after. </p>

<p>14. <q>And in it He has prepared the instruments of death: He has wrought His arrows for the burning</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse13">Psalm 7:13</a></span>. That bow then I would readily take to be the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, in which by the strength of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, as by a sort of string, the hardness of the Old has been bent and subdued. From thence the Apostles are sent forth like arrows, or divine preachings are shot. Which arrows <q>He has wrought for the burning,</q> arrows, that is, whereby being stricken they might be inflamed with heavenly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For by what other arrows was she stricken, who says, <q>Bring me into the house of wine, place me among perfumes, crowd me among honey, for I have been wounded with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a></q>?  By what other arrows is he kindled, who, desirous of returning to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and coming back from wandering, asks for help against crafty tongues, and to whom it is said, <q>What shall be given you, or what added to you against the crafty tongue? Sharp arrows of the mighty, with devastating coals:</q>  that is, coals, whereby, when you are stricken and set on fire, you may burn with so great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, as to despise the tongues of all that resist you, and would recall you from your purpose, and to deride their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, saying, <q>Who shall separate me from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? For I am persuaded,</q> he says, <q>that neither death, nor life, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, nor principality, nor things present, not things to come, nor power, nor height, nor depth, nor other creature, shall be able to separate me from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</q>  Thus for the burning has He wrought His arrows. For in the Greek copies it is found thus, <q>He has wrought His arrows for the burning.</q> But most of the Latin copies  have <q>burning arrows.</q> But whether the arrows themselves burn, or make others burn, which of course they cannot do unless they burn themselves, the sense is complete.</p>

<p>15. But since he has said that the Lord has prepared not arrows only, but <q>instruments of death</q> too, in the bow, it may be asked, what are <q>instruments of death</q>? Are they, per-adventure, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>? For they too, out of the same bow, that is, out of the same Scriptures, light upon <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> not to be inflamed with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> but destroyed with poison: which does not happen but after their deserts: wherefore even this dispensation is to be assigned to the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, not that it makes men sinners, but that it orders them after they have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. For through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> reaching them with an ill purpose, they are forced to understand them ill, that this should be itself the punishment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: by whose death, nevertheless, the sons of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are, as it were by certain thorns, so to say, aroused from slumber, and make progress toward the understanding of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>. <q>For there must be also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, that they which are approved,</q> he says, <q>may be made manifest among you:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180261"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:19</a></span> that is, among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, seeing they are manifest to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Or has He haply ordained the same arrows to be at once instruments of death for the destruction of unbelievers, and wrought them burning, or for the burning, for the exercising of the faithful? For that is not false that the Apostle says, <q>To the one we are the savour of life unto life, to the other the savour of death unto death; and who is sufficient for these things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180262"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:16</a></span> It is no wonder then if the same Apostles be both instruments of death in those from whom they suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and fiery arrows to inflame the hearts of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>.</p>

<p>16. Now after this dispensation righteous judgment will come: of which the Psalmist so speaks, as that we may understand that each man's punishment is wrought out of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and his iniquity turned into vengeance: that we may not suppose that that tranquillity and ineffable light of God brings forth from Itself the means of punishing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but that it so orders <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that what have been delights to man in sinning, should be instruments to the Lord avenging. <q>Behold,</q> he says, <q>he has travailed with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.</q> Now what had he conceived, that he should travail with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>? <q>He has conceived,</q> he says, <q>toil.</q> Hence then comes that, <q>In toil shall you eat your bread.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180263"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Hence too that, <q>Come unto Me all you that toil and are heavy laden; for My yoke is easy, and My burden light.</q>  For toil will never cease, except one <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that which cannot be taken away against his will. For when those things are loved which we can lose against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, we must needs toil for them most miserably; and to obtain them, amid the straitnesses of earthly cares, while each desires to snatch them for himself, and to be beforehand with another, or to wrest it from him, must scheme <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Duly then, and quite in order, has he travailed with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, who has conceived toil. Now he brings forth what, save that with which he has travailed, although he has not travailed with that which he conceived? For that is not born, which is not conceived; but seed is conceived, that which is formed from the seed is born. Toil is then the seed of iniquity, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the conception of toil, that is, that first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to <q>depart from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180265"><a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse12">Sirach&nbsp;10:12</a></span> He then has travailed with <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, who has conceived toil. <q>And he has brought forth iniquity.</q> <q>Iniquity</q> is the same as <q><a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>:</q> he has brought forth then that with which he travailed. What follows next?</p>

<p>17. <q>He has opened a ditch, and dug it</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse15">Psalm 7:15</a></span>. To open a ditch is, in earthly matters, that is, as it were in the earth, to prepare deceit, that another fall therein, whom the unrighteous man wishes to deceive. Now this ditch is opened when consent is given to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suggestion of earthly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>: but it is dug when after consent we press on to actual work of deceit. But how can it be, that iniquity should rather hurt the righteous man against whom it proceeds, than the unrighteous heart whence it proceeds? Accordingly, the stealer of money, for instance, while he desires to inflict painful harm upon another, is himself maimed by the wound of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. Now who, even out of his right <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, sees not how great is the difference between these men, when one suffers the loss of money, the other of innocence? <q>He will fall</q> then <q>into the pit which he has made.</q> As it is said in another Psalm, <q>The Lord is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in executing judgments; the sinner is caught in the works of his own hands.</q> </p>

<p>18. <q>His toil shall be turned on his head, and his iniquity shall descend on his pate</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse16">Psalm 7:16</a></span>. For he had no mind to escape <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but was brought under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as a slave, so to say, as the Lord says, <q>Whosoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is a slave.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180267"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;8:34</a></span> His iniquity then will be upon him, when he is subject to his iniquity; for he could not say to the Lord, what the innocent and upright say, <q>My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the lifter up of my head.</q>  He then will be in such wise below, as that his iniquity may be above, and descend on him; for that it weighs him down and burdens him, and suffers him not to fly back to the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. This occurs, when in an ill regulated man reason is a slave, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> has dominion.</p>

<p>19. <q>I will confess to the Lord according to His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa007.htm#verse17">Psalm 7:17</a></span>. This is not the sinner's confession: for he says this, who said above most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, <q>If there be iniquity in my hands:</q> but it is a confession of God's <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, in which we speak thus, Verily, O Lord, You are just, in that  You both so protect the just, that  You enlighten them by Yourself; and so order sinners, that they be punished not by Your malice, but by their own. This confession so praises the Lord, that the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of the ungodly can avail nothing, who, willing to excuse their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, are unwilling to attribute to their own fault that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that is, are unwilling to attribute their fault to their fault. Accordingly they find either fortune or <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> to accuse, or the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to whom He who made us has willed that it should be in our power to refuse consent: or they bring in another nature, which is not of God: wretched waverers, and erring, rather than confessing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He should pardon them. For it is not fit that any be pardoned, except he says, I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. He, then, that sees the deserts of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> so ordered by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that while each has his own given him, the fair beauty of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is in no part violated, in all things praises God: and this is not the confession of sinners, but of the righteous. For it is not the sinner's confession when the Lord says, <q>I confess to You, O Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hid these things from the wise, and revealed them to babes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180269"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;11:25</a></span> Likewise in Ecclesiasticus it is said, <q>Confess to the Lord in all His works: and in confession you shall say this, All the works of the Lord are exceeding good.</q>  Which can be seen in this Psalm, if any one with a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, by the Lord's help, distinguish between the rewards of the righteous and the penalties of the sinners, how that in these two the whole creation, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made and rules, is adorned with a beauty wondrous and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to few. Thus then he says, <q>I will confess to the Lord according to His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>,</q> as one who saw that darkness was not made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but ordered nevertheless. For God said, <q>Let light be made, and light was made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180271"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;1:3</a></span> He did not say, Let darkness be made, and darkness was made: and yet He ordered it. And therefore it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> divided between the light, and the darkness: and God called the light day, and the darkness He called night.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180272"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;1:4-5</a></span> This is the distinction, He made the one and ordered it: but the other He made not, but yet He ordered this too. But now that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are signified by darkness, so is it seen in the Prophet, who says, <q>And your darkness shall be as the noon day:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180273"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse10">Isaiah&nbsp;58:10</a></span> and in the Apostle, who says, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is in darkness:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180274"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:11</a></span> and above all that text, <q>Let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180275"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;13:12</a></span> Not that there is any nature of darkness. For all nature, in so far as it is nature, is compelled to be. Now being belongs to light: not being to darkness. He then that leaves Him by whom he was made, and inclines to that whence he was made, that is, to nothing, is in this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> endarkened: and yet he does not utterly perish, but he is ordered among the lowest things. Therefore after the Psalmist said, <q>I will confess unto the Lord:</q> that we might not understand it of confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he adds lastly, <q>And I will sing to the name of the Lord most high.</q> Now singing has relation to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but repentance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to sadness.</p>

<p>20. This Psalm can also be taken in the person of the Lord Man: if only that which is there spoken in humiliation be referred to our weakness, which He bore. </p>
