<h1>Exposition on Psalm 78</h1>


<p>1. This Psalm  does contain the things which are said to have been done among the old people: but the new and latter people is being admonished, to beware that it be not ungrateful regarding the blessings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and provoke His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against it, whereas it ought to receive His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>....The Title thereof does first move and engage our attention. For it is not without reason inscribed, <q>Understanding  of Asaph:</q> but it is perchance because these words require a reader who does perceive not the voice which the surface utters, but some inward sense. Secondly, when about to narrate and mention all these things, which seem to need a hearer more than an expounder: <q>I will open,</q> he says, <q>in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> my mouth, I will declare propositions from the beginning.</q>  Who would not herein be awakened out of sleep? Who would dare to hurry over the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and propositions, reading them as if self-evident, while by their very names they signify that they ought to be sought out with deeper view? For a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> has on the surface thereof the similitude of something: and though it be a Greek word, it is now used as a Latin word. And it is observable, that in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, those which are called the similitudes of things are compared with things with which we have to do. But propositions, which in Greek are called <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B2;&#x1F75;&#x03BB;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>, are questions having something therein which is to be solved by disputation. What man then would read <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and propositions cursorily? What man would not attend while hearing these words with watchful <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in order that by understanding he may come by the fruit thereof?</p>

<p>2. <q>Hearken ye,</q> He says, <q>My people, to My law</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse1">Psalm 77:1</a></span>. Whom may we suppose to be here speaking, but God? For it was Himself that gave a law to His people, whom when delivered out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> He gathered together, the which gathering together is properly named a Synagogue, which the word Asaph is interpreted to signify. Hath it then been said, <q>Understanding of Asaph,</q> in the sense that Asaph himself has understood; or must it be figuratively understood, in the sense that the same Synagogue, that is, the same people, has understood, unto whom is said, <q>Hearken, My people, unto My law</q>? Why is it then that He is rebuking the same people by the mouth of the Prophet, saying, <q>But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, and My people has not understood</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note183524"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> But, in fact, there were even in that people they that understood, having the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was afterwards revealed, not pertaining to the letter of the law, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit. For they cannot have been without the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who were able to foresee and foretell the revelation thereof that should be in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, inasmuch as even those old <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> were significants of those that should be. Had the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> alone this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and not the people too? Nay indeed, but even they that faithfully heard the Prophets, were aided by the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in order that they might understand what they heard. But without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> was veiled in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, which in the fullness of time should be unveiled in the New.  <q>For,</q> says the Apostle, <q>they did drink of the Spiritual Rock following them, but the Rock was Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183527"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> In a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> therefore theirs was the same meat and drink as ours, but in signification the same, not in form;  because the same Christ was Himself figured to them in a Rock, manifested to us in the Flesh. <q>But,</q> he says, <q>not in all of them God was well pleased.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183529"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:5</a></span> All indeed ate the same spiritual meat and drank the same spiritual drink, that is to say, signifying something spiritual: but not in all of them was God well pleased. When, he says, <q>not in all:</q> there were evidently there some in whom was God well pleased; and although all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> were common, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a>, was not common to all. Just as in our times, now that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been revealed, which then was veiled, to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> that have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note183530"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> the Laver of regeneration is common; but the very <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> whereof these same are the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a>, whereby the members of the Body of Christ are to reign  together with their Head, is not common to all. For even <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have the same Baptism, and false brethren too, in the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> name.</p>

<p>3. Nevertheless, neither then nor now without profit is the voice of him, saying, <q>Hearken ye, My people, to My law.</q> Which expression is remarkable in all the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, how he says not, <q>hearken thou,</q> but, <q>hearken ye.</q> For of many men a people does consist: to which many that which follows is spoken in the plural number. <q>Incline ye your ear unto the words of My mouth.</q> <q>Hearken ye,</q> is the same as, <q>Incline your ear:</q> and what He says there, <q>My law,</q> this He says here in, <q>the words of My mouth.</q> For that man does godly hearken to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the words of His mouth, whose ear humility does incline: not he whose neck <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> does lift up. For whatever is poured in is received on the concave surface of humility, is shaken off from the convexity of swelling. Whence in another place, <q>Incline,</q> he says, <q>your ear, and receive the words of understanding.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183532"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;5:1</a></span> We have been therefore sufficiently admonished to receive even this Psalm of this understanding of Asaph,  to receive, I say, with inclined ear, that is, with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. And it has not been spoken of as being of Asaph himself, but to Asaph himself. Which thing is evident by the Greek article, and is found in certain Latin copies. These words therefore are of understanding, that is, of intelligence, which has been given to Asaph himself: which we had better understand not as to one man, but as to the congregation of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whence we ought by no means to alienate ourselves. For although properly we say <q>Synagogue</q> of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but <q>Church</q> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, because a <q>Congregation</q>  is wont to be understood as rather of beasts, but a <q>convocation</q> as rather of men: yet that too we find called a Church, and it perhaps is more suitable for us  to say, <q>Save us, O Lord, our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and congregate us from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, in order that we may confess to Your Holy Name.</q>  Neither ought we to disdain to be, nay we ought to render ineffable thanks, for that we are, the sheep of His hands, which He foresaw when He was saying, <q>I have other sheep which are not of this fold, them too I must lead in, that there may be one flock and one Shepherd:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183537"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;10:16</a></span> that is to say, by joining the faithful people of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> with the faithful people of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, concerning whom He had before said, <q>I have not been sent but to the sheep which have strayed of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183538"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;15:24</a></span> For also there shall be congregated before Him all nations, and He shall sever them as a shepherd the sheep from the goats. <span class="stiki" id="note183539"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;25:32</a></span> Thus then let us hear that which has been spoken. <q>Hearken ye, My people, to My law, incline ye your ear unto the words of My mouth:</q> not as if addressed to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but rather as if addressed to ourselves, or at least as if these words were said as well to ourselves (as to them ). For when the Apostle had said, <q>But not in all them was God well pleased,</q> thereby showing that there were those too in whom God was well pleased: he has immediately added, <q>For they were overthrown in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>:</q>  secondly he has continued, <q>but these things have been made our figures.</q>...To us therefore more particularly these words have been sung. Whence in this Psalm among other things there has been said, <q>That another generation may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, sons who shall be born and shall arise.</q>  Moreover, if that death by serpents, and that destruction by the destroyer, and the slaying by the sword, were figures, as the Apostle evidently does declare, inasmuch as it is manifest that all those things did happen: for he says not, in a figure they were spoken, or, in a figure they were written, but, in a figure, he says, they happened to them: with how much greater diligence of godliness must those punishments be shunned whereof those were the figures? For beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as in <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things there is much more of good in that which is signified by the figure, than in the figure itself: so also in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things very far worse are the things which are signified by the figures, while so great are the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things which as figures do signify. For as the land of promise, whereunto that people was being led, is nothing in comparison with the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, whereunto the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people is being led: so also those punishments which were figures, though they were so severe, are nothing in comparison with the punishments which they signify. But those which the Apostle has called figures, the same this Psalm, as far as we are able to judge, calls <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and propositions: not having their end in the fact of their having happened, but in those things whereunto they are referred by a reasonable comparison. Let us therefore hearken unto the law of God&mdash; us His people&mdash; and let us incline our ear unto the words of His mouth.</p>

<p>4. <q>I will open,</q> he says, <q>in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> My mouth, I will declare propositions from the beginning</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse2">Psalm 77:2</a></span>. From what beginning he means, is very evident in the words following. For it is not from the beginning, what time the <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and earth were made, nor what time <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> was created in the first man: but what time the congregation that was led out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; in order that the sense may belong to Asaph, which is interpreted a congregation. But O that He that has said, <q>I will open in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> My mouth,</q> would also vouchsafe to open our understanding unto them! For if, as He has opened His mouth in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, He would in like sort open the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> themselves: and as He declares <q>propositions,</q> He would declare in like sort the expositions thereof, we should not be here toiling: but now so hidden and closed are all things, that even if we are able by His aid to arrive at anything, whereon we may feed to our health, still we must eat the bread in the sweat of our face; and pay the penalty of the ancient sentence <span class="stiki" id="note183543"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> not with the labour of the body only, but also with that of the heart. Let him speak then, and let us hear the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and propositions.</p>

<p>5. <q>How great things we have heard, and have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> them, and our fathers have told them to us</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse3">Psalm 77:3</a></span>. The Lord was speaking higher up. For of what other person could these words be thought to be, <q>Hearken ye, O My people, to My law</q>?  Why is it then that now on a sudden a man is speaking, for here we have the words of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <q>our fathers have told them to us.</q> Without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, now about to speak by a man's ministry, as the Apostle says, <q>Will ye to receive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Him that is speaking in me, Christ?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183545"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> in His own person at first willed the words to be uttered, lest a man speaking His words should be despised as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For it is thus with the sayings of God which make their way to us through our bodily sense. The Creator moves the subject creature by an invisible working; not so that the substance is changed into anything corporal and temporal, when by means of corporal and temporal signs, whether belonging to the eyes or to the ears, as far as men are able to receive it, He would make His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For if an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> is able to use air, mist, cloud, fire, and any other natural substance or corporal species;  and man to use face, tongue, hand, pen, letters, or any other significants, for the purpose of intimating the secret things of his own mind: in a word, if, though he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he sends <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> messengers, and he says to one, <q>Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to his servant, Do this, and he does it;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183547"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;7:8</a></span> with how much greater and more effectual power does <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom as Lord all things together are subject, use both the same <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and man, in order that He may declare whatsoever pleases Him?...For those things were heard in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the New: heard when they were being prophesied, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when they were being fulfilled. Where a promise is performed, hearing is not deceived. <q>And our fathers,</q> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the Prophets, <q>have told unto us.</q></p>

<p>6. <q>They have not been hidden from their sons in another generation</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse4">Psalm 77:4</a></span>. This is our generation wherein there has been given to us regeneration. <q>Telling forth the praises of the Lord and His powers, and His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> which He has done.</q> The order of the words is, <q>and our fathers have told unto us, telling forth the praises of the Lord.</q> The Lord is praised, in order that He may be loved. For what object can be loved more to our health? <q>And He has raised up a testimony in Jacob, and has set a law in Jacob</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse5">Psalm 77:5</a></span>. This is the beginning whereof has been spoken above, <q>I will declare propositions from the beginning.</q>  So then the beginning is the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the end is the New. For <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> does prevail in the law.  <q>But the end of the law is Christ for righteousness to every one believing;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183550"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> at whose bestowing <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is shed abroad in our hearts through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which has been given to us:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183551"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> made perfect does cast out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note183552"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> inasmuch as now without the Law the righteousness of God has been made manifest. But inasmuch as He has a testimony by the Law and the Prophets, <span class="stiki" id="note183553"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;3:21</a></span> therefore, <q>He has raised up a testimony in Jacob.</q> For even that Tabernacle which was set up with a work so remarkable and full of such wondrous meanings, is named the Tabernacle of Testimony, wherein was the veil over the Ark of the Law, like the veil over the face of the Minister of the Law;  because in that dispensation there were <q><a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and propositions.</q> For those things which were being preached and were coining to pass were hidden in veiled meanings, and were not seen in unveiled manifestations. But <q>when you shall have passed over unto Christ,</q> says the Apostle, <q>the veil shall be taken away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183555"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> For <q>all the promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Him are yea, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183556"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:20</a></span> Whosoever therefore does cleave to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has the whole of the good which even in the letters of the Law he perceives not: but whosoever is an alien from Christ, does neither perceive, nor has. <q>He has set a law in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> After his usual custom he is making a repetition. For <q>He has raised up a testimony,</q> is the same as, <q>He has set a law,</q> and <q>in Jacob,</q> is the same as <q>in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> For as these are two names of one man, so law and testimony are two names of one thing. Is there any difference, says some one, between <q>has raised up</q> and <q>has set</q>? Yea indeed, the same difference as there is between <q>Jacob</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>:</q> not because they were two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but these same two names were bestowed upon one man for different reasons; Jacob because of supplanting, for that he grasped the foot of his brother at his birth: <span class="stiki" id="note183557"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;25:26</a></span> but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> because of the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note183558"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;32:28</a></span> So <q>raised up</q> is one thing, <q>set</q> is another. For, <q>He has raised up a testimony,</q> as far as I can judge, has been said because by it something has been raised up; <q>For without the Law,</q> says the Apostle, <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was dead: but I lived sometime without the Law: but at the coming in of the commandment <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> revived.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183559"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;7:8-9</a></span> Behold that which has been raised up by the testimony, which is the Law, so that what was lying hidden might appear, as he says a little afterwards: <q>But <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that it might appear <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, through a good thing has wrought in me death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183560"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;7:13</a></span> But <q>He has set a law,</q> has been said, as though it were a yoke upon sinners, whence has been said, <q>For upon a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man law has not been imposed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183561"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:9</a></span> It is a testimony then, so far forth as it does prove anything; but a law so far forth as it does command; though it is one and the same thing. Wherefore just as Christ is a stone, but to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> for the Head of the corner, while to unbelievers a stone of offense and a rock of scandal;  so the testimony of the Law to them that use not the Law lawfully, <span class="stiki" id="note183563"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:8</a></span> is a testimony whereby sinners are to be convicted as deserving of punishment; but to them that use the same lawfully, is a testimony whereby sinners are shown unto whom they ought to flee in order to be delivered....</p>

<p>7. <q>How great things,</q> he says, <q>He has commanded our fathers, to make the same <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to their sons?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse5">Psalm 77:5</a></span>. <q>That another generation may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, sons who shall be born and shall rise up, and they may tell to their sons</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse6">Psalm 77:6</a></span>. <q>That they may put their hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and may not forget the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and may seek out His commandments</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse7">Psalm 77:7</a></span>. <q>That they may not become, like their fathers, a crooked and embittering generation: a generation that has not guided their heart, and the spirit thereof has not been trusted with God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse8">Psalm 77:8</a></span>. These words do point out two peoples as it were, the one belonging to the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, the other to the New: for in that he says, he has implied that they received the commandments, <q>to make them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to their sons,</q> but that they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or do them: but they received them themselves, to the end <q>that another generation might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> what the former <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not. <q>Sons who shall be born and shall arise.</q> For they that have been born have not arisen: because they had not their heart above, but rather on the earth. For the arising is with Christ: whence has been said, <q>If you have arisen with Christ, savour ye the things which are above.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183564"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse1">Colossians&nbsp;3:1</a></span> <q>And they may tell them,</q> he says, <q>to their sons, in order that they may put their hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>...<q>And may not forget the works of God:</q> that is to say, in magnifying and vaunting their own works, as though they did them themselves; while <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> it is that works,</q> in them that work <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, <q>both to will and to work according to good will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183565"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> <q>And may search out His commandments.</q>...The commandments which He has commanded. How then should they still search out, whereas they have already learned them, save that by putting their hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they do then search out His commandments, in order that by them, with His aid, they may be fulfilled? And he says why, by immediately subjoining, <q>and its spirit has not been trusted with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> that is, because it had no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which does obtain what the Law does enjoin. For when the spirit of man does work together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> working, then there is fulfilled that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has commanded: and this does not come to pass, except by believing in Him that does justify an ungodly man. <span class="stiki" id="note183566"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> Which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the generation crooked and embittering had not: and therefore concerning the same has been said, <q>The spirit thereof has not been trusted with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For this has been said much more exactly to point out the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which does work not only remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also does make the spirit of man to work together therewith in the work of good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as though he were saying, his spirit has not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For to have the spirit trusted with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is, not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that his spirit is able to do righteousness without <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God: which is surely more than to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> God. For ofttimes we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> even a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, though in him we must not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. To <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God therefore is this, in believing to cleave unto God who works good works, in order to work with Him well....</p>

<p>8. Lastly, <q>The sons of Ephrem bending and shooting bows, have been turned back in the day of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse9">Psalm 77:9</a></span>. Following after the law of righteousness, unto the law of righteousness they have not attained. <span class="stiki" id="note183567"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse31">Romans&nbsp;9:31</a></span> Why? Because they were not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For they were that generation whereof the spirit has not been trusted with God: but they were, so to speak, of works: because they did not, as they bended and shot their bows (which are outward actions, as of the works of the law), so guide their heart also, wherein the just man does live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; whereby men cleave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who works in man both to will and work according to good will.  For what else is bending the bow and shooting, and turning back in the day of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but heeding and purposing in the day of hearing, and deserting in the day of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; flourishing arms, so to speak, beforehand, and at the hour of the action refusing to fight? But whereas he says, <q>bending and shooting bows,</q> when it would seem that he ought to have said, bending bows and shooting arrows....Some Greek copies to be sure are said to have <q>bending and shooting with bows,</q> so that without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> we ought to understand arrows. But whereas by the sons of Ephrem he has willed that there be understood the whole of that embittering generation, it is an expression signifying the whole by a part. And perhaps this part was chosen whereby to signify the whole, because from these men especially some good thing was to have been expected....Although set at the left hand by his father as being the younger, Jacob nevertheless blessed with his right hand, and preferred him before his elder brother with a benediction of hidden meaning. <span class="stiki" id="note183569"><a href="../bible/gen048.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;48:14</a></span> ...For there was being figured how they were to be last that were first, and first were to be they that were last, <span class="stiki" id="note183570"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;20:16</a></span> through the Saviour's coming, concerning whom has been said, <q>He that is coming after me was made before me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183571"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;1:27</a></span> In like manner righteous Abel was preferred before the elder brother; so to Ismael Isaac; so to <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, though born before him, his twin brother Jacob; so also Phares himself preceded even in birth his twin brother, who had first thrust a hand out of the womb, and had begun to be born:  so David was preferred before his elder brother: <span class="stiki" id="note183573"><a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;16:12</a></span> and as the reason why all these <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and others like them preceded, not only of words but also of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, in like manner to the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was preferred the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, for redeeming the which as Abel by Cain, <span class="stiki" id="note183574"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;4:8</a></span> so by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was slain Christ. This thing was prefigured even when Jacob stretching out his hands cross-wise, with his right hand touched Ephrem standing on the left; and set him before Manasse standing on the right, whom he himself touched with the left hand. <span class="stiki" id="note183575"><a href="../bible/gen048.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;48:14</a></span> </p>

<p>9. But what that is which he says, <q>they have been turned back in the day of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>,</q> the following words do teach, wherein he has most clearly explained this: <q>they have not kept,</q> he says, <q>the testament of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in His law they would not walk</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse10">Psalm 77:10</a></span>. Behold what is, <q>they have been turned back in the day of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>:</q> they have not kept the testament of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When they were bending and shooting bows, they did also utter the words of most forward promise, saying, <q>Whatsoever things the Lord our God has spoken we will do, and we will hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183576"><a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse8">Exodus&nbsp;19:8</a></span> <q>They have been turned back in the day of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>:</q> because the promise of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> not hearing but <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> does prove. But he whose spirit has been trusted with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, keeps hold on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is faithful, and <q>does not suffer him to be tempted above that which he is able; but will make with the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> a way of escape also,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183577"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> that he may be able to endure, and may not be turned back in the day of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>....Therefore these men have been thus branded: <q>a generation,</q> he says, <q>which has not directed their heart.</q>  It has not been said, works, but heart. For when the heart is directed, the works are right; but when the heart is not directed, the works are not right, even though they seem to be right. And how the crooked generation has not directed the heart, has sufficiently been shown, when he says, <q>and the spirit thereof has not been trusted with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  For God is right: and therefore by cleaving to the right, as to an immutable rule, the heart of a man can be made right, which in itself was crooked....</p>

<p>10. <q>And they forgat His benefits, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> of Him which He showed to them; before their fathers the wonderful things which He did</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse11">Psalm 77:11</a></span>. What this is, is not a question to be negligently passed over. Concerning those very fathers he was speaking a little before, that they had been a generation crooked and embittering....What fathers, inasmuch as these are the very fathers, whom he would not have posterity to be like? If we shall take them to be those out of whom the others had derived their being, for example, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, Jacob, by this time they had long since fallen asleep, when God showed wonderful things in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. For there follows, <q>in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in the plain of Thanis</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse12">Psalm 77:12</a></span>: where it is said that God showed to them wonderful things before their fathers. Were they perchance present in spirit? For of the same the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>for all do live to Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183580"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;20:38</a></span> Or do we more suitably understand thereby the fathers <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and the other elders who are related in the same Scripture also to have received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, of which also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> received, in order that they might aid him in ruling and bearing the same people? <span class="stiki" id="note183581"><a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse17">Numbers&nbsp;11:17</a></span> For why should they not have been called fathers? It is not in the same manner as God is the One Father, who does regenerate with His Spirit those whom He does make sons for an everlasting inheritance; but it is for the sake of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, because of their age and kindly carefulness: just as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the elder says, <q>Not to confound you I am writing these things, but as my dearly beloved sons I am admonishing you:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183582"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:14</a></span> though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that it had been said by the Lord, <q>Call ye no man your father on earth, for One is your Father, even God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183583"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;23:9</a></span> And this was not said in order that this term of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> should be erased from our usual way of speaking: but lest the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God whereby we are regenerated unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, should be ascribed either to the power or even <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of any man. Therefore when he said, <q>I have begotten you;</q> he first said, <q>in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> and <q>through the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>;</q> lest that might be thought to be of him, which is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>....Accordingly, the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> must be understood for a figure of this world. <q>The plain of Thanis</q> is the smooth surface of lowly commandment. For lowly commandment is the interpretation of Thanis. In this world therefore let us receive the commandment of humility, in order that in another world we may merit to receive the exaltation which He has promised, who for our sake here became lowly.</p>

<p>11. For He that <q>did burst asunder the sea and made them go through, did confine the waters as it were in bottles</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse13">Psalm 77:13</a></span>, in order that the water might stand up first as if it were shut in, is able by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to restrain the flowing and ebbing tides of carnal desires, when we renounce this world, so that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> having been thoroughly washed away, as if they were enemies, the people of the faithful may be made to pass through by means of the Sacrament of Baptism. He that <q>led them home in the cloud of the day, and in the whole of the night in the illumination of fire</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse14">Psalm 77:14</a></span>, is able also spiritually to direct goings if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> cries to Him, <q>Direct      my goings after Your word.</q>  Of Whom in another place  is said, <q>For Himself shall make your courses right, and shall prolong your goings in peace</q>  through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, whose Sacrament in this world, as it were in the day, is manifest in the flesh, as if in a cloud; but in the Judgment it will be manifest like as in a terror by night; for then there will be a great tribulation of the world like as it were fire, and it shall shine for the just and shall burn for the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. <q>He that burst asunder the rock in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and gave them water as in a great deep</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse15">Psalm 77:15</a></span>; <q>and brought out water from the rock, and brought down waters like rivers</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse16">Psalm 77:16</a></span>, is surely able upon thirsty <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to pour the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> (the which gift the performance of that thing did spiritually signify), to pour, I say, from the Spiritual Rock that followed, which is Christ: who stood and cried, <q>If any is thirsty, let him come to Me:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183587"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37</a></span> and, <q>he that shall have drunk of the water which I shall give, rivers of living water shall flow out of his bosom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183588"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span> For this He spoke, as is read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note183589"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;7:39</a></span> to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which they were to receive that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him, unto whom like the rod drew near the wood of the Passion, in order that there might flow forth <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>.</p>

<p>12. And yet, <q>they,</q> like a generation crooked and embittering, <q>added yet to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against Him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse17">Psalm 77:17</a></span>: that is, not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For this is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whereof the Spirit does convict the world, as the Lord says, <q>Of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> indeed because they have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183590"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;16:9</a></span> <q>And they exasperated the Most High in drought,</q> which other copies have, <q>in a place without water,</q> which is a more exact translation from the Greek, and does signify no other thing than drought. Was it in that drought of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, or rather in their own? For although they had drank of the rock, they had not their bellies but their minds dry, freshening with no fruitfulness of righteousness. In that drought they ought the more faithfully to have been suppliant unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that He who had given fullness unto their jaws, might give also equity to their manners. For unto him the faithful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does cry, <q>Let my eyes see equity.</q> </p>

<p>13. <q>And they tempted God in their hearts, in order that they might seek morsels for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse18">Psalm 77:18</a></span>. It is one thing to ask in believing, another thing in tempting. Lastly there follows, <q>And they <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said, Shall God be able to prepare a table in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse19">Psalm 77:19</a></span>. <q>For He smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and torrents gushed forth: will He be able to give bread also, or to prepare a table for His people?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse20">Psalm 77:20</a></span>. Not believing therefore, they sought morsels for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Not so the Apostle James does enjoin a morsel to be asked for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but does admonish that it be sought by <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, not by such as tempt and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> God. <q>But if any one of you,</q> he says, <q>does lack wisdom, let him ask of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who does give to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> abundantly, and does not upbraid, and it shall be given to him: but let him ask in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nothing wavering.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183592"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse5">James&nbsp;1:5-6</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had not that generation which <q>had not directed their heart, and the spirit thereof had not been trusted with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>14. <q>Wherefore the Lord heard, and He delayed, and fire was lighted in Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> went up into <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse21">Psalm 77:21</a></span>. He has explained what he has called fire. He has called <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> fire: although in strict propriety fire did also burn up many men. What is therefore this that he says, <q>The Lord heard, and He delayed</q>? Did He delay to conduct them into the land of promise, whither they were being led: which might have been done in the space of a few days, but on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they must needs be wasted in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, where also they were wasted during forty years? And if this be so, He did then delay the people, not those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who tempted and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> God: for they all perished in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and their children journeyed into the land of promise. Or did He delay punishment, in order that He might first satisfy unbelieving concupiscence, lest He might be supposed to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, because they were asking of Him what He was not able to do? <q>He heard,</q> then, <q>and He delayed to avenge:</q> and after He had done what they supposed He was not able to do, then <q><a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> went up upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q></p>

<p>15. Lastly, when both these things have been briefly touched, afterwards he is evidently following out the order of the narrative. <q>Because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor hoped in His saving health</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse22">Psalm 77:22</a></span>. For when he had told why fire was lighted in Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> went up upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that is to say, <q>because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor hoped in His saving health:</q> immediately subjoining the evident blessings for which they were ungrateful, he says, <q>and He commanded the clouds above, and opened the doors of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse23">Psalm 77:23</a></span>. <q>And He rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them bread of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse24">Psalm 77:24</a></span>. <q>Bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> man did eat: dainties He sent them in abundance</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse25">Psalm 77:25</a></span>. He brought over the South Wind from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and in His <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> He led in the South West Wind <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse26">Psalm 77:26</a></span>. <q>And He rained upon them fleshes like dust, and winged fowls like the sand of the sea</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse27">Psalm 77:27</a></span>. <q>And they fell in the midst of their camp, around their tabernacles</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse28">Psalm 77:28</a></span>. <q>And they ate and were filled exceedingly; and their desire He brought to them: they were not deprived of their desire</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse29">Psalm 77:29</a></span>. Behold why He had delayed. But what He had delayed let us hear. <q>Yet the morsel was in their mouths, and the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God came down upon them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse30">Psalm 77:30</a></span>. Behold what He had delayed. For before <q>He delayed:</q> and afterwards, <q>fire was lighted in Jacob and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> went up upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> He had delayed therefore in order that He might first do what they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He could not do, and then might bring upon them what they deserved to suffer. For if they placed their hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only would their desires of the flesh but also those of the spirit have been fulfilled. For he that...<q>opened the doors of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and rained upon them manna to eat,</q> that He might fill the unbelieving, is not without power to give to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> Himself the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Bread from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, which the manna did signify: which is indeed the food of Angels, whom being incorruptible the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> does incorruptibly feed: the which in order that man might eat, He became flesh, and dwelled in us. <span class="stiki" id="note183593"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;1:44</a></span> For Himself the Bread by means of the Evangelical clouds is being rained over the whole world, and, the hearts of preachers like heavenly doors, being opened, is being preached not to a murmuring and tempting <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, but to a Church believing and putting hope in Him. He is able also to feed the feeble <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of such as tempt not, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, with the signs of words uttered by the flesh and speeding through the air, as though it were fowls: not however with such as come from the north, where cold and mist do prevail, that is to say, eloquence which is pleasing to this world, but by bringing over the South Wind from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; whither, except to the earth? In order that they who are feeble in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by hearing things earthly may be nourished up to receive things heavenly....</p>

<p>16. But as to unbelievers, being a crooked and embittering generation, as it were, while the morsel was yet in their mouths, <q>the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God went up upon them, and it slew among the most of them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse31">Psalm 77:31</a></span>: that is, the most of them, or as some copies have it, <q>the fat ones of them,</q> which however in the Greek copies which we had, we did not find. But if this be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> reading, what else must be understood by <q>the fat ones of them,</q> than men mighty in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, concerning whom is said, <q>their iniquity shall come forth as if out of fat</q>?  <q>And the elect of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> He fettered.</q> Even there there were elect, with whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the generation crooked and embittering was not mixed. But they were fettered, so that they might in no sort profit them for whom they desired that they might provide from a fatherly affection. For what is conferred by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mercy, on those with whom God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>? Or rather has He willed it to be understood, how that even the elect were fettered at the same time with them, in order that they who were diverse both in mind and in life, might endure sufferings with them for an example not only of righteousness, but also of patience? For we have learned that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men were even led captive with sinners for no other reason; since in the Greek copies we read not <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;</span>, which is <q>fettered;</q> but <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;</span>, which is rather <q>fettered together with.</q></p>

<p>17. But the generation crooked and embittering, <q>in all these things <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> yet more, and they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse32">Psalm 77:32</a></span>. <q>And in their days failed in vanity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse33">Psalm 77:33</a></span>. Though they might, if they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, have had days in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> without failing, with Him to whom has been said, <q>Your years shall not fail.</q>  Therefore, <q>their days failed in vanity, and their years with haste.</q> For the whole life of mortal men is hastening, and that which seems to be longer is but a vapour of somewhat longer duration.</p>

<p>18. Nevertheless, <q>when he slew them they sought Him:</q> not for the sake of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, but fearing to end the vapour too soon. There sought Him then, not indeed those whom He had slain, but they that were afraid of being slain according to the example of them. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has so spoken of them as if they sought God who were slain; because they were one people, and it is spoken as if of one body: <q>and they returned, and at dawn they came to God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse34">Psalm 77:34</a></span>. <q>And they remembered that God is their Helper, and the High God is their Redeemer</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse35">Psalm 77:35</a></span>. But all this is for the sake of acquiring temporal <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and for avoiding temporal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. For they that did seek God for the sake of temporal blessings, sought not God indeed, but things. Thus with those God is worshipped with slavish <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, not free <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Thus then God is not worshipped, for that thing is worshipped which is loved. Whence because God is found to be greater and better than all things, He must be loved more than all things, in order that He may be worshipped.</p>

<p>19. Lastly, here let us see the words following: <q>And they loved Him,</q> he says, <q>in their mouth, and in their tongue they lied unto Him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse36">Psalm 77:36</a></span>. <q>But their heart was not right with Him, and they were not counted faithful in His Testament</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse37">Psalm 77:37</a></span>. One thing on their tongue, another thing in their heart He found, unto whom the secret things of men are naked, and without any impediment He saw what they loved rather. Therefore the heart is right with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when it does seek God for the sake of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For one thing he desired of the Lord, the same he will require, that he may dwell always in the House of the Lord, and may meditate on the pleasantness of Him.  Unto Whom says the heart of the faithful, I will be filled, not with the flesh-pots of the Egyptians, nor with melons and gourds, and garlick and onions, which a generation crooked and embittering did prefer even to bread celestial, <span class="stiki" id="note183597"><a href="../bible/exo016.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;16:3</a></span> nor with visible manna, and those same winged fowls; but, <q>I will be filled, when Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall be made manifest.</q>  For this is the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, wherein they were not counted faithful; whereof however the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even at that time, when it was veiled, was in the <a href="../cathen/05374a.htm">elect</a>, and now, when it has already been revealed, it is not in many that are called. <q>For many have been called, but few are elect.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183599"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;20:16</a></span> Of such sort therefore was the generation crooked and embittering, even when they were seeming to seek <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, loving in mouth, and in tongue lying; but in heart not right with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while they loved rather those things, for the sake of which they required the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>20. <q>But He is Himself merciful, and will become propitious to their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and He will not destroy them. And He will abound to turn away His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and He will not kindle all his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse38">Psalm 77:38</a></span>. By these words many men promise to themselves impunity for their iniquity from the Divine Mercy, even if they shall have persevered in being such, as that generation is described, <q>crooked and embittering; which has not directed their heart, and the spirit thereof has not been trusted with God:</q> with whom it is not profitable to agree. For if, to speak in their words, God will perchance not destroy no not even bad men, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> He will not destroy good men. Why then do we not rather choose that wherein there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>? For they that lie to Him in their tongue, though their heart does hold some other thing, do think indeed, and will, even God to be a liar, when He does menace upon such men <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. But while they do not deceive Him with their lying, He does not deceive them with speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. These words therefore of divine sayings, concerning which the crooked generation does cajole itself, let it not make crooked like its own heart: for even when it is made crooked, they continue right. For at first they may be understood according to that which is written in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>that you may be like your Father who is in the Heavens, who makes His sun to rise upon good men and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, and rains upon just men and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183600"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> For who could not see, how great is the long-suffering of mercy with which He is sparing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men? But before the Judgment, He spared then that nation in such sort, that He kindled not all His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, utterly to root it up and bring it to an end: which thing in His words and in the intercession for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of His servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> does evidently appear, where God says, <q>Let Me blot them out, and make you into a great nation:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183602"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;32:10</a></span> he intercedes, being more ready to be blotted out for them than that they should be; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he is doing this before One Merciful, who inasmuch as by no means He would blot out him, would even spare them for his sake. For let us see how greatly He spared, and does still spare....</p>

<p>21. In the second place, that we may not seem to do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to divine words, and lest in the place where there was said, <q>He will not destroy them,</q>  we should say, <q>But hereafter He will destroy them:</q> concerning this very present Psalm let us turn to a very common phrase of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, whereby this question may be more diligently and more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> solved. Speaking of these same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> a little lower down, when He had made mention of the things which the Egyptians because of them had endured, He says,...<q>And He led them unto the mount of His sanctification, the mount which His right hand won. And He cast out from their face the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and by lot distributed to them the land in the cord of distribution.</q>  If any one at these words should press a question upon us, and should say, How does he make mention of all these things as having been bestowed upon them, when the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were not led into the land of promise, as were delivered from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, inasmuch as they were dead? What shall we reply but that they were spoken of, because they were the self-same people by means of a succession of sons?...</p>

<p>22. <q>And He remembered that they are flesh, a spirit  going and not returning</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse39">Psalm 77:39</a></span>. Therefore calling them and pitying them through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He called them back Himself, because of themselves they could not return. For how does flesh return, <q>a spirit walking and not turning back,</q>  while a weight of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> deserts does weigh it down unto the lowest and far places of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, save through the election of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?...For thus also is solved this no unimportant question, how it is written in the Proverbs, when the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> was speaking of the way of iniquity, <q>all they that walk in her shall not return.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183607"><a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;2:19</a></span> For it has been so spoken as if all ungodly men were to be despaired of: but the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> did only commend <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for of himself man is able to walk in that way, but is not able of himself to return, except when called back by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>23. I say then of these crooked and embittering <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, <q>How often they exasperated Him in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and provoked Him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> in the waterless place!</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse40">Psalm 77:40</a></span>. <q>And they turned themselves and tempted <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and exasperated the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse41">Psalm 77:41</a></span>. He is repeating that same unbelief of theirs, of which He had made mention above. But the reason of the repetition is, in order that there may be mentioned also the plagues which He inflicted on the Egyptians for their sakes: all which things they certainly ought to have remembered, and not to be ungrateful. Lastly, there follows what? <q>They remembered not His hands, in the day when He redeemed them from the hand of the troubler</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse42">Psalm 77:42</a></span>. And he begins to speak of what things He did to the Egyptians: <q>He set in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> His signs, and His prodigies in the plain of Thanis</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse43">Psalm 77:43</a></span>: <q>and He turned their rivers into blood, and their showers lest they should drink</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse44">Psalm 77:44</a></span>, or rather, <q>the flowings of waters,</q> as some do better understand by what is written in Greek, <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1F40;&#x03BC;&#x03B2;&#x03C1;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>, which in Latin we call <em> scaturigines</em>, waters bubbling from beneath. <q>He sent upon them the dog-fly, and it ate them up; and the frog, and it destroyed them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse45">Psalm 77:45</a></span>. <q>And He gave their fruit to the mildew, and their labours to the locust</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse46">Psalm 77:46</a></span>. <q>And He slew with hail their vineyards, and their mulberry trees with frost</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse47">Psalm 77:47</a></span>. <q>And He gave over to the hail their beasts of burden, and their possessions to the fire</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse48">Psalm 77:48</a></span>. <q>He sent upon them the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of His indignation, indignation and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and tribulation, a visitation through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse49">Psalm 77:49</a></span>. He made a way to the course of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and their beasts of burden He shut up in death <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse50">Psalm 77:50</a></span>. <q>And He smote every <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> thing in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of their labours in the tabernacles of Cham</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse51">Psalm 77:51</a></span>.</p>

<p>24. All these punishments of the Egyptians may be explained by an allegorical interpretation, according as one shall have chosen to understand them, and to compare them to the things whereunto they must be referred. Which we too will endeavour to do; and shall do it the more properly, the more we shall have been divinely aided. For to do this, those words of this Psalm do constrain us, wherein it was said, <q>I will open in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> my mouth, I will declare propositions from the beginning.</q>  For for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> even some things have been here spoken of, which that they befell the Egyptians at all we read not, although all their plagues are most carefully related in Exodus according to their order, so that while that which is not there mentioned we are sure has not been mentioned in the Psalm to no purpose, and we can interpret the same only figuratively, we may at the same time understand that even the rest of the things which it is evident did happen, were done or described for the sake of some figurative meaning. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> does so do in many passages of the prophetic sayings....In the plagues therefore of the Egyptians, which are in the book which is called Exodus, where the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has been especially careful, that those things whereby they were afflicted should be all related in order, there is not found what this Psalm has, <q>and He gave to the mildew their fruits.</q> This also wherein, when he had said, <q>and He gave over to the hail their beasts,</q> he has added, <q>and their possession to the fire:</q> of the beasts slain with hail is read in Exodus; <span class="stiki" id="note183609"><a href="../bible/exo009.htm#verse25">Exodus&nbsp;9:25</a></span> but how their possession was burned with fire, is not read at all. Although voices and fires do come together with hail, just as thunderings do commonly accompany lightnings; nevertheless, it is not written that anything was given over to the fire that it should be burned. Lastly, the soft things which the hail could not hurt, are said not to have been smitten, that is, hurt with hard blows; which things the locust devoured afterwards. Also that which is here spoken of, <q>and their mulberry trees with hoar-frost,</q> is not in Exodus. For hoar-frost does differ much from hail; for in the clear winter nights the earth is made white with hoar-frost.</p>

<p>25. What then those things do signify, let the interpreter say as he can, let reader and hearer judge as is just. The water turned into blood seems to me to signify a carnal view of the causes of things. Dog-fly, are the manners of dogs,  who see not even their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> when first they are born. The frog is very talkative vanity. Mildew does hurt secretly, which also some have interpreted by rust, others black mould: which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing to what <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is it more appropriately compared, than to what does show itself least readily, like the trusting much in one's self? For it is a blighting air which does work this secretly among fruits: just like in morals, secret <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, when a man thinks himself to be something, though he is nothing. <span class="stiki" id="note183611"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse3">Galatians&nbsp;6:3</a></span> The locust is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> hurting with the mouth, that is, with unfaithful testimony. The hail is iniquity taking away the goods of others; whence theft, robberies, and depredations do spring: but more by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> the plunderer himself is plundered. The hoar-frost does signify the fault wherein the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of one's neighbour by the darkness of foolishness, like as it were by the cold of night, is frozen up. But the fire, if here it is not that which is mentioned which was in the hail out of the lightning clouds, forasmuch as he has said here, <q>He gave over their possession to the fire,</q> where he implies that a thing was burned, which by that fire we read not to have been done&mdash;it seems to me, I say, to signify the savageness of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, whereby even man-slaying may be committed. But by the death of beasts was figured, as far as I judge, the loss of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For concupiscence, whereby offspring do arise, we have in common with beasts. To have this therefore tamed and ordered, is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. The death of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> things, is the putting off of the very <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> whereby a man does associate with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. But whether the figurative significations of these things be so, or whether they are better understood in another way, whom would it not move, that with ten plagues the Egyptians are smitten, and with ten commandments the tables are inscribed,  that thereby the people of God should be ruled? Concerning the comparing of which one with the other, inasmuch as we have spoken elsewhere, there is no need to load the exposition of this Psalm therewith: thus much we remind you, that here too, though not in the same order, yet ten plagues of the Egyptians are commemorated, forasmuch as in the place of three which are in Exodus and are not here, to wit, lice, boils, darkness; other three are commemorated, which are not there, that is to say, mildew, hoarfrost, and fire; not of lightning, but that where-unto their possession was given over, which is not read of in that place.</p>

<p>26. But it has been clearly enough intimated, that by the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> these things befell them through the instrumentality of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, in this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> world, as though it were in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and in the plain of Thanis, where we ought to be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, until there come that world, wherein we may earn to be exalted out of this humiliation. For even <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in the Hebrew tongue does signify darkness or tribulations, in which tongue, Thanis,  as I have observed, is understood to be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> commandment. Concerning the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> therefore in this Psalm, while he was speaking of those very plagues, there has been something inserted, which must not be passed over cursorily: <q>He sent upon them,</q> he says, <q>an infliction through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> Now that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are so very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that for them <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a> is prepared, no believer is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>: but that there should be sent by means of them an infliction from the Lord God upon certain whom He judges to be deserving of this punishment, seems to be a hard thing to those who are little prone to consider, how the perfect <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of God does use well even <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. For these indeed, as far as regards their substance, what other person but Himself has made? But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> He has not made them: yet He does use them, inasmuch as He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, well, that is, conveniently and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>: just as on the other hand unrighteous men do use His good creatures in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> manner. God therefore does use <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> not only to punish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, as in the case of all those concerning whom the Psalm does speak, as in the case of king Achab, whom a spirit of lying by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God did beguile, in order that he might fall in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note183614"><a href="../bible/1ki022.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;22:20</a></span> but also to prove and make manifest good men, as He did in the case of Job. But as far as regards that corporal matter of visible elements, I suppose that thereof <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> both good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are able to make use, according to the power given to each: just as also men good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> do use such things, as far as they are able, according to the measure of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity. For we use both earth and water, and air, and fire, not only in things necessary for our support, but also in many operations superfluous and playful, and marvellously artificial. For countless things, which are called <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03C7;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>, are moulded out of these elements scientifically employed. But over these things <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have a far more extended power, both the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, though greater is that which the good have;  but only so far as is commanded or permitted by the will and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; on which terms also we have it. For not even in these cases are we able to do all that we will. But in a book the most unerring we read that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was able even to send fire from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, to burn up with wonderful and awful fierceness so great a number of the cattle of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man: <span class="stiki" id="note183616"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse16">Job&nbsp;1:16</a></span> which thing no one of the faithful would dare perchance to ascribe to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, except it were read on the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>. But that man, being by the gift of God just and firm, and of godly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, says not, The Lord has given, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has taken away: but, <q>The Lord has given, the Lord has taken away:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183617"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job&nbsp;1:21</a></span> very well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that even what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was able to do with these elements, he would still not have done to a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except at his Lord's will and permission; he did confound the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, forasmuch as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> who it was that was making use thereof to prove him. In the sons then of unbelief like as it were in his own slaves, he does work, <span class="stiki" id="note183618"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> like men with their beasts, and even therewith only so far as is permitted by the just judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But it is one thing when his power is restrained from treating even his own as he pleases, by a greater power; another thing when to him power is given even over those who are alien from him. Just as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with his beast, as men understand it, does what he will, and yet does not indeed, if he be restrained by a greater power: but with another man's beast to do something, he does wait until power be given from him unto whom it belongs. In the former case the power which there was is restrained, in the latter that which there was not is conceded.</p>

<p>27. And if such be the case, if through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> God did inflict those plagues upon the Egyptians, shall we dare to say that the water also was turned into blood by means of those same <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and that frogs were created by means of the same, the like whereunto even the magicians of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> were able to make by their enchantments; <span class="stiki" id="note183619"><a href="../bible/exo008.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;8:7</a></span> so as that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> stood on both sides, on the one side afflicting them, on the other side deceiving them, according to the judgment and dispensation  of the most just and most <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who does <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> make use of even the naughtiness of unrighteous men? I dare not to say so. For whence was it that the magicians of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> could by no means make lice? <span class="stiki" id="note183621"><a href="../bible/exo008.htm#verse18">Exodus&nbsp;8:18-19</a></span> Was it not because even these same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were not suffered to do this? Or, to speak more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, is not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> hidden, and it does exceed our powers of inquiry? For if we shall have supposed that God wrought those things by means of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, because punishments were being inflicted, and not blessings being bestowed, as though God does inflict punishments upon no one by means of good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but by means of those executioners as it were of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; the consequence will be that we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> was overthrown by means of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> would seem to have entertained under their roof <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>;  the which, as being contrary to the most evident Scriptures, far be it that we should think. It is clear then that these things might have been done to men by means of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. What should be done or when it should be done does escape me: but Him that does it, it escapes not, and him unto whom He shall have willed to reveal it. Nevertheless, as far as <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> does yield to our application thereto, on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men that punishments are inflicted both by means of good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as upon the Sodomites, and by means of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as upon the Egyptians, we read: but that just men with corporal penances by means of good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are tried and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, does not occur to me.</p>

<p>28. But as far as regards the present passage of this Psalm, if we dare not ascribe those things which were marvellously formed out of creatures, to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; we have a thing which without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> we can ascribe to them; the dyings of the beasts, the dyings of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, and this especially whence all these things proceeded, namely, the hardening of heart, so that they would not let go the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note183623"><a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse21">Exodus&nbsp;4:21</a></span> For when God is said to make this most iniquitous and malignant obstinacy, He makes it not by suggesting and inspiring, but by forsaking, so that they work in the sons of unbelief that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> does duly and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> permit. <span class="stiki" id="note183624"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> ...Moreover, those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> manners which we said were signified by these corporal plagues, on account of that which was said before, <q>I will open in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> my mouth,</q>  are most appropriately <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to have been wrought in those that are made subject to them by Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For neither when that comes to pass of which the apostle speaks, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave them over into the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of their heart, that they should do things which are not convenient,</q>  can it be but that those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> dwell and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> therein, as in the matter of their own work: unto whom most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> haughtiness made subject, in all save those whom <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does deliver. <q>And for these things who is sufficient?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183627"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:16</a></span> Whence when he had said, <q>He sent unto them the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of His indignation, indignation and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and tribulation, an infliction through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>;</q> for this which he has added, <q>a way He has made for the path of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse50">Psalm 77:50</a></span>, whose eye, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, is sufficient to penetrate, so that it may understand and take in the sense lying hidden in so great a profundity? For the path of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God was that whereby He punished the ungodliness of the Egyptians with hidden <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: but for that same path He made a way, so that drawing them forth as it were from secret places by means of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> unto manifest offenses, He most evidently inflicted punishment upon those that were most evidently ungodly. From this power of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> nothing does deliver man but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereof the Apostle speaks, <q>Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183628"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> of which things that people did bear the figure, when they were delivered from the power of the Egyptians, and translated into the kingdom of the land of promise flowing with milk and honey, which does signify the sweetness of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>29. The Psalm proceeds then after the commemoration of the plagues of the Egyptians <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse51">Psalm 77:51</a></span> and says, <q>And He took away like sheep His people, and He led them through like a flock in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse52">Psalm 77:52</a></span>. <q>And He led them down in hope, and they feared not, and their enemies the sea covered</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse53">Psalm 77:53</a></span>. This comes to pass to so much the greater good, as it is a more inward thing, wherein being delivered from the power of darkness, we are in mind translated into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">Kingdom of God</a>, and with respect to spiritual pastures we are made to become sheep of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, walking in this world as it were in a desert, inasmuch as to no one is our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> observable: whence says the Apostle, <q>Your life is hidden with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183629"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> But we are being led home in hope, <q>For by hope we are saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183630"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24</a></span> Nor ought we to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For, <q>If God be for us, who can be against us?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183631"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse31">Romans&nbsp;8:31</a></span> And our enemies the sea has covered, He has effaced them in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>30. In the next place there follows, <q>And He led them into the mountain of His sanctification</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse54">Psalm 77:54</a></span>. How much better into Holy Church! <q>The mountain which His right hand has gotten.</q> How much higher is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which Christ has gotten, concerning whom has been said, <q>And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183632"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1</a></span> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse55">Psalm 77:55</a></span>. <q>And He cast forth from the face of them the nations.</q> And  from the face of His faithful. For nations in a manner are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> of Gentile <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. <q>And by lot He divided unto them the land in the cord of distribution.</q> And in us <q>all things one and the same Spirit does work, dividing severally to every one as He wills.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183634"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> </p>

<p>31. <q>And He made to dwell in their tabernacles the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> In the tabernacles, he says, of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> He made the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to dwell, which I think can better be explained spiritually, inasmuch as unto celestial <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, whence sinning <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have been cast forth and cast down, by Christ's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we are being uplifted. For that generation crooked and embittering, inasmuch as for these corporal blessings they put not off the coat of oldness, <q>Did tempt</q> yet, <q>and provoked the high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His testimonies they kept not <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse56">Psalm 77:56</a></span>: and they turned them away, and they kept not the covenant, like their fathers</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse57">Psalm 77:57</a></span>. For under a sort of covenant and decree they said, <q>All things which our Lord God has spoken we will do, and we will hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183635"><a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse8">Exodus&nbsp;19:8</a></span> It is a remarkable  thing indeed which he says, <q>like their fathers:</q> while throughout the whole text of the Psalm he was seeming to speak of the same men as it were, yet now it appears that the words did concern those who were already in the land of promise, and that the fathers spoken of were of those who did provoke in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. <q>They were turned,</q> he says, <q>into a crooked,</q> or, as some copies have it, <q>into a perverse bow</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse58">Psalm 77:58</a></span>. But what this is does better appear in that which follows, where he says, <q>And unto <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> they provoked Him with their hills</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse59">Psalm 77:59</a></span>. It does signify that they leaped into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. The bow then was perverted, not for the name of the Lord, but against the name of the Lord: who said to the same people, <q>You shall have none other Gods but Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183636"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;20:3</a></span> But by the bow He does signify the mind's intention. This same idea, lastly, more clearly working out, <q>And in their graven <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>,</q> he says, <q>they provoked Him to indignation.</q></p>

<p>32. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> heard, and He despised:</q> that is, He gave heed and took vengeance. <q>And unto nothing He brought <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> exceedingly</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse60">Psalm 77:60</a></span>. For when God despised, what were they who by God's help were what they were? But doubtless he is commemorating the doing of that thing, when they were conquered by the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> in the time of Heli the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and the Ark of the Lord was taken, and with great slaughter they were laid low.  This it is that he speaks of. <q>And He rejected the tabernacle of Selom, His tabernacle, where He dwelled among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse61">Psalm 77:61</a></span>. He has elegantly explained why He rejected His tabernacle, when he says, <q>where He dwelled among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> When therefore they were not worthy for Him to dwell among, why should He not reject the tabernacle, which indeed not for Himself He had established, but for their sakes, whom now He judged unworthy for Him to dwell among. <q>And He gave over unto captivity their strength, and their beauty unto the hands of the enemy.</q> The very Ark whereby they thought themselves invincible, and whereon they plumed themselves, he calls their <q><a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a></q> and <q>beauty.</q> Lastly, also afterward, when they were living ill, and boasting of the temple of the Lord, He does terrify them by a Prophet, saying, <q>See ye what I have done to Selom, where was My tabernacle.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183638"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse12">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:12</a></span> <q>And He ended with the sword His people, and His inheritance He despised</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse62">Psalm 77:62</a></span>. <q>Their young men the fire devoured:</q> that is, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. <q>And their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> mourned not</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse63">Psalm 77:63</a></span>. For not even for this was there leisure, in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the foe. <q>Their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> fell by the sword, and their <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> were not lamented</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse64">Psalm 77:64</a></span>. For there fell by the sword the sons of Heli, of one of whom the wife being widowed, and presently dying in child-birth, <span class="stiki" id="note183639"><a href="../bible/1sa004.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;4:19</a></span> because of the same confusion could not be mourned with the distinction of a funeral. <q>And the Lord was awakened as one sleeping</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse65">Psalm 77:65</a></span>. For He seems to sleep, when He gives His people into the hands of those whom He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, when there is said to them, <q>Where is your God?</q>  <q>He was awakened, then, like one sleeping, like a mighty man drunken with wine.</q> No one would dare to say this of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save His Spirit. For he has spoken, as it seems to ungodly men reviling; as if like a drunken man He sleeps long, when He succours not so speedily as men think. </p>

<p>33. <q>And He smote His enemies in the hinder parts</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse66">Psalm 77:66</a></span>: those, to wit, who were rejoicing that they were able to take His Ark: for they were smitten in their back-parts. <span class="stiki" id="note183642"><a href="../bible/1sa005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;5:6</a></span> Which seems to me to be a sign of that punishment, wherewith a man will be tortured, if he shall have looked back upon things behind; which, as says the Apostle, he ought to value as dung. <span class="stiki" id="note183643"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;3:8</a></span> For they that do so receive the Testament of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as that they put not off from them the old vanity, are like the hostile nations, who did place the captured Ark of the Testament beside their own <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. And yet those old things even though these be unwilling do fall: for <q>all flesh is hay, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of man as the flower of hay. The hay has dried up, and the flower has fallen off:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183644"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;40:6-7</a></span> but the Ark of the Lord <q>abides for everlasting,</q> to wit, the secret testament of the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, where is the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. But they that have loved things behind, because of these very things most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> shall be tormented. For <q>everlasting reproach He has given to them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse67">Psalm 77:67</a></span>.</p>

<p>34. <q>And He rejected,</q> he says, <q>the tabernacle of Joseph, and the tribe of Ephraim  He chose not</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse68">Psalm 77:68</a></span>. <q>And He chose the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse69">Psalm 77:69</a></span>. He has not said, He rejected the tabernacle of Reuben, who was the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> son of Jacob; <span class="stiki" id="note183646"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;49:3</a></span> nor them that follow, and precede Judah in order of birth; so that they being rejected and not chosen, the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> was chosen. For it might have been said that they were deservedly rejected; because even in the blessing of Jacob wherewith he blessed his sons, he mentions their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note183647"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;49:5</a></span> and deeply abhors them; though among them the tribe of Levi merited to be the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> tribe, whence also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was. <span class="stiki" id="note183648"><a href="../bible/exo002.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;2:1</a></span> Nor has he said, He rejected the tabernacle of Benjamin, or the tribe of Benjamin He chose not, out of which a king already had begun to be; for thence there had been chosen Saul; <span class="stiki" id="note183649"><a href="../bible/1sa009.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;9:1</a></span> whence because of the very proximity of the time, when he had been rejected and refused, and David chosen, <span class="stiki" id="note183650"><a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;16:1</a></span> this might conveniently have been said; but yet was not said: but he has named those especially who seemed to excel for more surpassing merits. For Joseph fed in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> his father and his brethren, and having been impiously sold, because of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, wisdom, he was most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> exalted; <span class="stiki" id="note183651"><a href="../bible/gen041.htm#verse40">Genesis&nbsp;41:40</a></span> and Ephraim by the blessing of his grandfather Jacob was preferred before his elder brother:  and yet God <q>rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and the tribe of Ephraim He chose not.</q> In which place by these names of renowned merit, what else do we understand but that whole people with old cupidity requiring of the Lord earthly rewards, rejected and refused, but the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> chosen not for the sake of the merits of that same Judah? For far greater are the merits of Joseph, but by the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a>, inasmuch as thence arose Christ according to the flesh, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> does testify of the new people of Christ preferred before that old people, the Lord opening in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> His mouth. Moreover, thence also in that which follows, <q>the Mount Sion which He chose,</q> we do better understand the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not <a href="../cathen/15710a.htm">worshipping</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for the sake of the carnal blessings of the present time, but from afar looking for future and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rewards with the eyes of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for Sion too is interpreted a <q>looking out.</q></p>

<p>35. Lastly there follows, <q>and He built like as of unicorns His sanctification</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse70">Psalm 77:70</a></span>: or, as some interpreters have made thereof a new word, <q>His sanctifying.</q>  The unicorns are rightly understood to be those, whose firm hope is uplifted unto that one thing, concerning which another Psalm says, <q>One thing I have sought of the Lord, this I will require.</q>  But the sanctifying of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the Apostle Peter, is understood to be a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people and a royal <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note183655"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9</a></span> But that which follows, <q>in the land which He founded for everlasting:</q> which the Greek copies have <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03B1;&#x1F30;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;</span>, whether it be called by us <q>for everlasting,</q> or <q>for an age,</q> is at the pleasure of the Latin translators; forasmuch as it does signify either: and therefore the latter is found in some Latin copies, the former in others. Some also have it in the plural, that is, <q>for ages:</q> which in the Greek copies which we have had we have not found. But which of the faithful would <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even though, some going, others coming, she does pass out of this life in mortal manner, is yet founded for everlasting?</p>

<p>36. <q>And He chose David His servant</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse71">Psalm 77:71</a></span>. The tribe, I say, of Judah, for the sake of David: but David for the sake of Christ: the tribe then of Judah for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. At whose passing by blind men cried out, <q>Have pity on us, Son of David:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183656"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;20:30</a></span> and immediately by His pity they received light, because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> was the thing which they cried out. This then the Apostle does not cursorily speak of, but does heedfully notice, writing to Timothy, <q>Be thou mindful, that Christ Jesus has risen from the dead, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>,</q> etc. <span class="stiki" id="note183657"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:8</a></span> Therefore the Saviour Himself, made according to the flesh of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, is figured in this passage under the name of David, the Lord opening in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> His mouth. And let it not move us, that when he had said, <q>and He chose David,</q> under which name he signified Christ, he has added, <q>His servant,</q> not His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. Yea even hence we may perceive, that not the substance of the Only-Begotten coeternal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the <q>form of a servant</q> was taken of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>.</p>

<p>37. <q>And He took him from the flocks of sheep, from behind the teeming sheep He received him: to feed Jacob His servant, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His inheritance</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse72">Psalm 77:72</a></span>. This David indeed, of whose seed the flesh of Christ is, from the pastoral care of cattle was translated to the kingdom of men: but our David, Jesus Himself, from men to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, from <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, was yet according to the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> from sheep to sheep taken away and translated. For there are not now in that land <q>Churches of Jud&aelig;a in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> which belonged to them of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> after the recent Passion and Resurrection of our Lord, of whom says the Apostle, <q>But I was unknown by face to the Churches of Jud&aelig;a, which are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> etc. <span class="stiki" id="note183658"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;1:22-23</a></span> Already from hence those Churches of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> people have passed away: and thus in Jud&aelig;a, which now does exist on the earth, there is not now Christ.  He has been removed thence, now He does feed flocks of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Truly from behind teeming sheep He has been taken thence. For those former Churches were of such sort, as that of them it is said in the Song of Songs, <q>Your teeth&mdash; are like a flock of shorn ewes going up from the washing,  all of which do bear twins, and a barren one is not among them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183661"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:2</a></span> For they then laid aside like as it were fleeces the burdens of the world, <span class="stiki" id="note183662"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse45">Acts&nbsp;2:45</a></span> when before the feet of the Apostles they laid the prices of their sold goods, <span class="stiki" id="note183663"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse34">Acts&nbsp;4:34-35</a></span> going up from that Laver, concerning which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> does admonish them, when they were troubled because they had shed the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and he says, <q>Repent ye, and let each one of you be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be forgiven you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183664"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;2:38</a></span> But twins they begot, the works, to wit, of the two commandments of twin <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of one's neighbour: whence a barren one there was not among them. From behind these teeming sheep our David having been taken, does now feed other flocks among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and those too <q>Jacob</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> For thus has been said, <q>to feed Jacob His servant, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His inheritance.</q>...Unless perchance any one be willing to make such a distinction as this; viz. that in this time Jacob serves; but he will be the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at that time when he shall see God face to face, whence he has received the name <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note183665"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;32:28</a></span> </p>

<p>38. <q>And He fed them,</q> he says, <q>in the innocence of His heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse73">Psalm 77:73</a></span>. What can be more innocent than He, who not only had not any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whereby to be conquered, but even not any to conquer? <q>And in the understanding of His hands He led them home:</q> or, as some copies have it, <q>in the understandings of His hands.</q> Any other man might suppose that it would have been better had it been said thus, <q>in innocence of hands and understanding of heart;</q> but He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> better than others what He spoke, preferred to join with the heart innocence, and with the hands understanding. It is for this reason, as far as I judge; because many men think themselves innocent, who do not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things because they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest they should suffer if they shall have done them; but they have the will to do them, if they could with impunity. Such men may seem to have innocence of hands, but yet not that of heart. And what, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, or of what sort is that innocence, if of heart it is not, where man was made after the image of God? <span class="stiki" id="note183666"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;1:27</a></span> But in this which he says, <q>in understanding (or intelligence) of His hands He led them home,</q> he seems to me to have spoken of that intelligence which He does Himself make in <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>: and so <q>of His hands:</q> for making does belong to the hands, but in the sense wherein the hands of God may be understood; for even Christ was a Man in such sort, that He was also God....</p>
