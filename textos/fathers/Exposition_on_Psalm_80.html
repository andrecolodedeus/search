<h1>Exposition on Psalm 80</h1>


<p>1. ...If perchance things obscure demand the office of an interpreter, those things which are evident ought to require of me the office of a reader. The song here is of the Advent of the Lord and of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and of His vineyard. But the singer of the song is that Asaph, as far as does appear, enlightened and converted, by whose name ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> to be signified. Lastly, the title of the Psalm is: <q>For the end in behalf of them that shall be changed;</q> that is, for the better. For Christ, the end of the Law, <span class="stiki" id="note183742"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> has come on purpose that He should change men for the better. And he adds, <q>a testimony to Asaph himself.</q> A good testimony of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Lastly, this testimony does confess both Christ and the vineyard; that is, Head and Body, King and people, Shepherd and flock, and the entire <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of all Scriptures, Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But the title of the Psalm does conclude with, <q>for the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.</q> The <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> are interpreted, <q>men guiding.</q> Therefore it is no longer a generation which has not guided the heart  thereof, but now a generation guiding. Therefore hear we what he says in this testimony.</p>

<p>2. What is, <q>Thou that feedest <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, hearken,  You that conducts Joseph like sheep</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse1">Psalm 78:1</a></span>. He is being invoked to come, He is being expected until He come, He is being yearned for until He come. Therefore may He find <q>men guiding:</q> <q>You  that conducts,</q> he says, <q>Joseph like sheep:</q> Joseph himself like sheep. Joseph himself are the sheep, and Joseph himself is a sheep. Observe Joseph; for although even the interpretation of his name does aid us much, for it signifies increase; and He came indeed in order that the grain given to death  might arise manifold; <span class="stiki" id="note183745"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;12:24</a></span> that is, that the people of God might be increased....<q>You  that sits    upon the Cherubin.</q> Cherubin is the seat of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is interpreted the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. There God sits in the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Though we understand the Cherubin to be the exalted powers and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the heavens: yet, if you will, you will be Cherubin.  For if Cherubin is the seat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hear what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>: <q>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man is the seat of wisdom.</q> How, you say, shall I be the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? Who shall fulfil this? You have the means of fulfilling it: <q>The fullness of the Law is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183747"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> Do not run after many things, and strain yourself. The amplitude of the branches does terrify you: hold by the root, and of the greatness of the tree think not. Be there in you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> must needs follow. For what does he not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Inasmuch as it has been said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183748"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:8</a></span> <q>Appear.</q> For we went astray because You did not appear. <q>Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasse</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse2">Psalm 79:2</a></span>. Appear, I say, before the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, before the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. For there is Ephraim, there Manasses, there Benjamin. But to the interpretation let us look: Ephraim is fruit-bearing, Benjamin son of right hand, Manasses one forgetful. Appear Thou then before one made fruitful, before a son of the right hand: appear Thou before one forgetful, in order that he may be no longer forgetful, but You may come into his mind that hast delivered him....For weak You were when it was being said, <q>If <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> He is, let Him come down from the Cross.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183749"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;27:40</a></span> You were seeming to have no power: the persecutor had power over You: and You showed this aforetime, for Jacob too himself prevailed in wrestling, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Would he at any time, except the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had been willing? And man prevailed, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was conquered: and victorious man holds the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and says, <q>I will not let you go, except you shall have blessed me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183750"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;32:26</a></span> A great sacrament! He both stands conquered, and blesses the conqueror. Conquered, because he willed it; in flesh weak, in majesty strong....Having been crucified of weakness, rise      in power: <span class="stiki" id="note183751"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:4</a></span> <q>Stir up Your power, and come Thou, to save us.</q></p>

<p>3. <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, convert us.</q> For averse we have been from You, and unless  You convert us, we shall not be converted. <q>And illumine Your face, and we shall be saved</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse3">Psalm 79:3</a></span>. Hath He anywise a darkened face? He has not a darkened face, but He placed before it a cloud of flesh, and as it were a veil of weakness; and when He hung on the tree, He was not thought the Same as He was after to be acknowledged when He was sitting in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. For thus it has come to pass. Christ present on the earth, and doing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, Asaph <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not; but when He had died, after that He rose again, and ascended into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him. He was pricked to the heart, and he may have spoken  also of Him this testimony which now we acknowledge in this Psalm. You covered Your face, and we were sick: illumine Thou the same, and we shall be whole.</p>

<p>4. <q>O Lord God of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, how long will You be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Your servant?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse4">Psalm 79:4</a></span>. Now Your servant. You were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Your enemy, will You still be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Your servant? You have converted us, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, and will You still be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Your servant? You will evidently be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, in fact, as a father correcting, not as a judge condemning. In such manner evidently You will be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, because it has been written, <q>My son, drawing near unto the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, stand thou in righteousness and in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and prepare your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183753"><a href="../bible/sir002.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;2:1</a></span> Think not that now the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God has passed away, because you have been converted. The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God  has passed away from you, but only so that it condemn not for everlasting. But He scourges, He spares not: because He scourges every son whom He receives. <span class="stiki" id="note183755"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6</a></span> If you refuse to be scourged, why do you desire to be received? He scourges every son whom He receives. He who did not spare even His only Son, scourges every one. But nevertheless, <q>How long will You be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Your servant?</q> No longer your enemy: but, <q>You will be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Your servant,</q> how long? There follows: <q>You will feed us with the bread of tears, and wilt give us to drink with tears in measure</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse5">Psalm 79:5</a></span>. What is, <q>in measure</q>? Hear the Apostle: <q>Faithful is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who does not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able to bear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183756"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> The measure is, according to your powers: the measure is, that you be instructed, not that thou be crushed.</p>

<p>5. <q>You have set us for a contradiction to our neighbours</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse6">Psalm 79:6</a></span>. Evidently this did come to pass: for out of Asaph were chosen they that should go to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and preach Christ, and should have it said to them, <q>Who is this proclaimer of new <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>?</q>  <q>You have set us for a contradiction to our neighbours.</q> For they were preaching Him who was the subject of the contradiction. Whom did they preach? That after He was dead, Christ rose again. Who would hear this? Who would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this? It is a new thing. But signs did follow, and to an incredible thing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> gave credibility. He was contradicted, but the contradictor was conquered, and from being a contradictor was made a believer. There, however, was a great flame: there the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> fed with the bread of tears, and given to drink in tears, but in measure, not more than they are able to bear; in order that after the measure of tears there should follow a crown of joys. <q>And our enemies have sneered at us.</q> And where are they that sneered? For a long while it was said, Who are they that worship the Dead One, that adore the Crucified? For a long while so it was said. Where is the nose of them that sneered? Now do not they that censure flee into caves, that they may not be seen? But ye see what follows: <q>O Lord God of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, convert us, and show Your face, and we shall be whole</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse7">Psalm 79:7</a></span>. <q>A vineyard out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> You have brought over, You have cast out the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and hast planted her</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse8">Psalm 79:8</a></span>. It was done, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. How many nations were cast out? Amorites, Cethites, Jebusites, Gergesites, and Evites: after whose expulsion and overthrow, there was led in the people delivered  out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, into the land of promise. Whence the vineyard was cast out, and where she was planted, we have heard. Let us see what next was done, how she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, how much she grew, what ground she covered.</p>

<p>6. <q>A way You have made in the sight of her, and hast planted the roots of her, and she has filled the land</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse9">Psalm 79:9</a></span>. Would she have filled the land, unless a way had been made in the sight of her? What was the way which was made in the sight of her? <q>I am,</q> He says, <q>the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183758"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> With reason she has filled the land. That has now been said of this vineyard, which has been accomplished at the last. But in the mean time what? <q>She has covered the mountains with her shadow, and with her branch the cedars of God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse10">Psalm 79:10</a></span>. <q>You have stretched out her boughs even unto the sea, and even unto the river her shoots</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse11">Psalm 79:11</a></span>. This requires the office of an expositor, that of a reader and praiser  does not suffice: aid me with attention; for the mention of this vineyard in this Psalm is wont to overcloud with darkness the inattentive....But nevertheless the first <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation was this vine. But the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation reigned as far as the sea and as far as the river. As far as the sea; it appears in Scripture <span class="stiki" id="note183760"><a href="../bible/num034.htm#verse5">Numbers&nbsp;34:5</a></span> that the sea was in the vicinity thereof. And as far as the river Jordan. For on the other side of Jordan some part of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was established, but within Jordan was the whole nation. Therefore, <q>even unto the sea and even unto the river,</q> is the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: but not <q>from sea even unto sea, and from the river even unto the ends of the round world;</q>  this is the future perfection of the vineyard, concerning which in this place he has foretold. When, I say, he had foretold to you the perfection, he returns to the beginning, out of which the perfection was made. Of the beginning will you hear? <q>Even unto the river.</q> Of the end will you hear? <q>He shall have dominion from sea even unto sea:</q>  that is, <q>she has filled the earth.</q> Let us look then to the testimony of Asaph, as to what was done to the first vineyard, and what must be expected for the second vineyard, nay to the same vineyard....What then, the vineyard before the sight whereof a way was made, that she should fill the earth, at first was where? <q>Her shadow covered the mountains.</q> Who are the mountains? The Prophets. Why did her shadow cover them? Because darkly they spoke the things which were foretold as to come. You hear from the Prophets, Keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, on the eighth day circumcise a child, offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of ram, of calf, of he-goat. Be not troubled, her shadow does cover the mountains of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; there will come after the shadow a manifestation. <q>And her shrubs the cedars of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> that is, she has covered the cedars of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; very lofty, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the cedars are types of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, that must needs be overthrown. The <q>cedars of Lebanon,</q> the heights of the world, this vineyard did cover in growing, and the mountains of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Prophets and Patriarchs.</p>

<p>7. Then what? <q>Wherefore have You thrown down her enclosure?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse12">Psalm 79:12</a></span>. Now ye see the overthrow of that nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: already out of another Psalm you have heard, <q>with axe and hammer  they have thrown her down.</q>  When could this have been done, except her enclosure had been thrown down. What is her enclosure? Her defence. For she bore herself proudly against her planter. The servants that were sent to her and demanded a recompense, the husbandmen they scourged, beat, slew: there came also the Only Son, they said, <q>This is the Heir; come, let us kill Him, and our own the inheritance will be:</q> they killed Him, and out of the vineyard they cast Him forth.  When cast forth, He did more perfectly possess the place whence He was cast forth. For thus He threatens her through Isaiah, <q>I will throw down her enclosure.</q> Wherefore? <q>For I looked that she should bring forth grapes, but she brought forth thorns.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183766"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;5:2</a></span> I looked for fruit from thence, and I found <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Why then do you ask, O Asaph, <q>Why have You thrown down her enclosure?</q> For do you not know why? I looked that she should do judgment, and she did iniquity. Must not her enclosure needs be thrown down? And there came the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> when the enclosure was thrown down, the vineyard was assailed, and the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> effaced. This at first he is lamenting, but not without hope. For of directing the heart he is now speaking, that is, for the <q><a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>,</q> for <q>men directing,</q> the Psalm is. <q>Wherefore have You thrown down her enclosure: and there pluck off her grapes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> passing along the way.</q> What is <q>men passing along the way?</q> Men having dominion for a time.</p>

<p>8. <q>There has laid her waste the boar from the wood</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse13">Psalm 79:13</a></span>. In the boar from the wood what do we understand? To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a swine is an abomination, and in a swine they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> as it were the uncleanness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. But by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> was overthrown the nation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: but that king who overthrew, was not only an unclean swine, but was also a boar. For what is a boar but a savage swine, a <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> swine? <q>A boar from the wood has laid her waste.</q> <q>From the wood,</q> from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For she was a vineyard, but the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were woods. But when the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, there was said what? <q>Then there shall exult all the trees of the woods.</q>  <q>The boar from the wood has laid her waste; and a singular wild beast has devoured her.</q> <q>A singular wild beast</q> is what? The very boar that laid her waste is the singular wild beast. Singular, because <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. For thus says every <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> one, It is I, it is I, and no other.</p>

<p>9. But with what profit is this? <q>O God of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> turn Thou nevertheless</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse14">Psalm 79:14</a></span>. Although these things have been done, <q>Turn Thou nevertheless.</q> <q>Look from heaven and see, and visit this vineyard.</q> <q>And perfect Thou her whom Your right hand has planted</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse15">Psalm 79:15</a></span>. No other plant Thou, but this make Thou perfect. For she is the very seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, she is the very seed in whom all nations shall be blessed: <span class="stiki" id="note183768"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;22:18</a></span> there is the root where is borne the graffed wild olive. <q>Perfect Thou this vineyard which Your right hand has planted.</q> But wherein does He perfect? <q>And upon the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, whom You have strengthened to Yourself.</q> What can be more evident? Why do ye still expect, that we should still explain to you in discourse, and should we not rather cry out with you in admiration, <q>Perfect Thou this vineyard which Your right hand has planted, and upon the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a></q> perfect her? What <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>? Him <q>whom You have strengthened to Yourself.</q> A mighty stronghold: build as much as you are able. <q>For other foundation no one is able to lay, except that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183769"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:11</a></span> </p>

<p>10. <q>Things burned with fire, and dug up, by the rebuke of Your countenance shall perish</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse16">Psalm 79:16</a></span>. What are the things burned with fire and dug up which shall perish from the rebuke of His countenance? Let us see and perceive what are the things burned with fire and dug up. Christ has rebuked what? Sins: by the rebuke of His countenance <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have perished. Why then are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> burned with fire and dug up? Of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, two things are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in man, desire and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.  Think, examine, question your hearts, sift your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a>, see whether there can be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, except they be either of desire, or of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. There is set before you a reward to induce you to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that is, a thing which delights you; you do it, because you desire it. But perchance you will not be allured by <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>; you are terrified with menaces, thou do it because you fear. A man would <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> you, for example, to bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. Countless cases there are, but I am setting before you the plainer cases, whereby ye may <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the rest. Have you hearkened unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have you said in your heart, <q>What does it profit a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he gain the whole world, but of his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffer loss?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183771"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;16:26</a></span> I am not allured by a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> to lose my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>  to gain money. He turns himself to stir up <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> within you, he who was not able to corrupt you with a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a>, begins to threaten loss, banishment, massacres, perchance, and death. Therein now, if desire prevailed not, perchance <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> will prevail to make you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>....What had <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> done? It had dug up, as it were. For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> does inflame, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> does <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>: therefore, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, with fire were lighted: <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> were dug up. On the one hand, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> does <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and good <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> does light; but in different ways respectively. For even the husbandman interceding for the tree, that it should not be cut down, says, <q>I will dig about it, and will apply a basket of dung.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183773"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;13:8</a></span> The dug trench does signify the godly humility of one fearing, and the basket of dung the profitable squalid state of one repenting. But concerning the fire of good <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord says, <q>Fire I have come to send into the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183774"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> With which fire may the fervent in spirit burn, and they too that are inflamed with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their neighbour. And thus, as all good works are wrought by good <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and good <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are committed. Therefore, <q>Things set alight with fire and dug up,</q> to wit, all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, <q>by the rebuke of Your countenance shall perish.</q></p>

<p>11. <q>Let Your hand be upon the Man of Your right hand, and upon the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> whom You have strengthened Yourself</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse17">Psalm 79:17</a></span>. <q>And we depart not from You....You will quicken us, and Your Name we will invoke</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse18">Psalm 79:18</a></span>. You shall be sweet to us, <q>You will quicken us.</q> For aforetime we did <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> earth, not You: but You have mortified our members which are upon the earth. <span class="stiki" id="note183775"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, having earthly promises, seems to exhort that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should not be loved for nought, but that He should be loved because He gives something on earth. What do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so as not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God? Tell me. Love, if you can, anything which He has not made. Look round upon the whole creation, see whether in any place you are held with the birdlime of desire, and hindered from loving the Creator, except it be by that very thing which He has Himself created, whom you despise. But why do you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those things, except because they are beautiful? Can they be as beautiful as He by whom they were made? You admire these things, because you see not Him: but through those things which you admire, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him whom you see not. Examine the creation; if of itself it is, stay therein: but if it is of Him, for no other reason is it prejudicial  to a lover, than because it is preferred to the Creator. Why have I said this? With reference to this verse, brethren. Dead, I say, were they that did worship God that it might be well with them after the flesh: <q>For to be wise after the flesh is death:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183776"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;8:6</a></span> and dead are they that do not worship God gratis, that is, because of Himself He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not because He gives such and such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, which He gives even to men not good. Money will you have of God? Even a robber has it. Wife, abundance of children, soundness of body, the world's dignity, observe how many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men have. Is this all for the sake of which thou dost worship Him? Your feet will totter,  you will suppose yourself to worship without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, when you see those things to be with them who do not worship Him. All these things, I say, He gives even to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, Himself alone He reserves for good men. <q>You will quicken us;</q> for dead we were, when to earthly things we did cleave; dead we were, when of the earthly man we did bear the image. <q>You will quicken us;</q> You will renew us, the life of the inward man You will give us. <q>And Your Name we will invoke;</q> that is, You we will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.  You to us will be the sweet forgiver of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, You will be the entire reward of the justified. <q>O Lord God of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, convert us, and show Your face, and we shall be whole</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa079.htm#verse20">Psalm 79:20</a></span>.</p>
