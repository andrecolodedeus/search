<h1>Exposition on Psalm 83</h1>


<p>1. Of this Psalm the title is, <q>A song of a Psalm of Asaph.</q> We have already often said what is the interpretation of Asaph, that is, congregation. That man, therefore, who was called Asaph, is named in representation of the congregation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s people in the titles of many Psalms. But in Greek, congregation is called <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, which has come to be held for a kind of proper name for the Jewish people, that it should be called The Synagogue; even as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people is more usually called The <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in that it too is congregated.</p>

<p>2. The people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, in this Psalm says, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who shall be like You?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse1">Psalm 82:1</a></span>. Which I suppose to be more fitly taken of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because, being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note183848"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> He was thought by those by whom He was despised to be comparable to other men: for He was even <q>reckoned among the unrighteous,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183849"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;53:12</a></span> but for this purpose, that He might be judged. But when He shall come to judge, then shall be done what is here said, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is like You?</q> For if the Psalms did not use to speak to the Lord Christ, that too would not be spoken which not one of the faithful can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was spoken unto Christ. <q>Your throne, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is for ever and ever, a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Your kingdom.</q>  To him therefore also now it is said, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who shall be like You?</q> For unto many  You vouchsafed to be likened in Your humiliation, even so far as to the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> that were crucified with You: but when in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> You shall come, <q>who shall be like You?</q>...</p>

<p>3. <q>For lo Your enemies have sounded, and they that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> You have lifted up the head</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse2">Psalm 82:2</a></span>. He seems to me to signify the last days, when these things that are now repressed by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> are to break forth into free utterance, but quite irrational, so that it should rather be called a <q>sound,</q> than speech or discourse. They will not, therefore, then begin to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, but <q>they that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> You</q> will then <q>lift up the head.</q> And not <q>heads,</q> but <q>head;</q> since they are to come even to that point, that they shall have that head, which <q>is lifted up above all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that is worshipped;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183851"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:4</a></span> so that in him especially is to be fulfilled, <q>He that exalts himself shall be abased;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183852"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;14:11</a></span> and when He to whom it is said, <q>Keep not silence, nor grow mild, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> shall <q>slay him with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183853"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> <q>Upon Your people they have malignantly taken counsel</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse3">Psalm 82:3</a></span>. Or, as other copies have it, <q>They have cunningly devised counsel, and have devised against Your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q> In scorn this is said. For how should they be able to hurt the nation or people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to say, <q>If God be for us, who shall be against us?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183854"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse31">Romans&nbsp;8:31</a></span> </p>

<p>4. <q>They have said, Come, and let us destroy them from a nation</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse4">Psalm 82:4</a></span>. He has put the singular number for the plural: as it is said, <q>Whose is this cattle,</q> even though the question be of a flock, and the meaning <q>these cattle.</q> Lastly, other copies have <q>from nations,</q> where the translators have rather followed the sense than the word. <q>Come, and let us destroy them from a nation.</q> This is that sound whereby they <q>sounded</q> rather than spoke, since they did vainly make a noise with vain sayings. <q>And let it not be mentioned of the name of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> any more.</q> This others have expressed more plainly, <q>and let there not be remembrance of the name of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> any more.</q> Since, <q>let it be mentioned of the name</q> (<em>memoretur nominis</em>), is an unusual phrase in the Latin language; for it is rather customary to say, <q>let the name be mentioned</q> (<em>memoretur nomen</em>); but the sense is the same. For he who said, <q>let it be mentioned of the name,</q> translated the Greek phrase. But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> must here be understood in fact of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to which the Apostle says, <q>Therefore you are the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, according to the promise heirs.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183855"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse29">Galatians&nbsp;3:29</a></span> Not <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> according to the flesh, of which he says, <q>Behold <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> after the flesh.</q></p>

<p>5. <q>Since they have imagined with one consent; together against You have they disposed a testament</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse5">Psalm 82:5</a></span>: as though they could be the stronger. In fact, <q>a testament</q> is a name given in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> not only to that which is of no avail till the death of the testators, but every covenant and decree they used to call a testament. For Laban and Jacob made a testament, <span class="stiki" id="note183856"><a href="../bible/gen031.htm#verse44">Genesis&nbsp;31:44</a></span> which was certainly to have force between the living; and such cases without number are read in the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then he begins to make mention of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, under certain proper names of nations; the interpretation of which names sufficiently indicates what he would have to be understood. For by such names are most suitably figured the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>Idum&aelig;ans,</q> for instance, are interpreted either <q>men of blood,</q> or <q>of earth.</q> <q>Ismaelites,</q> are <q><a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to themselves,</q> and therefore not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to themselves. <q>Moab,</q> <q>from the father;</q> which in a bad sense has no better explanation, than by considering it so connected with the actual history, that <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>, a father, by the illicit intercourse procured by his daughter, begot him; since it was from that very circumstance he was so named. <span class="stiki" id="note183857"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse36">Genesis&nbsp;19:36-37</a></span> Good, however, was his father, but as <q>the Law is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> if one use it lawfully,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183858"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:8</a></span> not impurely and unlawfully. <q>Hagarens,</q> proselytes, that is strangers, by which name also are signified, among the enemies of God's people, not those who become citizens, but those who persevere in a foreign and alien <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and when an opportunity of doing harm occurs, show themselves. <q>Gebal,</q> <q>a vain valley,</q> that is, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in pretence. <q>Amon,</q> <q>an unquiet people,</q> or <q>a people of sadness.</q> <q>Amalech,</q> <q>a people licking;</q> whence elsewhere it is said, <q>and his enemies shall lick the earth.</q>  The <q>alien race,</q> though by their very name in Latin, they sufficiently show themselves to be aliens, and for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of course enemies, yet in the Hebrew are called <q><a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>,</q> which is explained, <q>falling from drink,</q> as of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> made drunken by worldly luxury. <q><a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a></q> in Hebrew is called Sor; which whether it be interpreted straitness or tribulation, must be taken in the case of these enemies of God's people in that sense, of which the Apostle speaks, <q>Tribulation and straitness on every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man that does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183860"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;2:9</a></span> All these are thus enumerated in the Psalms: <q>The tabernacles of the Edomites, Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagarenes, Gebal, and Amon, and Amalech, and the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a> with those who inhabit <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>.</q></p>

<p>6. And as if to point out the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why they are enemies of God's people, he adds, <q>For Assur came with them.</q> Now Assur is often used figuratively for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, <q>who works in the children of disobedience,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183861"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;2:2</a></span> as in his own vessels, that they may assail the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>They have helped the children of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>,</q> he says: for all enemies, by the working in them of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, their prince, <q>have helped the children of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a>,</q> who is explained to mean <q>one declining.</q> But the <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are well explained as the children of declension, for by declining from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they swerved to become followers of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. These are they of whom the Apostle speaks: <q>You wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, and the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in high places.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183862"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> Those invisible  enemies are helped then by unbelieving men, in whom they work in order to assail the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>7. Now let us see what the prophetic spirit <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> may fall upon them, rather foretelling than cursing. <q>Do thou to them,</q> he says, <q>as unto Madian and Sisera, as unto Jabin at the brook of Kishon</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse9">Psalm 82:9</a></span>. <q>They perished at Endor, they became as the dung of the earth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse10">Psalm 82:10</a></span>. All these, the history relates, were subdued and conquered by <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which then was the people of God: as was the case also with those whom he next mentions: <q>Make their princes like Oreb and Zeb, and Zebee and Salmana</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse11">Psalm 82:11</a></span>. The meaning of these names is as follows: Madian is explained a perverted judgment: Sisera, shutting out of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: Jabin, wise. <span class="stiki" id="note183864"><a href="../bible/jdg004.htm#verse7">Judges&nbsp;4:7-8</a></span> But in these enemies conquered by God's people is to be understood that wise man of whom the Apostle speaks, <q>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183865"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:20</a></span> Oreb is dryness, Zeb, wolf, Zebee, a victim, namely of the wolf; for he too has his victims; Salmana, shadow of commotion. All these agree to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which the people of God conquer by good. Moreover Kishon, the torrent in which they were conquered, is explained, their hardness. Endor, where they perished, is explained, the Fountain of generation, but of the carnal generation namely, to which they were given up, and therefore perished, not heeding the regeneration which leads unto life, where they shall neither marry nor be given in marriage, <span class="stiki" id="note183866"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;20:35</a></span> for they shall die no more. Rightly then it is said of these: <q>they became as the dung of the earth,</q> in that nothing was produced of them but fruitfulness of the earth. As then all these were in figure conquered by the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as figures, so he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that those other enemies may be conquered in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>8. <q>All their princes, who said, Let us take to ourselves the sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in possession</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse12">Psalm 82:12</a></span>. This is that vain noise, with which, as said above, Your enemies have made a murmuring. But what must be understood by <q>the sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> except the temple of God? As says the Apostle: <q>For the temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,  which temple you are.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183868"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> For what else do the enemies aim at, but to take into possession, that is, to make subject to themselves the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that it may give in to their ungodly wills?</p>

<p>9. But what follows? <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, make them like a wheel</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse13">Psalm 82:13</a></span>. This is fitly taken as meaning that they should be constant in nothing that they think; but I think it may also be rightly explained, make them like a wheel, because a wheel is lifted up on the part of what is behind,  is thrown down on the part of what is in front; and so it happens to all the enemies of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this is not a wish, but a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. He adds: <q>as the stubble in the face of the wind.</q> By face he means presence; for what face has the wind, which has no bodily features, being only a motion, in that it is a kind of wave of air? But it is put for <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, by which light and vain hearts are hurried away.</p>

<p>10. This levity, by which consent is easily given to what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is followed by severe torment; therefore he proceeds:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Like as the fire that burns up the wood, and as the flame that consumes the mountains</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse14">Psalm 82:14</a></span>: <q>so shall  You <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> them with Your tempest, and in Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> shall disturb them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse15">Psalm 82:15</a></span>. Wood, he says, for its barrenness, mountains for their loftiness; for such are the enemies of God's people, barren of righteousness, full of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. When he says, <q>fire</q> and <q>flame,</q> he means to repeat under another term, the idea of God judging and punishing. But in saying, <q>with Your tempest,</q> he means, as he goes on to explain, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>:</q> and the former expression, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>,</q> answers to, <q>You shall disturb.</q> We must take care, however, to understand, that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God is free from any turbulent emotion; for His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is an expression for His just method of taking vengeance: as the law might be said to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> when its ministers are moved to punish by its sanction.</p>

<p>11. <q>Fill their faces with shame, and they shall seek Your name, O Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse16">Psalm 82:16</a></span>. Good and desirable is this which he prophesies for them: and he would not prophesy thus, unless there were even in that company of the enemies of God's people, some men of such kind that this would be granted to them before the last judgment: for now they are mixed together, and this is the body of the enemies, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> whereby they rival the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And now, where they can, they make a noise and lift up their head: but severally, not universally as they will do at the end of the world, when the last judgment is about to fall. But it is the same body, even in those who out of this number shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and pass into another body (for the faces of these are filled with shame, that they may seek the name of the Lord), as well as in those others who persevere unto the end in the same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, who are made as stubble before the wind, and are consumed like a wood and barren mountains. To these he again returns, saying, <q>They shall blush and be vexed for ever and ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse17">Psalm 82:17</a></span>. For those are not vexed for ever and ever who seek the name of the Lord, but having respect unto the shame of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they are vexed for this purpose, that they may seek the name of the Lord, through which they may be no more vexed.</p>

<p>12. Again, he returns to these last, who in the same company of enemies are to be made ashamed for this purpose, that they may not be ashamed for ever: and for this purpose to be destroyed in as far as they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that being made good they may be found alive for ever. For having said of them, <q>Let them be ashamed and perish,</q> he instantly adds, <q>and let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Your name is the Lord, You are only the Most Highest in all the earth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa082.htm#verse18">Psalm 82:18</a></span>. Coming to this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, let them be so confounded as to please God: let them so perish, as that they may abide. <q>Let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> he says, <q>that Your name is the Lord:</q> as if whoever else are called lords are named so not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> but by <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, for they rule but as servants, and compared with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lord are not lords; as it is said, <em>I Am that I Am</em>: <span class="stiki" id="note183870"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> as if those things which are made are not, compared with Him by whom they are made. He adds, <q>You  only are the Most Highest in all the earth:</q> or, as other copies have it, <q>over all the earth;</q> as it might be said, in all the heaven, or over all the heaven: but he used the latter word in preference, to depress the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of earth.
