<h1>Exposition on Psalm 85</h1>


<p>1. ...Its title is, <q>A Psalm for the end, to the sons of Core.</q>  Let us understand no other end than that of which the Apostle speaks: for, <q>Christ is the end of the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183916"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> Therefore when at the head of the title of the Psalm he placed the words, <q>for the end,</q> he directed our heart to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If we fix our gaze on Him, we shall not stray: for He is Himself the Truth unto which we are eager to arrive, and He Himself the Way <span class="stiki" id="note183917"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> by which we run....</p>

<p>2. The Prophet sings to Him of the future, and uses words as it were of past time: he speaks of things future as if already done, because with God that which is future has already taken place....<q>Lord, You have been favourable unto Your land</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse1">Psalm 84:1</a></span>; as if He had already done so. <q>You have turned away the captivity of Jacob.</q> His ancient people of Jacob, the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, born of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed, in the promise to become one day the heir of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That was indeed a real people, to whom the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was given; but in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> the New was figured: that was the figure, this the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> expressed. In that figure, by a kind of foretelling of the future, there was given to that people a certain land of promise, in a region where the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> abode; where also is the city of Jerusalem, whose name we have all heard of. When this people had received possession of this land, they suffered many troubles from their neighbouring enemies who surrounded them: and when they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they were given into captivity, not for destruction, but for discipline; their Father not condemning, but scourging them. And after being seized on, they were set free, and many times were both made captives, and set free; and they are now in captivity, and that for a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even because they crucified their Lord. What then are we to understand them to mean by the words, <q>You have turned away the captivity of Jacob</q>?...This Psalm has prophesied in song. <q>You have turned away the captivity of Jacob.</q> To whom did it speak? To Christ; for it said, <q>for the end, for the sons of Core:</q> for He has turned away the captivity of Jacob. Hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself confessing: <q>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> He asked who it should be, and straightway it occurred to him, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183918"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24-25</a></span> Of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God the Prophet speaks to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <q>You have turned away the captivity of Jacob.</q> Attend to the captivity of Jacob, attend, and see that it is this: You have turned away our captivity, not by setting us free from the barbarians, with whom we had not met, but by setting us free from bad works, from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> held sway over us. For if any one has been set free from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the prince of sinners has not whence he may hold sway over him.</p>

<p>3. For how did He turn away the captivity of Jacob? See, how that that setting free is spiritual, see how that it is done inwardly. <q>You have forgiven,</q> he says, <q>the iniquity of Your people: You have covered all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse2">Psalm 84:2</a></span>. Behold how He has turned away their captivity, in that He has remitted iniquity: iniquity held them captive; your iniquity forgiven, you are freed. Confess therefore that you are in captivity, that you may be worthy to be freed: for he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not of his enemy, how can he invoke the liberator? <q>You have covered all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> What is, <q>You have covered</q>? So as not to see them. How did You not see them? So as not to take vengeance on them. You were unwilling to see our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and therefore You saw them not, because You would not see them: <q>You have covered all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <q>You have appeased all Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: You have turned Yourself from Your wrathful indignation</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse3">Psalm 84:3</a></span>.</p>

<p>4. And as these things are said of the future, though the sound of the words is past, it follows: <q>Turn us, O God of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse4">Psalm 84:4</a></span>. That which he had just related as if it were done, how <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> he that it may be done, except because he wished to show that he had spoken as if of the past in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>? But that it was not yet done which he had said was done he shows by this, that he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> that it may be done: <q>Turn us, O God of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and turn away Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> from us.</q> Did you not say before: <q>You have appeased all Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, You have turned Yourself from Your wrathful indignation</q>? How then now do you say, <q>And turn away Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> from us</q>? The Prophet answers: These things I speak of as done, because I see them about to be done: but because they are not yet done, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they may come, which I have already seen.</p>

<p>5. <q>Be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse5">Psalm 84:5</a></span>. For by the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God we are subject to death, and by the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God we eat bread on this earth in want, and in the sweat of our face. <span class="stiki" id="note183919"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> This was Adam's sentence when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: and that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was every one of us, for <q>in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183920"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22</a></span> the sentence passed on him has taken effect after him on us. For we were not yet ourselves, but we were in Adam: therefore whatever happened to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself took effect on us also, so that we should die: for we all were in him....So far as this the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of your father hurts you not, if you have changed yourself, even as it would not hurt your father if he had changed himself. But that which our stock has received unto its subjection to death, it has derived from Adam. What has it so derived? That frailty of the flesh, this torture of pains, this house of poverty, this chain of death, and snares of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>; all these things we carry about in this flesh; and this is the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because it is the vengeance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But because it was so to be, that we should be regenerated, and by believing should be made new, and all that mortality was to be removed in our resurrection, and the whole man was to be restored in newness; <q>For as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183921"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:22</a></span> seeing this the Prophet says, <q>Be not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us for ever, nor stretch out Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> from one generation to another.</q> The first generation was mortal by Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: the second generation shall be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> by Your mercy....</p>

<p>6. <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, You shall turn us again, and make us alive</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse6">Psalm 84:6</a></span>. Not as if we ourselves of our own accord, without Your mercy, turn unto You, and then You shall make us alive: but so that not only our being made alive is from You, but our very conversion, that we may be made alive. <q>And Your people shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in You.</q> To their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in themselves: to their own good they shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in You. For when they wished to have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of themselves, they found in themselves woe: but now because God is all our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, he that will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> securely, let him <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in Him who cannot perish. For why, my brethren, will you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in silver? Either your silver perishes, or thou: and no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> which first: yet this is certain, that both shall perish; which first, is uncertain. For neither can man remain here always, nor can silver remain here always: so too gold, so garments, so houses, so money, so broad lands, so, lastly, this light itself. Be not thou willing then to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in these: but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in that light which has no setting: <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in that dawn which no yesterday precedes, which no tomorrow follows. What light is that? <q>I,</q> says He, <q>am the Light of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183922"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;8:12</a></span> He who says unto you, <q>I am the Light of the world,</q> calls you to Himself. When He calls you, He converts you: when He converts you, He heals you: when He has healed you, you shall see your Converter, unto whom it is said, <q>Show us Your mercy, O Lord, and grant us Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse7">Psalm 84:7</a></span>: Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that is, Your Christ.  Happy is he unto whom God shows His mercy. He it is who cannot indulge in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, unto whom God shows His mercy. For by showing him His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> He persuades him that whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man has, he has not but from Him who is all our good. And when a man has seen that whatever good he has he has not from himself, but from his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; he sees that everything which is praised in him is of the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not of his own deserving; and seeing this, he is not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>; not being <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, he is not lifted up; not lifting himself up, he falls not; not falling, he stands; standing, he clings fast; clinging fast, he abides; abiding, he enjoys, and rejoices in the Lord his God. He who made him shall be unto him a delight: and his delight no one spoils, no one interrupts, no one takes away....Therefore, what says John in his Epistle? <q>Beloved, now are we the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it does not yet appear what we shall be.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183924"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> Who would not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, if suddenly while he was wandering abroad, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his descent, suffering want, and in a state of misery and toil, it were announced, You are the son of a senator: your father enjoys an ample patrimony on your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> estate; I bid you return to your father: how would he <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, if this were said to him by some one whose promise he could trust? One whom we can trust, an Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has come and said to us, You have a father, you have a country, you have an inheritance. Who is that father? <q>Beloved, we are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183925"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> ...Therefore He  promised us to show Himself unto us. Think, my brethren, what His beauty is. All those beautiful things which you see, which you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, He made. If these are beautiful, what is He Himself? If these are great, how great is He? Therefore from these things which we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> here, let us the more long for Him: and despising these things, let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him: that by that very <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we may by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> purify our hearts, and His vision, when it comes, may find our heart purified. The light which shall be shown unto us ought to find us whole: this is the work of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> now. This is what we have spoken here: <q>And grant us Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>:</q> grant us Your Christ, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Your Christ, see Your Christ; not as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> saw Him and crucified Him, but as the Angels see Him, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</p>

<p>7. <q>I will hearken</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse8">Psalm 84:8</a></span>. The Prophet spoke: God spoke within in him, and the world made a noise without. Therefore, retiring for a little from the noise of the world, and turning himself back upon himself, and from himself upon Him whose voice he heard within; sealing up his ears, as it were, against the tumultuous disquietude of this life, and against the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> weighed down by the corruptible body, and against the imagination, that through the earthly tabernacle pressing down,  thinks on many things, <span class="stiki" id="note183928"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> he says, <q>I will hearken what the Lord God speaks in me;</q> and he heard, what? <q>For He shall speak peace unto His people.</q> The voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then, the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is peace: it calls unto peace. Ho! It says, whosoever are not yet in peace, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> ye peace: for what can you find better from Me than peace? What is peace? Where there is no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. What is this, where there is no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>? Where there is no contradiction, where there is no resistance, nothing to oppose. Consider if we are yet there: consider if there is not now a conflict with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, if all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and faithful ones wrestle not with the prince of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. And how do they wrestle with him whom they see not? They wrestle with their own desires, by which he suggests unto them <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: and by not consenting to what he suggests, though they are not conquered, yet they fight. Therefore there is not yet peace where there is fighting....Whatever we provide for our refreshment, there again we find weariness. Are you hungry? One asks you: you answer I am. He places food before you for your refreshment; continue thou to use it, for you had need of it; yet in continuing that which you need for refreshment, therein do you find weariness. By long sitting you were tired; you rise and refreshest yourself by walking; continue that relief, and by much walking you are wearied; again you would sit down. Find me anything by which you are refreshed, wherein if you continue thou dost not again become weary. What peace then is that which men have here, opposed by so many troubles, desires, wants, wearinesses? This is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, no perfect peace. What will be perfect peace? <q>This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183929"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span> ...Persevere in eating much; this itself will kill you: persevere in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> much, by this you will die: sit continually, being resolved not to rise up, by this you will die: be always walking so as never to take rest, by this you will die; watch continually, taking no sleep, by this you will die; sleep continually, never watching, thus too you will die. When therefore death shall be swallowed up in victory, these things shall no longer be: there will be full and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> peace. We shall be in a City, of which, brethren, when I speak I find it hard to leave off, especially when offenses wax common. Who would not long for that City whence no friend goes out, whither no enemy enters,  where is no tempter, no seditious person, no one dividing God's people, no one wearying the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the service of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; since the prince himself of all such is cast into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, and with him those who consent unto him, and who have no will to retire from him? There shall be peace made pure in the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all loving one another, seeing one another full of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since God shall be all in all. <span class="stiki" id="note183931"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:28</a></span> We shall have <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as our common object of vision, God as our common possession, God as our common peace. For whatever there is which He now gives unto us, He Himself shall be unto us instead of His gifts; this will be full and perfect peace. This He speaks unto His people: this it was which he would hearken unto who said, <q>I will hearken what the Lord God will say unto me: for He shall speak peace unto His people, and to His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and unto those who turn their hearts unto Him.</q> Lo, my brethren, do ye wish that unto you should belong that peace which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> utters? Turn your heart unto Him: not unto me, or unto that one, or unto any man. For whatever man would turn unto himself the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he falls with them. Which is better, that you fall with him unto whom you turn yourself, or that thou stand with Him with whom you turn yourself? Our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, our peace, our rest, the end of all troubles, is none but God: blessed are <q>they that turn their hearts unto Him.</q></p>

<p>8. <q>Nevertheless, His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is near them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse9">Psalm 84:9</a></span>. There were some even then who feared Him in the Jewish people. Everywhere throughout the earth <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were worshipped: devils were feared, not God: in that nation God was feared. But why was He feared? In the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> He was feared, lest He should give them up to captivity, lest He should take away their land from them, lest He should destroy their vines with hail, lest He should make their wives barren, lest He should take away their children from them. For these carnal promises of God captivated their minds, which as yet were of small growth, and for these things God was feared: but He was near unto them who even for these things feared Him. The Pagan <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for land to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: the Jew <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for land to God: it was the same thing which they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, but not the same to whom they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. The latter, though seeking what the Pagan sought, yet was distinguished from the Pagan; for he sought it of Him who had made all things. And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who was far  from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, was near  unto them: yet He had regard even to those who were afar off, and to those who were near, as the Apostle said: <q>And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off, and to them that were near.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183934"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;2:17</a></span> Whom did He mean by those near? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, because they  worshipped one God. Whom by those who were afar off? The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, because they had left Him by whom they were made and worshipped things which themselves had made. For it is not in space that any one is far from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in affections. You love <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you are near unto Him. You hate  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you are far off. You are standing in the same place, both while you are near and far off. This it was, my brethren, which the Prophet had regard to: although he saw the mercy of God extending over all, yet he saw something special and peculiar shown toward the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and he says, <q>Nevertheless, I will hearken what the Lord God shall say unto me: for He shall speak peace unto His people;</q> and His people shall be, not Jud&aelig;a only, but it shall be gathered together out of all nations: <q>For He shall speak peace unto His Saints, and to those who turn their hearts unto Him,</q> and to all who shall turn their hearts unto Him from the whole world. <q>Nevertheless, His <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> shall be near them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may dwell in our land:</q> that is, in that land in which the Prophet was born, greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall dwell, because Christ began to be preached from thence. Thence were the Apostles, and there first they were sent; from thence were the Prophets, there first was the Temple, there <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there were the Patriarchs, there He Himself came of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, there Christ was manifested, there Christ appeared; for from thence was the Virgin Mary who bore Christ. There He walked with His feet, there He worked <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Thirdly, He ascribed so great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to that nation, that when a certain Canaanitish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> interrupted Him, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the healing of her daughter, He said unto her, <q>I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183936"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;15:24</a></span> Seeing this, the Prophet says, <q>that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may dwell in our land.</q></p>

<p>9. <q>Mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have met together</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse10">Psalm 84:10</a></span>. <q>Truth in our land,</q> in a Jewish person, <q>mercy</q> in the land of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For where was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Where the utterances of God were. Where was mercy? On those who had left their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and turned themselves unto devils. Did He look down  also upon them? Yea, as if He said, Call those who are fugitives afar off, who have departed far from Me: call them, let them find Me who seek them, since they themselves would not seek Me. Therefore, <q>Mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each other.</q> Do righteousness, and you shall have peace; that righteousness and peace may <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> each other. For if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not righteousness, you shall not have peace; for those two, righteousness and peace, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> one another: that he who has done righteousness may find peace kissing righteousness. They two are friends: thou perhaps willest the one, and not the other: for there is no one who wills not peace: but all will not work righteousness. Ask all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, Willest thou peace? With one mouth the whole race of man answers you, I wish, I desire, I will, I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it. Love also righteousness: for these two, righteousness and peace, are friends; they <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> one another: if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the friend of peace, peace itself will not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, nor come unto you. For what great thing is it to desire peace? Every bad man longs for peace. For peace is a good thing. But do righteousness, for righteousness and peace <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> one another, they quarrel not together....</p>

<p>10. <q>Truth has sprung out of the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse11">Psalm 84:11</a></span>. <q>Truth has sprung out of the earth:</q> Christ is born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has come forth of the flesh. What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. What is the earth? Flesh. Ask whence Christ was born, and you see that <q>Truth is sprung out of the earth.</q> But the Truth which sprang out of the earth was before the earth, and by It the heaven and the earth were made: but in order that righteousness  might look down from heaven, that is, in order that men might be justified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, Truth was born of the Virgin Mary; that He might be able to offer a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to justify them, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of suffering, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the Cross. And how could He offer a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, except He died? How could He die, except He received from us that wherein He might die; that is, unless He received from us mortal flesh, Christ could not have died: because the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> dies not, Godhead dies not, the Virtue and Wisdom of God does not die. How should He offer a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, a healing victim, if He died not? How should He die, unless He clothed Himself with flesh? How should He put on flesh, except <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sprang out of the earth?</p>

<p>11. On the same passage we may mention another meaning. <q>Truth is sprung out of the earth:</q> confession from man. For thou, O man, wast a sinner. O earth, who when you had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> heard the sentence, <q>Earth you are, and unto earth shall you return,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183938"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> from you let <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> spring, that righteousness may look down from heaven. How does <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> spring from you, while you are a sinner, while you are unrighteous? Confess your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall spring out of you. For if while you are unrighteous, you call yourself just, how can <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> spring out of you? But if being unrighteous thou dost confess yourself to be so, <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has sprung out of the earth.</q>...What <q>righteousness has looked down from heaven</q>? It is that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though He said: Let us spare this man, for he spares not himself: let us pardon him, for he himself confesses. He is changed so as to punish his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: I too will change, so as to set him free.</p>

<p>12. <q>For the Lord shall give sweetness, and our land shall give her increase</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse12">Psalm 84:12</a></span>....He will give unto you the sweetness of working righteousness, so that righteousness shall begin to delight you, whom before unrighteousness delighted: so that thou who at first delighted in <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in sobriety: and thou who at first rejoiced in theft, so as to take from another man what you had not, shall seek to give to him that has not that which you have: and thou who took delight in robbing, shall delight now in giving: thou whom shows delighted, shall delight in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; thou who delighted in trifling and lascivious songs, shall now delight in singing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; in running to church, thou who at first ran to the theatre. Whence is that sweetness born to you, except from this, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gives sweetness</q>? For, behold, you see what I mean: behold, I have spoken unto you the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have sown seed in your devout hearts, finding your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> furrowed, as it were, with the plough of confession: with devout attention you have received the seed; think now upon the word which you have heard, like those who break up the clouds, lest the fowls should carry away the seed, that what is sown may be able to spring up there: and unless God rain upon it, what profits it that it is sown? This is what is meant by <q>our land shall give her increase.</q> May He with His visitations, in leisure, in business, in your house, in your bed, at meal-time, in conversation, in walks, visit your hearts, when we are not by. May the rain of God come and make to sprout what is sown there: and when we are not by, and are resting quietly, or otherwise employed, may God give increase to the seeds which we have sown, that remarking afterwards your improved characters, we too may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for your fruit.</p>

<p>13. <q>For righteousness shall go before him, and he shall direct his steps in the way</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa084.htm#verse14">Psalm 84:14</a></span>: that righteousness, namely, which consists in confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: for this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself. For you ought to be righteous towards yourself, and to punish yourself: for this is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> righteousness, that you should punish yourself, who art <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and God should make you good. Therefore since this is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> righteousness, this becomes a way for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that God may come unto you: there make for Him a way, in confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Therefore John too, when he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> in the water of repentance, and would have men come to him repenting of their former <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, spoke thus: <q>Prepare the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.</q>  You pleased yourself in your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, O man: let that which you were displease you, that you may be able to become what you were not. Prepare the way of the Lord: let that righteousness go before, of confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: He will come and visit you, for now He has where to place His steps, He has whereby He may come to you. Before you confessed your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, you had shut up the way of God: there was no way by which He might come unto you. Confess your past life, and you open a way; and Christ shall come unto you, and <q>shall place His steps in the way,</q> that He may guide you with His own footsteps.</p>
