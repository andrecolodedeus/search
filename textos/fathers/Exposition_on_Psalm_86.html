<h1>Exposition on Psalm 86</h1>


<p>1. No greater gift could God have given to men than in making His Word, by which He created all things, their Head, and joining them to Him as His members: that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> might become also the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, one God with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, one Man with men; so that when we speak to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for mercy, we do not separate the Son from Him; and when the Body of the Son <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, it separates not its Head from itself: and it is one Saviour of His Body, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who both <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for us, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in us, and is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to by us. He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for us, as our Priest; He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in us, as our Head; He is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to by us, as our God. Let us therefore recognise in Him our words, and His words in us. Nor when anything is said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, especially in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, implying a degree of humility below the dignity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us hesitate to ascribe it to Him who did not hesitate to join Himself unto us....He is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the form of a servant He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>; there the Creator, here created; assuming unchanged the creature, that it might be changed, and making us with Himself one Man, Head and Body. Therefore we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to Him, through Him, in Him; and we speak with Him, and He speaks with us; we speak in Him, He speaks in us the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of this Psalm, which is entitled, <q>A Prayer of David.</q> For our Lord was, according to the flesh, the son of David; but according to His divine nature, the Lord of David, and his Maker....Let no one then, when he hears these words, say, Christ speaks not; nor again say, I speak not; nay rather, if he own himself to be in the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let him say both, Christ speaks, and I speak. Be thou unwilling to say anything without Him, and He says nothing without you....</p>

<p>2. <q>Bow down Your ear, O Lord, and hear me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse1">Psalm 85:1</a></span>. He speaks in the form of a servant: speak thou, O servant, in the form of your Lord: <q>Bow down Your ear, O Lord.</q> He bows down His ear, if you dost not lift up your neck: for unto the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> He draws near: from him that is exalted He removes afar off, except whom He Himself has exalted from being <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. God then bows down His ear unto us. For He is above, we below: He in a high place, we in a lowly one, yet not deserted. <q>For while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. For scarcely for a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man will one die: yet for a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man perhaps one would even dare to die:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183941"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;5:8,&nbsp;7</a></span> but our Lord died for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For no merits of ours had gone before, for which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should die: but the more, because there were no merits, was His mercy great. How sure then, how firm is the promise, by which for the righteous He keeps His life, who for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> gave His own death! <q>For I am poor and in misery.</q> To the rich then He bows not down His ear: unto the poor and him that is in misery He bows down His ear, that is, unto the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and him that confesses, unto him that is in need of mercy: not unto him that is full, who lifts up himself and boasts, as if he wanted nothing, and says, <q>I thank You that I am not as this Publican.</q> For the rich <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> boasted of his merits: the poor Publican confessed his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note183942"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;18:11-13</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Yet do not take what I have said, my brethren, in such a way, as if God does not hear those who have gold and silver, and a household, and farms, if they happen to be born to this estate, or hold such a rank in the world: only let them remember the Apostle's words: <q>Charge those who are rich in this world, that they be not highminded.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183943"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:17</a></span> For those that are not highminded are poor in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to the poor and needy and those in want He inclines His ear. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that their hope is not in gold and silver, nor in those things in which for a time they seem to abound. It is enough that riches ruin them not; it is enough that they do them no harm: for good they can do them none. What certainly profits is a work of mercy, done by a rich or by a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man: by a rich man, with will and deed; by a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man, with will alone. When therefore he is such an one as despises in himself everything which is wont to swell men with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, he is one of God's poor: He inclines unto him His ear, for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that his heart is contrite....Was it really for the merit of his poverty that the poor man was carried away by Angels, <span class="stiki" id="note183944"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;16:19-24</a></span> or was it for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his riches that the rich man was sent away to be tormented? In that poor man is signified the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which is paid to humility, in that rich man the condemnation which awaits <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. I will prove shortly that it was not riches but <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> which was tormented in that rich man. It is certain that the poor man was carried into the <a href="../cathen/01055a.htm">bosom of Abraham</a>: of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that he had here very much gold and silver, and was rich on the earth. <span class="stiki" id="note183945"><a href="../bible/gen013.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;13:2</a></span> If every one that is rich is hurried away to be tormented, how could <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> have gone before that poor man, so as to be ready to receive him when carried to his bosom? But <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in his riches was poor, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, reverencing all commands, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> them. So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> was it that he counted all those riches for nothing, that on God's command he was ready to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> his son, <span class="stiki" id="note183946"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;22:10</a></span> for whom he was keeping his riches. Learn therefore ye to be poor and needy, whether you have anything in this world, or whether you have not....</p>

<p>4. <q>Preserve  My Soul, for I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse2">Psalm 85:2</a></span>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether any one could say this, <q>I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> but He who was in the world without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: He by whom all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were not committed but remitted.  We own it to be His voice saying, <q>Preserve  My Soul, for I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>;</q> of course in that form of a servant which He had assumed. For in that was flesh, in that, was also a Soul. For He was not, as some  have said, only Flesh and the Word: but Flesh and Soul also, and the Word, and all this, One <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, One Christ, One Saviour; in the form of God equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in the form of a servant the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. When therefore I hear, <q>for I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> I recognise His voice: yet do I exclude my own? Surely He speaks inseparably from His body when He speaks thus. Shall I then dare to say, <q>For I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a></q>? If <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> as making <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and as needing none to sanctify, I should be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and false: but if <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> as made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, as it is written, <q>Be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, for I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183949"><a href="../bible/lev019.htm#verse2">Leviticus&nbsp;19:2</a></span> then the body of Christ may venture, and that one Man <q>crying from the end of the earth,</q>  may venture with his Head, and under his Head, to say, <q>For I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q> For he has received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Baptism, and of remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note183951"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:11</a></span> ...Say unto your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, for You have sanctified me: because I received, not because I had: because You gave, not because I deserved. For on another side you are beginning to do an injury to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself. For if all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who are faithful and have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Him have put Him on, as the Apostle says, <q>As many as are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Christ have put on Christ:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183952"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians&nbsp;3:27</a></span> if they have been made members of His body, and say that they are not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, they do injury to their Head, of whom they are members, and yet not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Look thou where you are and from your Head assume dignity. For thou were in darkness, <q>but now light in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183953"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> <q>You were sometime darkness,</q> he says: but did ye remain darkness? Was it for this the Enlightener came, that you might still remain darkness, or that in Him ye might become light? Therefore, every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> by himself, therefore also the whole body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, may say, it may cry everywhere, while it suffers tribulations, various <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> and offenses, it may say, <q>Preserve  my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for I am <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>: my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save Your servant, that puts his trust in You.</q> See thou, that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man is not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, since he puts his trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>5. <q>Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I have cried unto You all day</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse3">Psalm 85:3</a></span>. Not <q>one day:</q> understand <q>all day</q> to mean continually: from the time that the body of Christ groans being in afflictions, until the end of the world, when afflictions pass away, that man groans and calls upon God: and each one of us after his measure has his part in that cry in the whole body. You have cried in your days, and your days have passed away: another has come after you, and cried in his days: and thou here, he there, another elsewhere: the body of Christ cries all the day, its members departing and succeeding one another. One Man it is that reaches to the end of the world: the same members of Christ cry, and some members already rest in Him, some still cry, some when we shall be at rest will cry, and after them others will cry. It is the whole body of Christ whose voice He hears, saying, <q>Unto You have I cried all the day.</q> Our Head on the right hand of the Father intercedes for us: some members He recovers, others He scourges, others He cleanses, others He comforts, others He is creating, others calling, others recalling, others correcting, others restoring.</p>

<p>6. <q>Make glad the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Your servant: for unto You, O Lord, have I lifted up my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse4">Psalm 85:4</a></span>. Make it glad, for unto You have I lifted it up. For it was on earth, and from the earth it felt bitterness: lest it should wither away in bitterness, lest it should lose all the sweetness of Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, I lifted it up unto You: make  it glad with Yourself. For  You alone are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>: the whole world is full of bitterness. Surely with reason He admonishes His members to lift up their hearts. May they hear and do it: may they lift up unto Him what on earth is ill. There the heart decays not, if it be lifted up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If you had grain in your rooms below, you would take it up higher, lest it should grow rotten. Would you remove your grain, and do you suffer your heart to rot on the earth? You would take your grain up higher: lift up your heart to heaven. And how can I, do you say? What ropes are needed? What machines? What ladders? Your affections are the steps: your will the way. By loving you mount, by neglect you descend. Standing on the earth you are in heaven, if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God. For the heart is not so raised as the body is raised: the body to be lifted up changes its place: the heart to be lifted up changes its will.</p>

<p>7. <q>For  You, Lord, art good and gracious</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse5">Psalm 85:5</a></span>....Even <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are often hindered by vain thoughts, so that the heart scarcely remains fixed on God: and it would hold itself so as to be fixed, and somehow flees from itself, and finds no frames in which it can enclose itself, no bars by which it may keep in its flights and wandering movements, and stand still to be made glad by its God. Scarcely does one such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> occur among many. Each one might say that this happened to him, but that it happened not to others, if we did not find in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture David <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in a certain place, and saying, <q>Since I have found my heart, O Lord, so that I might <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto You.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183954"><a href="../bible/2sa007.htm#verse27">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;7:27</a></span> He said that he had found his heart, as if it were wont to flee from him, and he to follow it like a fugitive, and not be able to catch it, and to cry to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>For my heart has deserted me.</q>  Therefore, my brethren, thinking over what he says here, I think I see what he means by <q>gracious.</q> I seem to feel that for this reason he calls God gracious, because He bears with those failings of ours, and yet expects <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> from us, in order to make us perfect: and when we have given it to Him, He receives it gratefully, and listens to it, and remembers not those many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which we pour out unthinkingly, and accepts the one which we can scarcely find. For what man is there, my brethren, who, on being addressed by his friend, when he wishes to answer his address, sees his friend turn away from him and speak to another, who is there who would bear this? Or if you appeal to a judge, and set him up to hear you, and all at once, while you are speaking to him, pass from him, and begin to converse with your friend, who would endure this? Yet God endures the hearts of so many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and think of different things....What then? Must we despair of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and say that every man is already condemned into whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> any wandering thoughts have crept and interrupted them? If we say this, my brethren, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what hope remains. Therefore because there is some hope before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because His mercy is great, let us say unto Him, <q>For unto You, O Lord, have I lifted up my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> And how have I lifted it up? As I could, as You gave me strength, as I could catch it when it fled away....From infirmity I sink: heal      me, and I shall stand: strengthen      me, and I shall be strong. But until  You do this, You bear with me: <q>For  You, Lord, are good and gracious, and of great mercy.</q> That is, not only <q>of mercy,</q> but <q>of great mercy:</q> for as our iniquity abounds, so also abounds Your mercy. <q>Unto all that call upon You.</q> What is it then which <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says in many places: <q>They shall call, and I will not hear them</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note183956"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;1:28</a></span> Yet surely You are merciful to all that call upon You; but that some call, yet call not upon Him, of whom it is said, <q>They have not called upon God.</q>  They call, but not on God. You call upon whatever you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: you call upon whatever you call unto yourself, whatever you wish to come unto you. Therefore if you call upon God for this reason, in order that money may come unto you, that an inheritance may come unto you, that worldly rank may come unto you, you call upon those things which you desire may come unto you: but you make God the helper of your desires, not the listener to your needs. God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if He gives what you wish? What if you wish ill, will He not then be more merciful by not giving? Then, if He gives not, then is God nothing to you; and you say, How much I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, how often I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and have not been heard! Why, what did you ask? Perhaps that your enemy might die. What if he at the same time were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for your death? He who created you, created him also: you are a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he too is a man; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the Judge: He hears both, and He grants their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to neither. You are sad, because you were not heard when <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> against him; be glad, because his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was not heard against you. But you say, I did not ask for this; I asked not for the death of my enemy, but for the life of my child; what ill did I ask?  You asked no ill, as you thought. What if <q>he was taken away, lest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183958"><a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse11">Wisdom&nbsp;4:11</a></span> But he was a sinner, you say, and therefore I wished him to live, that he might be corrected. You wished him to live, that he might become better; what if God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, that if he lived he would become worse?...If, therefore, you call on God as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be confident you shall be heard: you have part in that verse: <q>And of great mercy unto all that call upon You.</q>...</p>

<p>8. Think, brethren, and reflect what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things God gives unto sinners: and learn hence what He keeps for His own servants. To sinners who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him every day He gives the sky and the earth, He gives springs, fruits, health, children, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, abundance: all these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things none gives but God. He who gives such things to sinners, what do you think He keeps for His faithful ones? Is this to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> of Him, that He who gives such things to the bad, keeps nothing for the good? Nay verily He does keep, not earth, but heaven for them. Too common a thing perhaps I say when I say heaven; Himself rather, who made the heaven. Fair is heaven, but fairer is the Maker of heaven. But I see the heavens, Him I see not. Because you have eyes to see the heavens: a heart you have not yet to see the Maker of heaven: therefore came He from heaven to earth, to cleanse the heart, that He may be seen who made heaven and earth. But wait thou with full patience for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. By what treatment to cure you, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>: by what cutting, what burning, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. You have brought sickness on yourself by sinning: He comes not only to nurse, but also to cut and to burn. Seest thou not how much men suffer under the hands of physicians, when a man promises them an uncertain hope? You will be cured, says the physician: you will be cured, if I cut. It is a man who speaks, and to a man that he speaks: neither is he sure who speaks, nor he who hears, for he who is speaking to the man has not made man, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not perfectly what is passing in man: yet at the words of a man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what is passing in man, man sooner <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>, submits his limbs, suffers himself to be bound, often without being bound is cut or burned; and receives perhaps health for a few days, even when just healed not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> when he may die: perhaps, while being healed, dies; perhaps cannot be healed. But to whom has God promised anything, and deceived him?</p>

<p>9. <q>Fix my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in Your ears, O Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse6">Psalm 85:6</a></span>. Great earnestness of him who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>! That is, let not my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> go out of Your ears, fix it then in Your ears. How did he travail that he might fix his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the ears of God? Let God answer and say to us; Would you that I fix your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in My ears? Fix My law in your heart; <q>and attend to the voice of my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</q></p>

<p>10. <q>In the day of my trouble I have cried unto You, for You have heard me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse7">Psalm 85:7</a></span>. A little before he had said, All the day have I cried, all the day have I been troubled. Let no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> then say that there is any day in which he is not troubled. By <q>all the day</q> we have understood the whole of time. What then, is there trouble even when it is well with us? Even so, trouble. How is there trouble? Because <q>as long as we are in the body we are absent from the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183959"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> Let what will abound here, we are not yet in that country whither we are hastening to return. He to whom foreign travel is sweet, loves not his country: if his country is sweet, travel is bitter; if travel is bitter, all the day there is trouble. When is there not trouble? When there is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in one's country. <q>At Your right hand are delights for evermore.</q>  <q>You shall fill me with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>,</q> he says, <q>with Your countenance: that I may see the delight of the Lord.</q>  There toil and groaning shall pass away: there shall be not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> but praise; there <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>, there <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, the voice in concord with Angels; there vision without failing and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> without weariness. So long therefore as we are not there, you see that we are not in that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But do all things abound? If all things abound, see if you are assured that all things perish not. But I have what I had not: more money has come to me which I had not before. Perhaps more <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> too has come, which you had not before: perhaps you were so much the more secure as you were the poorer. In fine, be it that you have <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, that you have redundance of this world's affluence, that you have assurance given you that all this shall not perish; besides this, that God say unto you, You shall remain for ever in these things, they shall be for ever with you, but My face you shall not see. Let none ask counsel of the flesh: ask ye counsel of the Spirit: let your heart answer you; let hope, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, charity, which has begun to be in you, answer. If then we were to receive assurance that we should always be in affluence of worldly goods, and if God were to say to us, My face you shall not see, would ye <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in these goods? Some one might perhaps choose to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and say, These things abound unto me, it is well with me, I ask no more. He has not yet begun to be a lover of God: he has not yet begun to sigh like one far from home. Far be it, far be it from us: let them retire, all those seductions: let them retire, those false blandishments: let them be gone, those words which they say daily unto us, <q>Where is your God?</q> Let us pour out our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>  over us,  let us confess in tears, let us groan in confession, let us sigh in misery. Whatever is present with us besides our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is not sweet: we would not have all things that He has given, if He gives not Himself who gave all things.</p>

<p>11. <q>Among the gods there is none like You, O Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse8">Psalm 85:8</a></span>. What did he say? <q>Among the gods,</q> etc. Let the Pagans make for themselves what gods they will; let them bring workmen in silver and in gold, furbishers, sculptors; let them make gods. What kind of gods? Having eyes, and seeing not;  and the other things which the Psalm mentions in what follows. But we do not worship these, he says; we do not worship them, these are <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>. What then do ye worship? Something else that is worse: for the gods of the gentiles are devils. What then? Neither, say they, do we worship devils. You have certainly nothing else in your temples, nothing else inspires your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> than a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.  But what do ye say? We worship Angels, we have Angels as gods. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not altogether what Angels are. Angels worship the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and favour not men who wish to worship Angels and not God. For we find Angels of high rank  forbidding men to adore them, and commanding them to adore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. <span class="stiki" id="note183967"><a href="../bible/rev019.htm#verse10">Revelation&nbsp;19:10</a></span> But when they say Angels, suppose they mean men, since it is said, <q>I have said, You are Gods, and all the children of the Most Highest.</q>  Whatever  man thinks to the contrary, that which was made is not like Him who made it. Except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whatever else there is in the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What a difference there is between Him who made, and that which was made, who can worthily <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>? Therefore this man said, <q>there is none like You, O Lord: there is not one that can do as you do.</q> But how much God is unlike them he said not, because it cannot be said. Let your Charity attend: God is ineffable: we more easily say what He is not than what He is.  You think    of the earth; this is not God: you think of the sea; this is not God: of all things which are in the earth, men and animals; this is not God: of all things which are in the sea, which fly through the air; this is not God: whatever shines in the sky, the stars, sun and moon; this is not God: the heaven itself; this is not God: think of the Angels, Virtues, Powers, Archangels, Thrones, Seats, Principalities; this is not God. What is He then? I could only tell you, what He is not. Askest thou what He is? What <q>the eye has not seen, nor the ear heard, nor has risen up into the heart of man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183970"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> ...</p>

<p>12. <q>All nations that You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse9">Psalm 85:9</a></span>. He has announced the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: <q>All nations.</q> If there is any nation which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not made, it will not worship Him: but there is no nation which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not made; because God made <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>, the source of all nations, thence all nations sprang. All nations therefore has God made. When was this said? When before Him there worshipped none but a few <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men in one people of the Hebrews, then this was said: and see now what it is which was said: <q>All nations that You have made,</q> etc. When these things were spoken, they were not seen, and they were <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: now that they are seen, why are they denied? <q>All nations that You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, and shall glorify Your Name.</q></p>

<p>13. <q>For You are great, and doing wondrous things:  You alone are the great God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse10">Psalm 85:10</a></span>. Let no man call himself great. Some were to be who would call themselves great: against these it is said, <q>You alone are the great God.</q> For what great thing is ascribed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when it is said that He alone is the great God? Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that He is the great God? But because there were to be some who would call themselves great and make God little, against these it is said, <q>You alone are the great God.</q> For what You say is fulfilled, not what those say who call themselves great. What has God said by His Spirit? <q>All nations.</q> What says he, whoever he is, who calls himself great? <q>Far from it: God is not worshipped in all nations: all nations have perished, Africa alone remains.</q> This you say, who callest yourself great:  another thing He says who alone is the great God. What says He, who alone is the great God? <q>All nations.</q> I see what the only great God has said: let man be silent, who is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> great; great only in appearance, because he disdains to be small. Who disdains to be small? He who says this. Whoever will be great among you, said the Lord, shall be your servant. <span class="stiki" id="note183972"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;20:26</a></span> If that man had wished to be the servant of his brethren, he would not have separated them from their mother: but when he wishes to be great, and wishes not to be small, as would be for his welfare, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note183973"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James&nbsp;4:6</a></span> because He alone is great, fulfills all things which He predicted, and contradicts those who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>. For such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who say that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has perished from the whole world, and is left only in Africa. If you were to say to him, You will lose your villa, he would perhaps scarcely keep from laying his hand upon you: and yet he says, that Christ has lost His inheritance, redeemed by His own Blood! See now what a wrong he does, my brethren. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>In a wide nation is the king's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; but in the domination of the people is the affliction  of a prince.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183975"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;14:28</a></span> This wrong then thou dost unto Christ, to say that His people is diminished to that small number. Was it for this you were born, for this you call yourself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, that you may grudge Christ His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, whose sign you say that you bear on your forehead, and hast lost out of your heart? In a wide nation is the king's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>: acknowledge your King: give Him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, give Him a wide nation. What wide nation shall I give Him, do you say? Choose not to give Him from your own heart, and you will give aright. Whence am I to give? You will say. Lo, give from hence: <q>All nations that You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord.</q> Say this, confess this, and you have given a wide nation: for all nations in One are one: this is very oneness. For as there is a Church and Churches, and those are Churches which also are a Church, so that is a nation which was nations: formerly nations, many nations, now one nation. Why one nation? Because one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one hope, one charity, one expectation. Lastly, why not one nation, if one country? Our country is heavenly, our country is Jerusalem: whoever is not a citizen of it, belongs not to that nation: but whoever is a citizen of it is in that one nation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this nation, from the east to the west, from the north and the sea, is extended through the four quarters of the whole world. This God says: From the east and west, from the north and the sea, give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This He foretold, this He fulfilled, who alone is great. Let him therefore who would not be little cease from saying this against Him who alone is great: for there cannot be two great, God and Donatus. </p>

<p>14. <q>Lead me, O Lord, in Your way, and I will walk in Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse11">Psalm 85:11</a></span>. Your way, Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Your life, is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Therefore belongs the Body to Him, and the Body is of Him. I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life. <span class="stiki" id="note183977"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> <q>Lead me, O Lord, in Your way.</q> In what way? <q>And I will walk in Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> It is one thing to lead to the way, another to guide in the way. Behold man everywhere poor, everywhere in need of help. Those who are beside the way are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, or not yet <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>: let them be guided to the way: but when they have been brought to the way and made <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they must be guided by Him in the way itself, lest they fall.  Now assuredly they walk in the way. <q>Lead me, O Lord, in Your way:</q> surely I am now in Your way, lead me there. <q>And I will walk in Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>:</q> while You lead I shall not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>: if Thou let me go, I shall <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>. Pray then that He let you not go, but lead you even to the end. How does He lead you? By always admonishing, always giving you His hand. And the arm of the Lord, to whom is it revealed? <span class="stiki" id="note183979"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1</a></span> For in giving His Christ He gives His hand: in giving His hand, He gives His Christ. He leads to the way, in leading to His Christ: He leads in the way, by leading in His Christ, and Christ is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <q>Lead me,</q> therefore, <q>O Lord, in Your way, and I will walk in Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>:</q> in Him verily who said, <q>I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183980"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> For Thou who leadest in the way and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whither leadest Thou, but unto life? In Him then, unto Him You lead.</p>

<p>15. <q>Let my heart be made glad, so that it may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Your name.</q> There is then <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. How can there be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, if <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? Is not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> wont to be painful? There will hereafter be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, now <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; for not yet is there perfect security, nor perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. If there is no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, we faint: if full security, we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> wrongly. Therefore may He both sprinkle on us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, and strike <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> into us, that by the sweetness of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> He may lead us to the abode of security; by giving us <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us not to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> wrongly, and to withdraw from the way. Therefore says the Psalm: <q>Serve the Lord in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> unto Him with trembling:</q>  so also says the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>; <q>Work out your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling; for it is God that works in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183982"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;2:12-13</a></span> Whatever prosperity comes then, my brethren, is rather to be feared: those things which you think to be prosperous, are rather <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. An inheritance comes, there comes <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, there is an abundant overflow of some <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: these are <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>: take care that they corrupt you not. Whatever prosperity also there is according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ: if perhaps you have gained your wife, who was of the party of Donatus: if your sons have been made <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> who were Pagans: if perhaps you have gained your friend who wished to draw you away to the theatres, and you have drawn him to the church: if some hostile opponent of yours who was furiously mad against you, laying aside his fury, has become gentle, and owned <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and now barks at you no more, but cries with you against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: these things are pleasant. For what do we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for, if we do not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for these things? Or what other are our joys, but these? But because tribulations also abound, and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, and dissensions, and schisms, and other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>,  without which this world cannot be, until iniquity pass away: let not that rejoicing make us secure, but let our heart be so made glad, as to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the name of the Lord, lest it be made glad on one side, be stricken on another. Expect not security in journeying: if ever we wish for it here, it will be the birdlime of the body,  not the safety of the man. <q>Let my heart be made glad, so that it may <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Your name.</q></p>

<p>16. <q>I will confess unto You, O Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in my whole heart, and I will glorify Your name for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse12">Psalm 85:12</a></span>: <q>for great is Your mercy toward me, and You have delivered my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the nethermost <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse13">Psalm 85:13</a></span>. Do not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, brethren, if I do not explain what I have said as though I were certain. For I am a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and as much as is granted to me concerning the sacred Scriptures, so much I venture to speak: nothing of myself. Hades  I have not yet seen, nor have you: and there will be perhaps another way for us, and not through Hades. These things are uncertain. But because Scripture, which cannot be gainsaid, says, <q>You have delivered my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the nether-most <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,</q> we understand that there are as it were two hells, an upper one and a lower one: for how can there be a lower <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, unless because there is also an upper? The one would not be called lower, except by comparison with that upper part. It appears then, my brethren, that there is some heavenly abode of Angels: there is there a life of ineffable joys, there <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and incorruption, there all things abiding according  to the gift and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That part of the creation is above. If then that is above, but this earthly part, where is flesh and blood, where is corruptibleness, where is nativity and mortality, departure and succession, changeableness and inconstancy, where are fears, desires, horrors, uncertain joys, frail hope, perishable <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; I suppose that all this part cannot be compared with that heaven of which I was just now speaking; if then this part cannot be compared with that, the one is above, the other below. And whither do we go after death, unless there is a depth deeper than this depth  in which we are in the flesh and in this mortal state? For <q>the body is dead,</q> says the Apostle, <q>because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183987"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;8:10</a></span> Therefore even here are the dead; that you may not wonder because it is called <em>infernum</em>, if it abounds with the dead. For he says not, the body is about to die: but, <q>the body is dead.</q> Even now surely our body has life: and yet compared with that body which is to be like the bodies of Angels, the body of man is found to be dead, although still having life. But again, from this <em>infernum</em>, that is from this part of Hades, there is another lower, whither the dead go: from whence God would rescue our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, even sending there His own Son. For it was on account of these two hells, my brethren, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was sent, on all sides setting free. To this <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> he was sent by being born, to that by dying. Therefore it is His voice in that Psalm, not according to any man's conjecture, but an Apostle explaining, when he says, <q>For You will not leave my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q>  Therefore it is here also either His voice, <q>You have delivered my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the nethermost <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>:</q> or our voice by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself: for on this account He came even unto <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, that we might not remain in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</p>

<p>17. I will mention another opinion also. For perhaps even in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> itself there is some lower part where are thrust the ungodly who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> most.  For whether in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> there were not some places where <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was, we cannot define sufficiently. For not yet had the Lord come to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> that He might rescue from thence the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who had gone before,  and yet <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was there in repose. <span class="stiki" id="note183991"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;16:22</a></span> And a certain rich man when he was in torments in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, when he saw <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, lifted up his eyes. He could not have seen him by lifting up his eyes, unless the one was above, the other below. And what did <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> answer unto him, when he said, <q>send Lazarus.</q> <q>My son,</q> he said, <q>remember that thou in your lifetime received your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and likewise Lazarus <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things: but now he is at rest, but you are tormented. And besides this,</q> he said, <q>between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that neither can we go to you, nor can any one come from thence to us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183992"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;16:24-26</a></span> Therefore between these two hells, perhaps, in one of which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the just have gotten rest, in the other the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the ungodly are tormented, one waiting and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> here, placed here in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in the voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, said that God had delivered his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the nethermost <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, because He delivered him from such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as might have been the means of drawing him down to the torments of the nethermost <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>....Some one having a troublesome <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was to be sent to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>: another comes and defends him; what does he say when he thanks him? You have delivered my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. A debtor was to be hanged up:  his debt is paid; he is said to be delivered from being hanged up. They were not in all these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: but because they were in such due course towards them,  that unless aid had been brought, they would have been in them, they rightly say that they are delivered from thence, whither they were not suffered by their deliverers to be taken. Therefore, brethren, whether it be this or that, consider me to be herein an inquirer into the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not a rash assertor. </p>

<p>18. <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the transgressors of the law have arisen up against me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse14">Psalm 85:14</a></span>. Whom calls he transgressors of the law? Not the Pagans, who have not received the law: for no one transgresses that which he has not received; the Apostle says clearly, <q>For where there is no law, there is no prevarication.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183996"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;4:15</a></span> Transgressors of the law he calls <q>prevaricators.</q> Whom then do we understand, brethren? If we take this word from our Lord Himself, the transgressors of the law were the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>....They did not keep the law, and accused Christ as if He transgressed the law. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the Lord suffered. Do you think His Body suffers no such thing now? How can this be? <q>If they called the Master of the house <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, how much more those of his household? The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is not above his master, nor the servant above his lord.</q>  The body also suffers transgressors of the law, and they rise up against the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Who are the transgressors of the law? Do the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> perchance dare to rise up against Christ? No: for it is not they that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us much trouble. For they have not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: they have not yet owned their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Against the Body of Christ bad <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> rise up, from whom the Body of Christ daily suffers trouble. All schisms, all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, all within who live wickedly and engraft their own character on those who live well, and draw them over to their own side, and with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications corrupt good manners; these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <q>transgressing the law rose up against Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note183998"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:33</a></span> Let every <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> speak, let every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> speak. That one which suffers not this, let it not speak. But if it is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it suffers <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: if it owns in itself its own sufferings, let it own herein its own voice; but if it is without suffering, let it  also be without the voice; but that it may not be without suffering, let it walk along the narrow way, <span class="stiki" id="note184000"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;7:14</a></span> and begin to live godly in Christ: it must of necessity suffer this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. For <q>all,</q> says the Apostle, <q>who will live godly in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184001"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:12</a></span> </p>

<p><q>And the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the powerful have sought after My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> The <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the powerful is the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. The <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the powerful rose up against the Head, that is, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, crying and saying with one mouth, Crucify Him, crucify Him: <span class="stiki" id="note184002"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;19:6</a></span> of whom it is said, <q>The sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, their teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.</q>  They did not strike, but cried: by crying they struck, by crying they crucified Him. The will of those who cried was fulfilled, when the Lord was crucified: <q>And they did not place You before their eyes.</q> How did they not place Him before them? They did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him God. They should have spared him as Man: what they saw, according to this they should have walked. Suppose that He was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He was man: was He therefore to be slain? Spare Him a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and own Him God.</p>

<p>19. <q>And You, Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, art One who hast compassion and merciful, longsuffering, and very pitiful, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse15">Psalm 85:15</a></span>. Wherefore longsuffering and very pitiful, and One who hast compassion? Because hanging on the Cross He said: <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184004"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> Whom <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> He to? For whom does He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>? Who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>? Where <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> He? The Son <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, crucified for the ungodly, in the midst of very insults, not of words but of death inflicted, hanging on the Cross; as if for this He had His hands stretched out, that thus He might <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them, that His <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> might be directed like <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the lifting up of His hands like an evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q> </p>

<p>20. If therefore You are <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q> <q>Look upon me, and have mercy upon me: give power unto Your servant.</q> Because You are <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q> <q>give power unto Your servant</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse16">Psalm 85:16</a></span>. Let the time of patience pass away, the time of judgment come. How, <q>give power</q>? The Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment unto the Son. <span class="stiki" id="note184006"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;5:22</a></span> He rising again will come even to earth Himself to judge: He will appear terrible who appeared despicable. He will show His power, who showed His patience; on the Cross was patience; in the judgment will be power. For He will appear as Man judging, but in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: because <q>as you saw Him go,</q> said the Angels, <q>so He will come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184007"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;1:11</a></span> His very form shall come to judgment; therefore the ungodly also shall see Him: for they shall not see the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

Therefore He adds a consequence, and says: <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184009"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;14:10</a></span> that is, both in Me seen the Father is seen, and in the Father seen the Son too is seen. The vision of the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> cannot be separated: where nature and substance is not separated, there vision cannot be separated. For that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the heart ought to be made ready for that place, to see the Divinity of the Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, in which though not seen we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and by believing cleanse the heart that there may be able to be sight: the Lord Himself says in another place, <q>He that has My commands and keeps them, he it is that loves Me: and he that loves Me shall be loved by My Father: and I will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, and will manifest Myself unto him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184010"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;14:21</a></span> Did they not see Him, with whom He was talking?

<p>21. <q>And save the Son of Your handmaid.</q> The Lord is the Son of the handmaid. Of what handmaid? Her who when He was announced as about to be born of her, answered and said, <q>Behold the handmaid of the Lord: be it unto me according to Your word.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184011"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;1:38</a></span> He saved the Son of His handmaid, and His own Son: His own Son, in the Form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note184012"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;1:6</a></span> the Son of His handmaid in the form of a servant. Of the handmaid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, the Lord was born in the form of a servant; and He said, <q>Save the Son of Your handmaid.</q> And He was saved from death, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, His flesh, which was dead, being raised again....And each several <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> placed in the Body of Christ may say, <q>Save the Son of Your handmaid.</q> Perhaps he cannot say, <q>Give power unto Your servant:</q> because it was He, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who received power. Yet wherefore says He not this also? Was it not said to servants, <q>You shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note184013"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;19:28</a></span> and the servants say, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we shall judge Angels?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184014"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:3</a></span> Each one therefore of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> receives also power, and each several saint is the son of His handmaid.

<p>22. <q>Show me a sign for good</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa085.htm#verse17">Psalm 85:17</a></span>. What sign, but that of the Resurrection? The Lord says: <q>This <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and provoking generation seeks after a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonah.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184015"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;12:39</a></span> Therefore in our Head a sign has been shown already for good; each one of us also may say, <q>Show me a sign for good:</q> because at the last trumpet, at the coming of the Lord, both <q>the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184016"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse52">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:52</a></span> This will be a sign for good. <q>That they who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> me may see it, and be ashamed.</q> In the judgment they shall be ashamed unto their destruction, who will not now be ashamed unto their healing. Now therefore let them be ashamed: let them accuse their own ways, let them keep the good way: because none of us lives without being ashamed, unless he first be ashamed and live anew. Now God grants them the approach of a healthy shame, if they despise not the medicine of confession: but if they will not now be ashamed, then they shall be ashamed, when <q>their iniquities shall convince them to their face.</q>  How shall they be ashamed? When they shall say, <q>These are they whom we had sometimes in derision, and a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of reproach.

<p>23. <q>For  You, Lord, have helped me, and comforted me.</q> <q>Have helped me,</q> in struggle; <q>and comforted me,</q> in sorrow. For no one seeks comfort, but he who is in misery. Would ye not be consoled? Say that you are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, and you hear, <q>My people</q> (now ye answer, and I hear a murmur, as of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who remember the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.  May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has written this in your hearts, confirm it in your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. You see, brethren, that those who say unto you, You are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, seduce you), <q>O My people, they that call you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, and disturb the way of your feet.</q>  So also from the Epistle of the Apostle James: <q>Be afflicted, and mourn: let your laughter be turned to mourning.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184022"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse9">James&nbsp;4:9</a></span> You see what you have heard read: when would such things be said unto us in the land of security? This surely is the land of offenses, and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, and of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, that we may groan here, and deserve to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> there; here to be troubled, and there to be comforted, and to say, <q>For You have delivered my eyes from tears, my feet from falling: I will please the Lord in the land of the living.</q>  This is the land of the dead. The land of the dead passes, the land of the living comes. In the land of the dead is labour, grief, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, tribulation, <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, groaning, sighing: here are false <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> ones, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> unhappy, because <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is false, misery is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.

Nothing is so akin to misery as mourning: nothing so remote and contrary to misery as blessedness: You speak of those who mourn, and You call them blessed! Understand, He says, what I say: I call those who mourn blessed. Wherefore blessed? In hope. Wherefore mourning? In act. For they mourn in this death, in these tribulations, in their wandering: and because they own themselves to be in this misery, and mourn, they are blessed. Wherefore do they mourn? The blessed Cyprian was put to sorrow in his passion: now he is comforted with his crown; now though comforted, he was sad. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> still intercedes for us: all the Martyrs who are with Him intercede for us. Their intercessions pass not away, except when our mourning is passed away: but when our mourning shall have passed away, we all with one voice, in one people, in one country, shall receive comfort, thousands of thousands joined with Angels playing upon harps, with choirs of heavenly powers living in one city. Who mourns there? Who there sighs? Who there toils? Who there needs? Who dies there? Who there shows mercy? Who breaks bread to the hungry there, where all are satisfied with the bread of righteousness? No one says unto you, Receive a stranger; there no one will be a stranger to you: all live in their own country. No one says unto you, Set at one your friends disputing; in everlasting peace they enjoy the Face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. No one says unto you, Visit the sick; health and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> abide for ever. No one says unto you, Bury the dead; all shall be in everlasting life. Works of mercy stop, because misery is found not. And what shall we do there? Shall we perhaps sleep? If now we fight against ourselves, although we carry about a house of sleep, this flesh of ours, and keep watch with these lights, and this solemn feast gives us a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to watch; what wakefulness shall that day give unto us! Therefore we shall be awake, we shall not sleep. What shall we do?  There will be no works of mercy, because there will be no misery. Perhaps there will be these necessary works which there are here now, of sowing, ploughing, cooking, grinding, weaving? None of these, for there will be no want. Thus there will be no works of mercy, because misery is past away: where there is no want nor misery, there will be neither works of necessity nor of mercy. What will be there? What business shall we have? What action? Will there be no action, because there is rest? Shall we sit there, and be torpid, and do nothing? If our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> grow cold, our action will grow cold. How then will that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> resting in the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for whom we now long, for whom we sigh, how will it inflame us, when we shall have come to Him? He for whom while as yet we see Him not, we so sigh, how will He enlighten us, when we shall have come to Him? How will He change us? What will He make of us? What then shall we do, brethren? Let the Psalm tell us: <q>Blessed are they who dwell in Your house.</q> Why? <q>They shall praise You for ever and ever.</q>  This will be our employment, praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You love and praisest. You will cease to praise, if you cease to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But you will not cease to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because He whom you see is such an One as offends you not by any weariness: He both satisfies you, and satisfies you not. What I say is wonderful. If I say that He satisfies you, I am afraid lest as though satisfied you should wish to depart, as from a dinner or from a supper. What then do I say? Does He not satisfy you? I am afraid again, that if I say, He does not satisfy you, you should seem to be in want: and should be as it were empty, and there should be in you some void which ought to be filled. What then shall I say, except what can be said, but can hardly be thought? He both satisfies you, and satisfies you not: for I find both in Scripture. For while He said, <q>Blessed are the hungry, for they shall be filled;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184027"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;5:6</a></span> it is again said of Wisdom, <q>Those who eat You shall hunger again, and those who drink shall thirst again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184028"><a href="../bible/sir024.htm#verse21">Sirach&nbsp;24:21</a></span> Nay, but He did not say <q>again,</q> but he said, <q>still:</q> for <q>shall thirst again</q> is as if once having been filled he departed and digested, and returned to drink. So it is, <q>Those who eat You shall still hunger:</q> thus when they eat they hunger: and those who drink You, even thus when drinking, thirst. What is it, to thirst in drinking? Never to grow weary. If then there shall be that ineffable and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> sweetness, what does He now seek of us, brethren, but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned, firm hope, pure charity? And man may walk in the way which the Lord has given, may bear troubles, and receive consolations.</p>
