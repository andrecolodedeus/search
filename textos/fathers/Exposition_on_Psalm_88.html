<h1>Exposition on Psalm 88</h1>


<p>1. The Title of this eighty-seventh Psalm contains a fresh subject for enquiry: the words occurring here, <q>for Melech to respond,</q> being nowhere else found. We have already given our opinion on the meaning of the titles <em>Psalmus Cantici</em> and <em> Canticum Psalmi</em>:  and the words, <q>sons of Core,</q> are constantly repeated, and have often been explained: so also <q>to the end;</q> but what comes next in this title is peculiar. For <q>Melech</q> we may translate into Latin <q>for the chorus,</q> for chorus is the sense of the Hebrew word Melech.. ..The Passion of our Lord is here prophesied. Now the Apostle Peter says, <q>Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow His steps;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184073"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:21</a></span> this is the meaning of <q>to respond.</q> The Apostle John also says, <q>As Christ laid down His life for us, so ought we also to lay down our lives for the brethren;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184074"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:16</a></span> this also is to respond. But the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> signifies concord, which consists in charity: whoever therefore in imitation of our Lord's Passion gives up his body to be burnt, if he have not charity, does not answer in the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a>, and therefore it profits him nothing. <span class="stiki" id="note184075"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> Further, as in Latin the terms Precentor and Succentor are used to denote in music the performer who sings the first part, and him who takes it up; just so in this song of the Passion, Christ going before is followed by the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> unto the end of gaining crowns in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. This is sung by <q>the sons of Core,</q> that is, the imitators of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Passion: as Christ was crucified in Calvary, which is the interpretation of the Hebrew word Core. <span class="stiki" id="note184076"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;27:33</a></span> This also is <q>the understanding of &AElig;man the Israelite:</q>  words occurring at the end of this title. &AElig;man is said to mean, <q>his brother:</q> for Christ deigns to make those His brethren, who understand the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His Cross, and not only are not ashamed of it, but faithfully <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in it, not praising themselves for their own merits, but grateful for His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: so that it may be said to each of them, <q>Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184078"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse47">John&nbsp;1:47</a></span> just as <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> himself, that he was without guile. <span class="stiki" id="note184079"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;25:27</a></span> </p>

<p>2. <q>O Lord God of my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, I have cried day and night before You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse1">Psalm 87:1</a></span>. Let us therefore now hear the voice of Christ singing before us in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, to whom His own <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> should respond either in imitation, or in thanksgiving.</p>

<p><q>O let my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> enter into Your presence, incline Your ear unto my calling</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse2">Psalm 87:2</a></span>. For even our Lord <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, not in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in the form of a servant; for in this He also suffered. He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> both in prosperous times, that is, by <q>day,</q> and in calamity, which I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> is meant by <q>night.</q> The entrance of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> into God's presence is its acceptance: the inclination of His ear is His compassionate listening to it: for God has not such bodily members as we have. The passage is however, as usual, a repetition. </p>

<p>3. <q>For my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is filled with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and my life draws near unto <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse3">Psalm 87:3</a></span>. Dare we speak of the Soul of Christ as <q>filled with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>,</q> when the passion had strength as far as it had any, only over the body?...The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> therefore may feel pain without the body: but without the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the body cannot. Why therefore should we not say that the Soul of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was full of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of humanity, though not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Another Prophet says of Him, that He grieved for us: <span class="stiki" id="note184081"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;53:4</a></span> and the Evangelist says, <q>And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy:</q> and our Lord Himself says unto them of Himself, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184082"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;26:37-38</a></span> The Prophet who composed this Psalm, foreseeing that this would happen, introduces Him saying, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is full of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and My life draws near unto <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> For the very same sense is here expressed in other words, as when He said, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful, even unto death.</q> The words, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful,</q> are like these, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is full of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>:</q> and what follows, <q>even unto death,</q> like, <q>my life draws near unto <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> These feelings of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity our Lord took upon Him, as He did the flesh of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, and the death of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh, not by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of His condition, but by the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> of His mercy, that He might transfigure into Himself His own body, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (the head of which He deigned to be), that is, His members in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and faithful <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: that if amid <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> any one among them happened to be in sorrow and pain, he might not therefore think that he was separated from His favour: that the body, like the chorus following its leader, might learn from its Head, that these sorrows were not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness. We read of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, a chief member in this body, and we hear him confessing that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was full of such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, when he says, that he feels <q>great heaviness and continual sorrow in heart for his brethren according to the flesh, who are <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>.</q>  And if we say that our Lord was sorrowful for them also at the approach of His Passion, in which they would incur the most atrocious guilt, I think we shall not speak amiss. Lastly, the very thing said by our Saviour on the Cross, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184084"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> is expressed in this Psalm below, <q>I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse4">Psalm 87:4</a></span>: by them who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what they were doing, when they imagined that He died like other men, subjected to necessity, and overcome by it. The word <q>pit</q> is used for the depth of woe or of Hell. <q>I have been as a man that has no help.</q></p>

<p>4. <q>Free among the dead</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse5">Psalm 87:5</a></span>. In these words our Lord's Person is most clearly shown: for who else is free among the dead but He who though in the likeness of sinful flesh is alone among sinners without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note184085"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3</a></span> ...He therefore, <q>free among the dead,</q> who had it in His power to lay down His life, and again to take it; from whom no one could take it, but He laid it down of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; who could revive His own flesh, as a temple destroyed by them, at His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; who, when all had forsaken Him on the eve of His Passion, remained not alone, because, as He testifies, His Father forsook Him not; <span class="stiki" id="note184086"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;8:29</a></span> was nevertheless by His enemies, for whom He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what they did, ...counted <q>as one who has no help; like them that are wounded, and lie in the grave.</q> But he adds, <q>Whom thou dost not yet remember:</q> and in these words there is to be remarked a distinction between Christ and the rest of the dead. For though He was wounded, and when dead laid in the tomb, <span class="stiki" id="note184087"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse50">Matthew&nbsp;27:50,&nbsp;60</a></span> yet they who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what they were doing, or who He was, regarded Him as like others who had perished from their wounds, and who slept in the tomb, who are as yet out of remembrance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, whose hour of resurrection has not yet arrived. For thus the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> speaks of the dead as sleeping, because it wishes them to be regarded as destined to awake, that is, to rise again. But He, wounded and asleep in the tomb, awoke on the third day, and became <q>like a sparrow that sits alone on the housetop,</q>  that is, on the right hand of His Father in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>: and now <q>dies no more, death shall no more have dominion over Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184089"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;6:9</a></span> Hence He differs widely from those whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not yet remembered to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> their resurrection after this manner: for what was to go before in the Head, was kept for the Body in the end. God is then said to remember, when He does an act: then to forget, when He does it not: for neither can God forget, as He never changes, nor remember, as He can never forget. <q>I am counted</q> then, by those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do, <q>as a man that has no help:</q> while I am <q>free among the dead,</q> I am held by these men <q>like them that are wounded, and lie in the grave.</q> Yet those very men, who account thus of Me, are further said to be <q>cut away from Your hand,</q> that is, when I was made so by them, <q>they were cut away from Your hand;</q> they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Me destitute of help, are deprived of the help of Your hand: for they, as he says in another Psalm,  have dug a pit before me, and are fallen into the midst of it themselves. I prefer this interpretation to that which refers the words, <q>they are cut away from Your hand,</q> to those who sleep in the tomb, whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not yet remembered: since the righteous are among the latter, of whom, even though God has not yet called them to the resurrection, it is said, that their <q><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are in the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184091"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;3:1</a></span> that is, that <q>they dwell under the defence of the Most High; and shall abide under the shadow of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q>  But it is those who are cut away from the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that Christ was cut off from His hand, and thus accounting Him among the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, dared to slay Him.</p>

<p>5. <q>They laid Me in the lowest pit</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse6">Psalm 87:6</a></span>, that is, the deepest pit. For so it is in the Greek. But what is the lowest pit, but the deepest woe, than which there is none more deep? Whence in another Psalm it is said, <q>You brought me out also of the pit of misery.</q>  <q>In a place of darkness, and in the shadow of death,</q> whiles they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what they did, they laid Him there, thus deeming of Him; they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not Him <q>whom none of the princes of this world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184094"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> By the <q>shadow of death,</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether the death of the body is to be understood, or that of which it is written, <q>That they walked in darkness and in the land of the shadow of death, a light is risen on them,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184095"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;9:2</a></span> because by belief they were brought from out of the darkness and death of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> into light and life. Such an one those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what they did thought our Lord, and in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> accounted Him among those whom He came to help, that they might not be such themselves.</p>

<p>6. <q>Your indignation lies hard upon Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse7">Psalm 87:7</a></span>, or, as other copies have it, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>;</q> or, as others, <q>Your fury:</q> the Greek word <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x1F78;&#x03C2;</span> having undergone different interpretations. For where the Greek copies have <span class="greek">&#x1F40;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x1F74;</span>, no translator hesitated to express it by the Latin <em>ira</em>; but where the word is <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x1F78;&#x03C2;</span>, most object to rendering it by <em>ira</em>, although many of the authors of the best Latin style, in their translations from Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, have thus rendered the word in Latin. But I shall not discuss this matter further: only if I also were to suggest another term, I should think <q>indignation</q> more tolerable than <q>fury,</q> this word in Latin not being applied to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in their senses. What then does this mean, <q>Your indignation lies hard upon Me,</q> except the belief of those, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the Lord of Glory? <span class="stiki" id="note184096"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> who imagined that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of God was not merely roused, but lay hard upon Him, whom they dared to bring to death, and not only death, but that kind, which they regarded as the most execrable of all, namely, the death of the Cross: whence says the Apostle, <q>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs upon a tree.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184097"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> On this account, wishing to praise His <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> which He carried to the extreme of humility, he says, <q>He humbled Himself, and became <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death;</q> and as this seemed little, he added, <q>even the death of the Cross;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184098"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> and with the same view as far as I can see, he says in this Psalm, <q>And all your suspensions,</q> or, as some translate <q>waves,</q> others <q>tossings,</q> <q>You have brought over Me.</q> We also find in another Psalm, <q>All your suspensions and waves have come in upon Me,</q>  or, as some have translated better, <q>have passed over Me:</q> for it is <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x1FC6;&#x03BB;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> in Greek, not <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C3;&#x1FC6;&#x03BB;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>: and where both expressions are employed, <q>waves</q> and <q>suspensions,</q> one cannot be used as equivalent to the other. In that passage we explained <q>suspensions</q> as threatenings, <q>waves</q> as the actual sufferings: both inflicted by God's judgment: but in that place it is said, <q>All have passed over Me,</q> here, <q>You have brought all upon Me.</q> In the other case, that is, although some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> took place, yet, he said, all those which are here mentioned passed over; but in this case, <q>You have brought them upon Me.</q> Evils pass over when they do not touch a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, as things which hang over him, or when they do touch him, as waves. But when he uses the word <q>suspensions,</q> he does not say they passed over, but, <q>You have brought them upon Me,</q> meaning that all which impended had come to pass. All things which were predicted of His Passion impended, as long as they remained in the prophecies for future fulfilment.</p>

<p>7. <q>You have put Mine acquaintance far from Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse8">Psalm 87:8</a></span>. If we understand by acquaintance those whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, it will be all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; for whom <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> He not? But He calls those acquaintance, to whom He was Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, as far as they could <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him at that season: at least so far forth as they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him to be innocent, although they considered Him only as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not as likewise God. Although He might call the righteous whom He approved, acquaintance, as He calls the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> unknown, to whom He was to say at the end, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184100"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;7:23</a></span> In what follows, <q>and they have set Me for an abhorrence to themselves;</q> those whom He called before <q>acquaintance,</q> may be meant, as even they felt horror at the mode of that death: but it is better referred to those of whom He was speaking above as His persecutors. <q>I was delivered up, and did not get forth.</q> Is this because His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were without, while He was being tried within? <span class="stiki" id="note184101"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse56">Matthew&nbsp;26:56</a></span> Or are we to give a deeper meaning to the words, <q>I cannot get forth</q> as signifying, <q>I remained hidden in My secret counsels, I showed not who I was, I did not reveal Myself, was not made manifest</q>? And so it follows&mdash;</p>

<p><q>My eyes became weak from want</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse9">Psalm 87:9</a></span>. For what eyes are we to understand? If the eyes of the flesh in which He suffered, we do not read that His eyes became weak from want, that is, from hunger, in His Passion, as is often the case; as He was betrayed after His Supper, and crucified on the same day: if the inner eyes, how were they weakened from want, in which there was a light that could never fail? But He meant by His eyes those members in the body, of which He was Himself the head, which, as brighter and more eminent and chief above the rest, He loved. It was of this body that the Apostle was speaking, when he wrote, taking his metaphor from our own body, <q>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?</q> etc. <span class="stiki" id="note184102"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:17-21</a></span> What he wished understood by these words, he has expressed more clearly, by adding, <q>Now you are the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and members in particular.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184103"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:27</a></span> Wherefore as those eyes, that is, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles, to whom not flesh and blood, but the Father which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> had revealed Him, so that Peter said, <q>You are Christ, the Son of the Living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184104"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;16:16</a></span> when they saw Him betrayed, and suffering such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, saw Him not such as they wished, as He did not come forth, did not manifest Himself in His <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and power, but still hidden in His secrecy,  endured everything as a man overcome and enfeebled, they became weak for want, as if their food, their Light, had been withdrawn from them.</p>

<p>8. He continues, <q>And I have called upon You.</q> This indeed He did most clearly, when upon the Cross. But what follows? <q>All the day I have stretched forth My hands unto You,</q> must be examined how it must be taken. For if in this expression we understand the tree of the Cross, how can we reconcile it with the <q>whole day</q>? Can He be said to have hung upon the Cross during the whole day, as the night is considered a part of the day? But if day, as opposed to night, was meant by this expression, even of this day, the first and no small portion had passed by at the time of His crucifixion. But if we take <q>day</q> in the same sense of time (especially as the word is used in the feminine, a gender which is restricted to that sense in Latin, although not so in Greek, as it is always used in the feminine, which I suppose to be the reason for its translation in the same gender in our own version), the knot of the question will be drawn tighter: for how can it mean for the whole space of time, if He did not even for one day stretch forth His hands on the Cross? Further, should we take the whole for a part, as Scripture sometimes uses this expression, I do not remember an instance in which the whole is taken for a part, when the word <q>whole</q> is expressly added. For in the passage of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> where the Lord says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> shall be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184106"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;12:40</a></span> it is no extraordinary licence to take the whole for the part, the expression not being for three <q>whole</q> days and three whole nights: since the one intermediate day was a whole one, the other two were parts, the last being part of the first day, the first part of the last. But if the Cross is not meant here, but the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which we find in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> that He poured forth in the form of a servant to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, where He is said to have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> long before His Passion, and on the eve of His Passion, and also when on the Cross, we do not read anywhere that He did so throughout the whole day. Therefore by the stretched-out hands throughout the whole day, we may understand the continuation of good works in which He never ceased from exertion.</p>

<p>9. But as His good works profited only the <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, nor even all those among whom they were done, he adds, <q>Do you show wonders among the dead?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse10">Psalm 87:10</a></span>. If we suppose this relates to those whose flesh life has left, great wonders have been wrought among the dead, inasmuch as some of them have revived: <span class="stiki" id="note184107"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse52">Matthew&nbsp;27:52</a></span> and in our Lord's descent into Hell, and His ascent as the conqueror of death, a great wonder was wrought among the dead. He refers then in these words, <q>Do You show wonders among the dead?</q> to men so dead in heart, that such great works of Christ could not rouse them to the life of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for he does not say that wonders are not shown to them because they see them not, but because they do not profit them. For, as he says in this passage, <q>the whole day have I stretched forth My hands to You:</q> because He ever refers all His works to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His Father, constantly declaring that He came to fulfil His Father's will: <span class="stiki" id="note184108"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;6:38</a></span> so also, as an unbelieving people saw the same works, another Prophet says, <q>I have spread out my hands all day unto a rebellious people, that believes not, but contradicts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184109"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;65:2</a></span> Those then are dead, to whom wonders have not been shown, not because they saw them not, but since they lived not again through them. The following verse, <q>Shall physicians revive them, and shall they praise You?</q> means, that the dead shall not be revived by such means, that they may praise You. In the Hebrew there is said to be a different expression: giants being used where physicians are here: but the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> translators, whose authority is such that they may deservedly be said to have interpreted by the inspiration of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> owing to their wonderful agreement, conclude, not by mistake, but taking occasion from the resemblance in sound between the Hebrew words expressing these two senses, that the use of the word is an indication of the sense in which the word giants is meant to be taken. For if you suppose the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> meant by giants, of whom the Apostle says, <q>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this world?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184110"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:20</a></span> there is no incongruity in calling them physicians, as if by their own unaided skill they promised the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: against whom it is said, <q>Of the Lord is safety.</q>  But if we take the word giant in a good sense, as it is said of our Lord, <q>He rejoices as a giant to run his course;</q>  that is Giant of giants, chief among the greatest and strongest, who in His Church excel in spiritual strength. Just as He is the Mountain of mountains; as it is written, <q>And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be manifested in the top of the mountains:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184113"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;2:2</a></span> and the Saint of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>: there is no absurdity in styling these same great and mighty men physicians. Whence says the Apostle, <q>if by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184114"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;11:14</a></span> But even such physicians, even though they cure not by their own power (as not even of their own do those of the body), yet so far forth as by faithful ministry they assist towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, can cure the living, but not raise the dead: of whom it is said, <q>Do You show wonders among the dead?</q> For the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by which men's minds in a certain manner are brought to live a fresh life, so as to be able to hear the lessons of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> from any of its ministers whatever, is most hidden and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a>. This <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is thus spoken of in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>No man can come to Me, except the Father which has sent Me draw him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184115"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;6:44</a></span> ...in order to show, that the very <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> believes, and springs into fresh life from the death of its former affections, is given us by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whatever exertions, then, the best preachers of the word,  and persuaders of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, may make with men, just like great physicians: yet if they are dead, and through Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> have not a second life, <q>Do You show wonders among the dead, or shall physicians raise them? And shall they</q> whom they raise <q>praise You</q>? For this confession declares that they live: not, as it is written elsewhere, <q>Thanksgiving perishes from the dead, as from one that is not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184117"><a href="../bible/sir027.htm#verse26">Sirach&nbsp;17:26</a></span> </p>

<p>10. <q>Shall one show Your loving-kindness in the grave, or Your faithfulness in destruction?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse11">Psalm 87:11</a></span>. The word <q>show</q> is of course understood as if repeated, Shall any show Your faithfulness in destruction? Scripture loves to connect loving-kindness and faithfulness, especially in the Psalms. <q>Destruction</q> also is a repetition of <q>the grave,</q> and signifies them who are in the grave, styled above <q>the dead,</q> in the verse, <q>Do you show wonders among the dead?</q> for the body is the grave of the dead <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; whence our Lord's words in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>You are like whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but within are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184118"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;23:27-28</a></span> </p>

<p>11. <q>Shall your wondrous works be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the dark, and your righteousness in the land where all things are forgotten?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse12">Psalm 87:12</a></span>, the dark answers to the land of forgetfulness: for the unbelieving are meant by the dark, as the Apostle says, <q>For you were sometimes darkness;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184119"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> and the land where all things are forgotten, is the man who has forgotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can arrive at darkness so intense, <q>that the fool says in his heart, There is no God.</q>  Thus the meaning of the whole passage may thus be drawn out in its connection: <q>Lord, I have called upon You,</q> amid My sufferings; <q>all day I have stretched forth my hands unto You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse13">Psalm 87:13</a></span>. I have never ceased to stretch forth My works to glorify You. Why then do the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> rage against Me, unless because <q>Thou showest not wonders among the dead</q>? Because those wonders move them not to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor can physicians restore them to life that they may praise You, because Your hidden <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> works not in them to draw them unto believing: because no man comes unto Me, but whom You have drawn. Shall then <q>Your loving-kindness be showed in the grave</q>? That is, the grave of the dead <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which lies dead beneath the body's weight: <q>or Your faithfulness in destruction</q>? That is, in such a death as cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or feel any of these things. <q>For how then in the darkness</q> of this death, that is, in the man who in forgetting You has lost the light of his life, <q>shall Your wondrous works and Your righteousness be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q>...</p>

<p>12. But that those <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the blessings of which surpass all words, may be more fervent and more constant, the gift that shall last unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is deferred, while transitory <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are allowed to thicken. And so it follows: <q>Lord, why have You cast off my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse14">Psalm 87:14</a></span>, which may be compared with another Psalm:  <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, look upon me; why have You forsaken me?</q> The reason is made matter of question, not as if the wisdom of God were blamed as doing so without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; and so here. <q>Lord, why have You cast off my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>?</q> But if this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> be attended to carefully, it will be found indicated above; for it is with the view that the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the Saints are, as it were, repelled by the delay of so great a blessing, and by the adversity they encounter in the troubles of life, that the flame, thus fanned, may burst into a brighter blaze.</p>

<p>13. For this purpose he briefly sketches in what follows the troubles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body. For it is not in the Head alone that they took place, since it is said to Saul too, <q>Why do you persecute Me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184122"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself, as if placed as an elect member in the same body, says, <q>That I may fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184123"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse24">Colossians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> <q>Why then, Lord, have You cast off my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Why hidest Thou Your face from me?</q></p>

<p><q>I am poor, and in toils from my youth up: and when lifted up, I was thrown down, and troubled</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse15">Psalm 87:15</a></span>.</p>

<p><q>Your wraths went over me: Your terrors disturbed me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse16">Psalm 87:16</a></span>.</p>

<p><q>They came round about me all day like water: they compassed me about together</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse17">Psalm 87:17</a></span>.</p>

<p><q>A friend You have put far from me: and mine acquaintance from my misery</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa087.htm#verse18">Psalm 87:18</a></span>. All these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> have taken place, and are happening in the limbs of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, and God turns away His face from their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, by not hearing as to what they wish for, since they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that the fulfilment of their wishes would not be good for them. The Church is <q>poor,</q> as she hungers and thirsts in her wanderings for that food with which she shall be filled in her own country: she is <q>in toils from her youth up,</q> as the very Body of Christ says in another Psalm, <q>Many a time have they overcome me from my youth.</q>  And for this reason some of her members are lifted up even in this world, that in them may be the greater lowliness. Over that Body, which constitutes the unity of the Saints and the faithful, whose Head is Christ, go the wraths of God: yet abide not: since it is of the unbelieving only that it is written, that <q>the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God abides upon him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184125"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;3:36</a></span> The terrors of God disturb the weakness of the faithful, because all that can happen, even though it actually happen not, it is <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and sometimes these terrors so agitate the reflecting <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> impending around, that they seem to flow around us on every side like water, and to encircle us in our fears. And as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> while on pilgrimage is never free from these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, happening as they do at one moment in one of her limbs, at another in another, he adds, <q>all day,</q> signifying the continuation in time, to the end of this world. Often too, friends and acquaintances, their worldly interests at stake, in their terror forsake the Saints; of which says the Apostle, <q>all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184126"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:16</a></span> But to what purpose is all this, but that early in the morning, that is, after the night of unbelief, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Body may in the light of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> prevent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, until the coming of that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which we are at present saved by hoping for, not by having, while we await it with patience and faithfulness. Then the Lord will not repel our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, as there will no longer be anything to be sought for, but everything that has been rightly asked, will be obtained: nor will He turn His face away from us, since we shall see Him as He is: <span class="stiki" id="note184127"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> nor shall we be poor, because God will be our abundance, all in all: <span class="stiki" id="note184128"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:28</a></span> nor shall we suffer, as there will be no more weakness: nor after exaltation shall we meet with humiliation and confusion, as there will be no adversity there: nor bear even the transient <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as we shall abide in His abiding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: nor will His terrors agitate us, because His promises realized will bless us: nor will our friend and acquaintance, being terrified, be far from us, where there will be no foe to dread.</p>
