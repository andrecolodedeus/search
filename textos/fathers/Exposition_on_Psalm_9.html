<h1>Exposition on Psalm 9</h1>

<p>1. The inscription of this Psalm is, <q>To the end for the hidden things of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, a Psalm of David himself.</q>  As to the hidden things of the Son there may be a question: but since he has not added whose, the very only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should be understood. For where a Psalm has been inscribed of the son of David,  <q>When,</q> he says, <q>he fled from the face of Absalom his son;</q> although his name even was mentioned, and therefore there could be no obscurity as to whom it was spoken of: yet it is not merely said, from the face of son Absalom; but <q>his</q> is added. But here both because <q>his</q> is not added, and much is said of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, it cannot properly be taken of Absalom. <span class="stiki" id="note180328"><a href="../bible/2sa015.htm">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;xv</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which that abandoned one waged with his father, no way relates to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, since there the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> only were divided against themselves. This Psalm is then sung for the hidden things of the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.  For the Lord Himself too, when, without addition, He uses the word Son, would have Himself, the Only-begotten to be understood; as where He says, <q>If the Son shall make you free, then shall you be free indeed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180330"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse36">John&nbsp;8:36</a></span> For He said not, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; but in saying merely, Son, He gives us to understand whose Son it is. Which form of expression nothing admits of, save His excellency of whom we so speak, that, though we name Him not, He can be understood. For so we say, it rains, clears up, thunders, and such like expressions; and we do not add who does it all; for that the excellency of the doer spontaneously presents itself to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> minds, and does not want words. What then are the hidden things of the Son? By which expression we must first understand that there are some things of the Son manifest, from which those are distinguished which are called hidden. Wherefore since we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> two advents of the Lord, one past, which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> understood not: the other future, which we both hope for; and since the one which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> understood not, profited the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; <q>For the hidden things of the Son</q> is not unsuitably understood to be spoken of this advent, in which <q>blindness in part is happened to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might come in.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180331"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;11:25</a></span> </p>

<p>For notice of two judgments is conveyed to us throughout the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, if any one will give heed to them, one hidden, the other manifest. The hidden one is passing now, of which the Apostle Peter says, <q>The time has come that judgment should begin from the house of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180332"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:17</a></span> The hidden judgment accordingly is the pain, by which now each man is either exercised to purification, or warned to conversion, or if he despise the calling and discipline of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is blinded unto damnation. But the manifest judgment is that in which the Lord, at His coming, will judge the quick and the dead, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> confessing that it is He by whom both rewards shall be assigned to the good, and punishments to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But then that confession will avail, not to the remedy of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, but to the accumulation of damnation. Of these two judgments, the one hidden, the other manifest, the Lord seems to me to have spoken, where He says, <q>Whoso <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me has passed from death unto life, and shall not come into judgment;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180333"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;5:24</a></span> into the manifest judgment, that is. For that which passes from death unto life by means of some affliction, whereby <q>He scourges every son whom He receives,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180334"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6</a></span> is the hidden judgment. <q>But whoso <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not,</q> says He, <q>has been judged already:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180335"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;3:18</a></span> that is, by this hidden judgment has been already prepared for that manifest one. These two judgments we read of also in Wisdom, whence it is written, <q>Therefore unto them, as to children without the use of reason, You gave a judgment to mock them; But they that have not been corrected by this judgment have felt a judgment worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180336"><a href="../bible/wis012.htm#verse25">Wisdom&nbsp;12:25-26</a></span> Whoso then are not corrected by this hidden judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall most worthily be punished by that manifest one....</p>

<p>2. <q>I will confess unto You, O Lord, with my whole heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse1">Psalm 9:1</a></span>. He does not, with a whole heart, confess unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubts</a> of His Providence in any particular: but he who sees already the hidden things of the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how great is His invisible reward, who says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in tribulations;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180337"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;5:3</a></span> and how all torments, which are inflicted on the body, are either for the exercising of those that are converted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or for warning that they be converted, or for just preparation of the obdurate unto their last damnation: and so now all things are referred to the governance of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, which fools think done as it were by chance and at random, and without any Divine ordering. <q>I will tell all Your marvels.</q> He tells all God's marvels, who sees them performed not only openly on the body, but invisibly indeed too in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but far more sublimely and excellently. For men earthly, and led wholly by the eye, marvel more that the dead Lazarus rose again in the body, than that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the persecutor rose again in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  But since the visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> calls the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the light, but the invisible enlightens the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that comes when called, he tells all God's marvels, who, by believing the visible, passes on to the understanding of the invisible.</p>

<p>3. <q>I will be glad and exult in You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse2">Psalm 9:2</a></span>. Not any more in this world, not in pleasure of bodily dalliance, not in relish of palate and tongue, not in sweetness of perfumes, not in joyousness of passing sounds, not in the variously coloured forms of figure, not in vanities of men's praise, not in wedlock and perishable offspring, not in superfluity of temporal <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, not in this world's getting, whether it extend over place and space, or be prolonged in time's succession: but, <q>I will be glad and exult in You,</q> namely, in the hidden things of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, where <q>the light of Your countenance has been stamped on us, O Lord:</q>  for, <q>You will hide them,</q> says he, <q>in the hiding place of Your countenance.</q>  He then will be glad and exult in You, who tells all Your marvels. And He will tell all Your marvels (since it is now spoken of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>), <q>who came not to do His own will, but the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who sent Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180341"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;6:38</a></span> </p>

<p>4. For now the Person of the Lord begins to appear speaking in this Psalm. For it follows, <q>I will sing to Your Name, O Most High, in turning mine enemy behind.</q> His enemy then, where was he turned back? Was it when it was said to him, <q>Get behind, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note180342"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;16:23</a></span> For then he who by tempting desired to put himself before, was turned behind, by failing in deceiving Him who was tempted, and by availing nothing against Him. For earthly men are behind: but the heavenly man is preferred before, although he came after. For <q>the first man is of the earth, earthy: the second Man is from heaven, heavenly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180343"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse47">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:47</a></span> But from this stock he came by whom it was said, <q>He who comes after me is preferred before me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180344"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;1:15</a></span> And the Apostle forgets <q>those things that are behind, and reaches forth unto those things that are before.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180345"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> The enemy, therefore, was turned behind, after that he could not deceive the heavenly Man being tempted; and he turned himself to earthy men, where he can have dominion....For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is turned behind, even in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the righteous, and he, much more to their advantage, is a persecutor, than if he went before as a leader and a prince. We must sing then to the Name of the Most High in turning the enemy behind: since we ought to choose rather to fly from him as a persecutor, than to follow him as a leader. For we have whither we may fly and hide ourselves in the hidden things of the Son; seeing that <q>the Lord has been made a refuge for us.</q> </p>

<p>5. <q>They will be weakened, and perish from Your face</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse3">Psalm 9:3</a></span>. Who will be weakened and perish, but the unrighteous and ungodly? <q>They will be weakened,</q> while they shall avail nothing; <q>and they shall perish,</q> because the ungodly will not be; <q>from the face</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is, from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he perished who said, <q>But now I live not, but Christ lives in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180347"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> But why will the ungodly <q>be weakened and perish from your face?</q> <q>Because,</q> he says, <q>You have made my judgment, and my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>:</q> that is, the judgment in which I seemed to be judged, You have made mine; and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in which men condemned me just and innocent, You have made mine. For such things served  Him for our deliverance: as sailors too call the wind theirs, which they take advantage of for prosperous sailing.</p>

<p>6. <q>You  sat on the throne Who judgest equity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse4">Psalm 9:4</a></span>. Whether the Son say this to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who said also, <q>You could have no power against Me, except it were given you from above,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180349"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;19:11</a></span> referring this very thing, that the Judge of men was judged for men's advantage, to the Father's equity and His own hidden things: or whether man say to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>You  sat on the throne Who judgest equity,</q> giving the name of God's throne to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that his body may perhaps be the earth, which is called God's <q>footstool:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180350"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;66:1</a></span> for <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, reconciling the world unto Himself:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180351"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:19</a></span> or whether the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, perfect now and without spot and wrinkle, <span class="stiki" id="note180352"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> worthy, that is, of the hidden things of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in that <q>the King has brought her into His chamber,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180353"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse4">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:4</a></span> say to her spouse, <q>You  sat upon the throne Who judgest equity,</q> in that You have risen from the dead, and ascended up into heaven, and sittest at the right hand of the Father: whichsoever, I say, of those opinions, whereunto this verse may be referred, is preferred, it transgresses not the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>7. <q>You have rebuked the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and the ungodly has perished</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse5">Psalm 9:5</a></span>. We take this to be more suitably said to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, than said by Him. For who else has rebuked the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and the ungodly perished, save He, who after that He ascended up into heaven, sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that, filled by Him, the Apostles should preach the word of God with boldness, and freely reprove men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? At which rebuke the ungodly perished; because the ungodly was justified and was made godly. You have effaced their name for the world,  and for the world's world. The name of the ungodly has been effaced. For they are not called ungodly who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Now their name is effaced <q>for the world,</q> that is, as long as the course of the temporal world endures. <q>And for the world's world.</q> What is <q>the world's world,</q> but that whose image and shadow, as it were, this world possesses? For the change of seasons succeeding one another, while the moon is on the wane, and again on the increase, while the sun each year returns to his quarter, while spring, or summer, or autumn, or winter passes away only to return, is in some sort an imitation of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But this world's world is that which abides in immutable <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. As a verse in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and a verse in the voice, the former is understood, the latter heard; and the former fashions the latter; and hence the former works in art and abides, the latter sounds in the air and passes away. So the fashion of this changeable world is defined by that world unchangeable which is called the world's world. And hence the one abides in the art, that is, in the Wisdom and Power of God: but the other is made to pass in the governance of creation. If after all it be not a repetition, so that after it was said <q>for the world,</q> lest it should be understood of this world that passes away, it were added <q>for the world's world.</q> For in the Greek copies it is thus, <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03B1;&#x1F30;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03B1;&#x1F30;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;&#x03B1; &#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03B1;&#x1F30;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> Which the Latins have for the most rendered, not, <q>for the world, and for the world's world;</q>  but, <q>for ever, and for the world's world,</q>  that in the words <q>for the world's world.</q> the, words <q>for ever,</q> should be explained. <q>The name,</q> then, <q>of the ungodly You have effaced for ever,</q> for from henceforth the ungodly shall never be. And if their name be not prolonged unto this world, much less unto the world's world. </p>

<p>8. <q>The swords of the enemy have failed at the end</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse6">Psalm 9:6</a></span>. Not enemies in the plural, but this enemy in the singular. Now what enemy's swords have failed but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a>? Now these are understood to be various erroneous opinions, whereby as with swords he destroys <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. In overcoming these swords, and in bringing them to failure, that sword is employed, of which it is said in the seventh Psalm, <q>If you be not converted, He will brandish His sword.</q>  And perhaps this is the end, against which the swords of the enemy fail; since up to it they are of some avail. Now it works secretly, but in the last judgment it will be brandished openly. By it the cities are destroyed. For so it follows, <q>The swords of the enemy have failed at the end: and You have destroyed the cities.</q> Cities indeed wherein the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> rules, where crafty and deceitful counsels hold, as it were, the place of a court, on which supremacy attend as officers and ministers the services of all the members, the eyes for curiosity, the ears for lasciviousness, or for whatsoever else is gladly listened to that bears on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the hands for rapine or any other <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> or pollution soever, and all the other members after this manner serving the tyrannical supremacy, that is, perverse counsels. Of this city the commonalty, as it were, are all soft affections and disturbing emotions of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, stirring up daily seditions in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. So then where a king, where a court, where ministers, where commonalty are found, there is a city. Now again would such things be in bad cities, unless they were first in individual men, who are, as it were, the elements and seeds of cities. These cities He destroys, when on the prince being shut out thence, of whom it was said, <q>The prince of this world</q> has been <q>cast out,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180359"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;12:31</a></span> these kingdoms are wasted by the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsels are laid to sleep, vile affections tamed, the ministries of the members and senses taken captive, and transferred to the service of righteousness and good works: that as the Apostle says, <q>Sin should no more reign in</q> our <q>mortal body,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180360"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;6:12</a></span> and so forth. Then is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at peace, and the man is disposed to receive rest and blessedness. <q>Their memorial has perished with uproar:</q> with the uproar, that is, of the ungodly. But it is said, <q>with uproar,</q> either because when ungodliness is overturned, there is uproar made: for none passes to the highest place, where there is the deepest silence, but he who with much uproar shall first have warred with his own <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>: or <q>with uproar,</q> is said, that the memory of the ungodly should perish in the perishing even of the very uproar, in which ungodliness riots.</p>

<p>9. <q>And the Lord abides for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse7">Psalm 9:7</a></span>. <q>Wherefore</q> then <q>have the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> raged, and the people imagined vain things against the Lord, and against His anointed:</q>  for <q>the Lord abides for ever. He has prepared His seat in judgment, and He shall judge the world in equity.</q> He prepared His seat when He was judged. For by that patience Man purchased heaven, and God in Man profited <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. And this is the Son's hidden judgment. But seeing He is also to come openly and in the sight of all to judge the quick and the dead, He has prepared His seat in the hidden judgment: and He shall also openly <q>judge the world in equity:</q> that is, He shall distribute gifts proportioned to desert, setting the sheep on His right hand, and the goats on His left. <span class="stiki" id="note180362"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;25:33</a></span> <q>He shall judge the people with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse8">Psalm 9:8</a></span>. This is the same as was said above, <q>He shall judge the world in equity.</q> Not as men judge who see not the heart, by whom very often worse men are acquitted than are condemned: but <q>in equity</q> and <q>with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a></q> shall the Lord judge, <q><a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and thoughts accusing, or else excusing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180363"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;2:15</a></span> </p>

<p>10. <q>And the Lord has become a refuge to the poor</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse9">Psalm 9:9</a></span>. Whatsoever be the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of that enemy, who has been turned behind, what harm shall he do to them whose refuge the Lord has become? But this will be, if in this world, in which that one has an office of power, they shall choose to be poor, by loving nothing which either here leaves a man while he lives and loves, or is left by him when he dies. For to such a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man has the Lord become a refuge, <q>an Helper in due season, in tribulation.</q> Lo, He makes poor, for <q>He scourges every son whom He receives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180364"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6</a></span> For what <q>an Helper in due season</q> is, he explained by adding <q>in tribulation.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save when it is turned away from this world: nor is it more seasonably turned away from this world, except toils and pains be mingled with its trifling and hurtful and destructive pleasures.</p>

<p>11. <q>And let them who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Your Name, hope in You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse10">Psalm 9:10</a></span>, when they shall have ceased hoping in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and in the other enticements of this world. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> indeed that seeks where to fix her hope, when she is torn away from this world, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God's Name seasonably receives. For the mere Name of God has now been published everywhere: but the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the name is, when He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> whose name it is. For the name is not a name for its own sake, but for that which it signifies. Now it has been said, <q>The Lord is His Name.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180365"><a href="../bible/jer033.htm#verse2">Jeremiah&nbsp;33:2</a></span> Wherefore whoso willingly submits himself to God as His servant, has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> this name. <q>And let them who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Your Name hope in You</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse10">Psalm 9:10</a></span>. Again, the Lord says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>I am That I am; and You shall say to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, <em>I Am</em>, has sent me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180366"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> <q>Let them</q> then <q>who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Your Name, hope in You;</q> that they may not hope in those things which flow by in time's quick revolution, having nothing but <q>will be</q> and <q>has been.</q> For what in them is future, when it arrives, straightway becomes the past; it is awaited with eagerness, it is lost with pain. But in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God nothing will be, as if it were not yet; or has been, as if it were no longer: but there is only that which is, and this is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. Let them cease then to hope in and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> things temporal, and let them apply themselves to hope <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His name who said, <q>I am That I am;</q> and of whom it was said, <q> <em>I Am</em> has sent me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180367"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> <q>For You have not forsaken them that seek You, O Lord.</q> Whoso seek Him, seek no more things transient and perishable; <q>For no man can serve two masters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180368"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> </p>

<p>12. <q>Sing to the Lord, who dwells in Sion</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse11">Psalm 9:11</a></span>, is said to them, whom the Lord forsakes not as they seek Him. He dwells in Sion, which is interpreted watching, and which bears the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that now is; as Jerusalem bears the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that is to come, that is, the city of Saints already enjoying life angelical; for Jerusalem is by interpretation the vision of peace.  Now watching goes before vision, as this Church goes before that one which is promised, the city <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. But in time it goes before, not in dignity: because more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> is that whither we are striving to arrive, than what we practise, that we may attain to arrive; now we practise watching, that we may arrive at vision. But again this same Church which now is, unless the Lord inhabit her, the most earnest watching might run into any sort of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And to this Church it was said, <q>For the temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, which temple you are:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180370"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> again, <q>that Christ may dwell in the inner man in your hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180371"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> It is enjoined us then, that we sing to the Lord who dwells in Sion, that with one accord we praise the Lord, the Inhabitant of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <q>Show forth His wonders among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>.</q> It has both been done, and will not cease to be done.</p>

<p>13. <q>For requiring their blood He has remembered</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse12">Psalm 9:12</a></span>. As if they, who were sent to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, should make answer to that injunction which has been mentioned, <q>Show forth His wonders among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>,</q> and should say, <q>O Lord, who has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> our report?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180372"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;53:1</a></span> and again, <q>For Your sake we are killed all the day long;</q>  the Psalmist suitably goes on to say, That <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> not without great reward of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> will die in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, <q>for requiring their blood He has remembered.</q> But why did he choose to say, <q>their blood</q>? Was it, as if one of imperfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and less <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should ask, How will they <q>show them forth,</q> seeing that the infidelity of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> will rage against them; and he should be answered, <q>For requiring their blood He has remembered,</q> that is, the last judgment will come, in which both the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the slain and the punishment of the slayers shall be made manifest? But let no one suppose <q>He has remembered</q> to be so used, as though forgetfulness can attach to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but since the judgment will be after a long interval, it is used in accordance with the feeling of weak men, who think God has forgotten, because He does not act so speedily as they wish. To such is said what follows also, <q>He has not forgotten the cry of the poor:</q> that is, He has not, as you suppose, forgotten. As if they should on hearing, <q>He has remembered,</q> say, Then He had forgotten; No, <q>He has not forgotten,</q> says the Psalmist, <q>the cry of the poor.</q></p>

<p>14. But I ask, what is that cry of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forgets not? Is it that cry, the words whereof are these, <q>Pity me, O Lord, see my humiliation at the hands of my enemies</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse13">Psalm 9:13</a></span>. Why then did he not say, Pity <q>us</q> O Lord, see our humiliation at the hands of <q>our</q> enemies, as if many poor were crying; but as if one, Pity <q>me,</q> O Lord? Is it because One intercedes for the Saints, <q>who</q> first <q>for our sakes became poor, though He was rich;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180374"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:9</a></span> and it is He who says, <q>Who exaltest me from the gates of death <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse14">Psalm 9:14</a></span>, that I may declare all Your praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion</q>? For man is exalted in Him, not that Man only which He bears, which is the Head of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but whichsoever one of us also is among the other members, and is exalted from all depraved desires; which are the gates of death, for that through them is the road to death. But the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the fruition is at once death itself, when one gains what he has in abandoned wilfulness <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a>: for <q><a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180375"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:10</a></span> and therefore is the gate of death, for <q>the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> that lives in pleasures is dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180376"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:6</a></span> At which pleasures we arrive through desires as it were through the gates of death. But all highest purposes are the gates of the daughter of Sion, through which we come to the vision of peace in the Holy Church....Or haply are the gates of death the bodily senses and eyes, which were opened when the man tasted of the forbidden tree, <span class="stiki" id="note180377"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> ... and are the gates of the daughter of Sion the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and beginnings of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which are opened to them that knock, that they may arrive at the hidden things of the Son?...</p>

<p>15. Then follows, <q>I will exult for Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>:</q> that is, with blessedness shall I be holden by Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Power and Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore says the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is here in affliction and is saved by hope, as long as the hidden judgment of the Son is, in hope she says, <q>I will exult for Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>:</q> for now she is worn down either by the roar of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> around her, or by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. <q>The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are fixed in the corruption, which they made</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse15">Psalm 9:15</a></span>. Consider ye how punishment is reserved for the sinner, out of his own works; and how they that have wished to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, have been fixed in that corruption, which they thought to inflict. For they were desiring to kill the body, while they themselves were dying in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <q>In that snare which they hid, has their foot been taken.</q> The hidden snare is crafty devising. The foot of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is well understood to be its <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: which, when depraved, is called <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> or <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; but when upright, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or charity....And the Apostle says, <q>That being rooted and grounded in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, you may be able to take in.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180378"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;3:17-18</a></span> The foot then of sinners, that is, their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, is taken in the snare, which they hide: for when delight shall have followed on to deceitful dealing, when God shall have delivered them over to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of their heart; that delight at once binds them, that they dare not tear away their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thence and apply it to profitable objects; for when they shall make the attempt, they will be pained in heart, as if desiring to free their foot from a fetter: and giving way under this pain they refuse to withdraw from pernicious delights. <q>In the snare</q> then <q>which they have hid,</q> that is, in deceitful counsel, <q>their foot has been taken,</q> that is, their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which through deceit attains to that vain <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> whereby pain is purchased.</p>

<p>16. <q>The Lord is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> executing judgments</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse16">Psalm 9:16</a></span>. These are God's judgments. Not from that tranquillity of His blessedness, nor from the secret places of wisdom, wherein blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are received, is the sword, or fire, or wild beast, or any such thing brought forth, whereby sinners may be tormented: but how are they tormented, and how does the Lord do judgment? <q>In the works,</q> he says, <q>of his own hands has the sinner been caught.</q></p>

<p>17. Here is interposed, <q>The song of the diapsalma</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse16">Psalm 9:16</a></span>: as it were the hidden <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, as far as we can <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, of the separation which is now made, not in place, but in the affections of the heart, between sinners and the righteous, as of the grain from the chaff, as yet on the floor. And then follows, <q>Let the sinners be turned into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse17">Psalm 9:17</a></span>: that is, let them be given into their own hands, when they are spared, and let them be ensnared in deadly delight. <q>All the nations that forget God.</q> Because <q>when they did not think good to retain God in their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, God gave them over to a reprobate mind.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180379"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;1:28</a></span> </p>

<p>18. <q>For there shall not be forgetfulness of the poor man to the end</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse18">Psalm 9:18</a></span>; who now seems to be in forgetfulness, when sinners are thought to flourish in this world's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, and the righteous to be in travail: but <q>the patience,</q> says He, <q>of the poor shall not perish for ever.</q> Wherefore there is need of patience now to bear with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, who are already separated in will, till they be also separated at the last judgment.</p>

<p>19. <q>Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse19">Psalm 9:19</a></span>. The future judgment is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for: but before it come, <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>,</q> says he, <q>be judged in Your sight:</q> that is, in secret; which is called in God's sight, with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of a few <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and righteous ones. <q>Place a lawgiver over them, O Lord.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse20">Psalm 9:20</a></span>. He seems to me to point out <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>: of whom the Apostle says, <q>When the man of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall be revealed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note180380"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:3</a></span> <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are men.</q> That they who will be set free by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and belong to the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and be sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that is, new men, may serve man, that is, the old man the sinner, <q>for that they are men.</q></p>

<p>20. And because it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he is to arrive at so great a pitch of empty <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and he will be permitted to do so great things, both against all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and against the Saints of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that then some weak ones shall indeed think that God cares not for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs, the Psalmist interposing a diapsalma, adds as it were the voice of men groaning and asking why judgment is deferred. </p>
