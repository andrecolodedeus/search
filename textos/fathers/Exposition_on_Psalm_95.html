<h1>Exposition on Psalm 95</h1>


<p>1. I could wish, brethren, that we were rather listening to our father: but even this is a good thing, to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> our father. Since therefore he who deigns to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, has ordered us, I will speak unto you, beloved, what from the present Psalm <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our common Lord shall deign to give us. Now the title of the Psalm is <q>David's Song of praise.</q> The <q>Song of praise</q> signifies both cheerfulness, in that it is a song; and devotion, for it is praise. For what ought a man to praise more than that which pleases him so, that it is impossible that it can displease him? In the praising of God therefore we praise with security. There he who praises is safe, where he fears not lest he be ashamed for the object of his praise. Let us therefore both praise and sing; that is, let us praise with cheerfulness and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. But what we are about to praise, this Psalm in the following verses shows us.</p>

<p>2. <q>O come, let us sing unto the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse1">Psalm 94:1</a></span>. He calls us to a great banquet of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, not one of this world, but in the Lord. For if there were not in this life a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is to be distinguished from a righteous <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, it would be enough to say, <q>Come, let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>;</q> but he has briefly distinguished it. What is it to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> aright? To <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord. You should piously <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, if you dost wish safely to trample upon the world. But what is the word, <q>Come</q>? Whence does He call them to come, with whom he wishes to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord; except that, while they are afar, they may by coming draw nearer, by drawing nearer they may approach, and by approaching <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>? But whence are they afar? Can a man be locally distant from Him who is everywhere?...It is not by place, but by being unlike Him, that a man is afar from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What is to be unlike Him? It means, a bad life, bad habits; for if by good habits we approach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by bad habits we recede from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>....If therefore by unlikeness we recede from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by likeness we approach unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What likeness? That after which we were created, which by sinning we had corrupted in ourselves, which we have received again through the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is renewed in us in the mind within, that it may be engraved a second time as if on coin, that is, the image of our God upon our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that we may return to His treasures....</p>

<p>3. <q>Let us make a joyful  noise unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q>...Consider, beloved, those who make a joyful noise in any ordinary songs, as in a sort of competition of worldly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; and you see them while reciting the written lines bursting forth with a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that the tongue suffices not to express the measure of; how they shout, indicating by that utterance the feeling of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which cannot in words express what is conceived in the heart. If they then in earthly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> make a joyful noise; might we not do so from heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> we cannot express in words?</p>

<p>4. <q>Let us prevent His face by confession</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse2">Psalm 94:2</a></span>. Confession has a double meaning in Scripture. There is a confession of him who praises, there is that of him who groans. The confession of praise pertains to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Him who is praised: the confession of groaning to the repentance of him who confesses. For men confess when they praise God: they confess when they accuse themselves; and the tongue has no more worthy use. Truly, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these to be the very vows, of which he speaks in another Psalm: <q>I will pay You my vows, which I distinguished with my lips.</q>  Nothing is more elevated than that distinguishing, nothing is so necessary both to understand and to do. How then do you distinguish the vows which you pay unto God? By praising Him, by accusing yourself; because it is His mercy, to forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For if He chose to deal with us after our deserts, He would find <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> only to condemn. <q>O come,</q> he said therefore, that we may at last go back from our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and that He may not cast up with us our accounts for the past; but that as it were a new account may be commenced, all the bonds of our debts having been burnt....The more therefore you despaired of yourself on account of your iniquities, do thou confess your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for so much greater is the praise of Him who forgives, as is the fullness of the penitent's confession more abundant. Let us not therefore <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that we have receded from the song of praise, in understanding here that confession by which we acknowledge our transgressions: this is even a part of the song of praise; for when we confess our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, we praise the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>5. <q>And make a joyful  noise unto Him with Psalms.</q> We have already said what it is <q>to make a joyful noise:</q> the word is repeated, that it may be confirmed by the act: the very repetition is an exhortation. For we have not forgotten, so as to wish to be again admonished what was said above, that we should make a joyful noise: but usually in passages of strong feeling a well-known word is repeated, not to make it more familiar, but that the very repetition may strengthen the impression made: for it is repeated that we may understand the feeling of the speaker....Hear now: <q>For the Lord is a great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a great King above all gods</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse3">Psalm 94:3</a></span> <q>For the Lord will not cast off His people.</q>  Praise be unto Him, and shouts of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> be unto Him! What people shall He not cast off? We have no right to make our own explanation here: for the Apostle has prescribed this unto us, he has explained whereof it is said. For this was the Jewish people, the people where were the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the people where were the patriarchs, the people begotten according to the flesh from the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; the people in which all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> which promised our Saviour preceded us; the people among whom was instituted the temple, the anointing, the Priest for a figure, that when all these shadows were past, the Light itself might come; this therefore was the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to it were the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> sent, in it those who were sent were born; to it were delivered and entrusted the revelations of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What then? Is the whole of that people condemned? Far be it. It is called the good olive-tree by the Apostle, for it commenced with the patriarchs....This then is the tree itself: though some of its boughs have been broken, yet all have not. For if all the boughs were broken, whence is Peter? Whence John? Whence Thomas? Whence Matthew? Whence Andrew? Whence are all those Apostles? Whence that very <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> who was speaking to us but now, and by his own fruit bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the good olive? Were not all these of that people? Whence also those five hundred brethren to whom our Lord appeared after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note184397"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:6</a></span> Whence were so many thousands at the words of Peter (when the Apostles, filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, spoke with the tongues of all nations <span class="stiki" id="note184398"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;2:4</a></span>) converted with such <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their own accusation, that they who first shed the Lord's blood in their rage, learned how to drink it now that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? And all these five thousand were so converted that they sold their own property, and laid the price of it at the Apostles' feet.  That which one rich man did not do, when he heard from the Lord's mouth, and sorrowfully departed from Him, <span class="stiki" id="note184400"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21-22</a></span> this so many thousands of those men by whose hands Christ had been crucified, did on a sudden. In proportion as the wound was deeper in their own hearts, with the greater eagerness did they seek for a physician. Since therefore all these were from thence, the Psalm says of them, <q>For the Lord will not cast off His people.</q>...</p>

<p>6. What does the Psalm add? <q>In His hand are all the corners of the earth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse4">Psalm 94:4</a></span>: we recognise the corner stone: the corner stone is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. There cannot be a corner, unless it has united in itself two walls: they come from different sides to one corner, but they are not opposed to each other in the corner. The <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> comes from one side: the uncircumcision from the other; in Christ both peoples have met together: because He has become the stone, of which it is written, <q>The stone which the builders rejected, has become the head of the corner.</q>. ..</p>

<p>7. <q>For the sea is His and He made it</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse5">Psalm 94:5</a></span>. For the sea is this world, but God made also the sea: nor can the waves rage save only so far as to the shore, where He has marked their bounds. There is therefore no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, that has not received its measure....<q>And His hands prepared the dry land.</q> Be thou the dry land: thirst for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God: that as a sweet shower it may come upon you, may find in you fruit. He allows not the waves to cover what He has sown. <q>And His hands prepared the dry land.</q> Hence also therefore let us shout unto the Lord.</p>

<p>8. <q>O come, let us worship, and fall down to Him; and mourn before the Lord our Maker</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse6">Psalm 94:6</a></span>....Perhaps you are burning with the consciousness of a fault; blot out with tears the flame of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: mourn before the Lord: fearlessly mourn before the Lord, who made you; for He despises not the work of His own hands in you. Think not you can be restored by yourself. By yourself you may fall off, you can not restore yourself: He who made you restores you. <q>Let us mourn before the Lord our Maker:</q> weep before Him, confess unto Him, prevent His face in confession. For who are you who mournest before Him, and confessest unto Him, but one whom He created? The thing created has no slight confidence in Him who created it, and that in no indifferent fashion, but according to His own image and likeness.</p>

<p>9. <q>For He is the Lord our God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse7">Psalm 94:7</a></span>. But that we may without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> fall down and kneel before Him, what are we? <q>We are the people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hand.</q> See how elegantly he has transposed the order of the words, and as it were not given its own attribute to each word; that we may understand these very same to be the sheep, who are also the people. He said not, the sheep of His pasture, and the people of His hand; which might be thought more congruous, since the sheep belong to the pasture; but He said, <q>the people of His pasture.</q> The people are therefore sheep, since he says, <q>the people of His pasture:</q> the people themselves are sheep....He praises these sheep also in the Song of Solomon, speaking of some perfect ones as the teeth of His Spouse the Holy Church: <q>Your teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which come up from the washing; whereof every one bears twins, and there is none barren.</q>  What means, <q>Your teeth</q>? These by whom you speak, for the teeth of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are those through whom she speaks. Of what sort are your teeth? <q>Like a flock of sheep that are shorn.</q> Why, <q>that are shorn</q>? Because they have laid aside the burdens of the world. Were not those sheep, of which I was a little before speaking, shorn, whom the bidding of God had shorn, when He says, <q>Go and sell that you have, and give to the poor; and you shall find treasure in heaven: and come and follow Me</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note184403"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> They performed this bidding: shorn they came. And because those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, what is there said? <q>which come up from the washing;</q> that is, come up from the cleansing. <q>Whereof every one bears twins.</q> What twins? Those two commandments, wherefrom hang all the Law and the Prophets. <span class="stiki" id="note184404"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;22:40</a></span> </p>

<p>10. Therefore, <q>Today if you will hear His voice, harden not your hearts</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse8">Psalm 94:8</a></span>. O my people, the people of God! God addresses His people: not only the people of His which He shall not cast off, but also all His people. For He speaks in the corner stone <span class="stiki" id="note184405"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse20">Ephesians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> to each wall: that is, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> speaks in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, both to the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the people of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For some time ye heard His voice through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and hardened your hearts. He then, when you hardened your hearts, spoke through a herald; He now speaks by Himself, let your hearts soften. He who used to send heralds before Him, has now deigned to come Himself; He here speaks by His own mouth, He who used to speak by the mouths of the Prophets.</p>

<p>11. <q>As in the provocation, and in the day of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> in the wilderness, where your fathers <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse9">Psalm 94:9</a></span>. Let such be no more your fathers: imitate them not. They were your fathers, but if you do not imitate them, they shall not be your fathers: yet as you were born of them, they were your fathers. And if the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> who came from the ends of the earth, in the words of Jeremias, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> shall come unto You from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our forefathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184406"><a href="../bible/jer016.htm#verse19">Jeremiah&nbsp;16:19</a></span> if the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> forsook their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, to come to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; ought <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> whom their own God led from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note184407"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse21">Exodus&nbsp;14:21-22</a></span> wherein He overwhelmed their pursuing foes; whom He led out into the wilderness, fed with manna, <span class="stiki" id="note184408"><a href="../bible/exo016.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;16:13-35</a></span> never took His rod from correcting them, never deprived them of the blessings of His mercy; ought they to desert their own <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> have come unto Him? When your fathers tempted Me, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Me, and saw My works....</p>

<p>12. <q>Forty years long was I very near unto this generation, and said, It is a people that do always <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in their hearts; for they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> My ways</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse10">Psalm 94:10</a></span>. The forty years have the same meaning as the word <q>always.</q> For that number forty indicates the fullness of ages, as if the ages were perfected in this number. Hence our Lord fasted forty days, forty days He was tempted in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note184409"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;4:1-11</a></span> and forty days He was with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note184410"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;1:3</a></span> On the first forty days He showed us <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, on the latter forty days consolation: since beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> when we are tempted we are consoled. For His body, that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, must needs suffer <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> in this world: but that Comforter, who said, <q>Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184411"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;28:20</a></span> is not wanting. For this was I with them forty years, to show such a race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which always provokes Me, even unto the end of the world: because by those forty years He meant to signify the whole of this world's duration.</p>

<p>13. ...We began with exulting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: but this Psalm has ended with great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: <q>Unto whom I swore in My <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, that they should not enter into My rest</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa094.htm#verse11">Psalm 94:11</a></span>. It is a great thing for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to speak: how much greater for Him to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>? You should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> a man when he swears, lest he do somewhat on account of his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> against his will: how much more should you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when He swears, seeing He can <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> nought rashly? He chose the act of swearing for a confirmation. And by whom does God <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>? By Himself: for He has no greater by whom to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note184412"><a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse13">Hebrews&nbsp;6:13</a></span> By Himself He confirms His promises: by Himself He confirms His threats. Let no man say in his heart, His promise is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; His threat is false: as His promise is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, so is His threat sure.
