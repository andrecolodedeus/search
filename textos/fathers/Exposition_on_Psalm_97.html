<h1>Exposition on Psalm 97</h1>


<p>1. ...This Psalm is entitled, <q>A Psalm of David's, when his land was restored.</q> Let us refer the whole to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if we wish to keep the road of a right understanding: let us not depart from the corner stone, <span class="stiki" id="note184454"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse20">Ephesians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> lest our understanding suffer a fall: in Him let that become fixed, which wavered with unstable motion; let that rest upon Him, which before was waving to and fro in uncertainty. Whatever <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a man has in his mind when he hears the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let him not depart from Christ; when Christ has been revealed to him in the words, let him then be assured that he has understood; but before he arrives at the understanding of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, let him not presume that he has understood. <q>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184455"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> What does this mean, and how are these words understood in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>When his land was restored</q>?...</p>

<p>2. The earth restored is the resurrection of the flesh; for after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, all those things which are sung of in the Psalm were done. Let us then hear a Psalm full of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> on the restoration of the Earth. Let the Lord our God excite in us a hope and a pleasure worthy of so great a thing; may He rule our discourse, that it be fit for your hearts, that whatever <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> our heart does feel in such sights, He may bring on to our tongue, and thence conduct it into your ears, then to your heart, thence to your actions.</p>

<p>3. ...<q>The Lord is King, let the earth be glad: yea, let the multitude of the isles be joyous</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse1">Psalm 96:1</a></span>. It is so indeed, because the word of God has been preached not in the continent alone, but also in those isles which lie in mid sea: even these are full of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, full of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the sea does not retard Him who made it. Where ships can approach, cannot the words of God? The isles are filled. But figuratively the isles may be taken for all the Churches. Why isles? Because the waves of all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> roar around them. But as an isle may be beaten by the waves which on every side dash around it, yet cannot be broken, and rather itself does break the advancing waves, than by them is broken: so also the Churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, springing up throughout the world, have suffered the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of the ungodly, who roar around them on every side; and behold the isles stand fixed, and at last the sea is calmed.</p>

<p>4. <q>Clouds and darkness are round about Him: righteousness and judgment are the direction of His seat</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse2">Psalm 96:2</a></span>....The Lord Himself says: <q>For judgment I have come into this world; that they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184456"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;9:39</a></span> They who seem unto themselves to see, who think themselves wise, who think healing not needful for them, that they may be made blind, may not understand. And that <q>they which see not may see;</q> that they who confess their blindness may obtain to be enlightened. Let there be therefore <q>clouds and darkness round about Him,</q> for those who have not understood Him: for those who confess and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves, <q>righteousness and judgment are the direction of His seat.</q> He called those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him His seat: for from them has He made Himself a seat, since in them Wisdom sits; for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But we have heard from another passage of Scripture a strong confirmation of this interpretation. <q>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the righteous is the seat of Wisdom.</q>  Because then they who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him have been made righteous: justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they have become His own seat: He sits in them, judging from them, and guiding them....</p>

<p>5. <q>There shall go a fire before Him, and burn up His enemies on every side</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse3">Psalm 96:3</a></span>. We remember having read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, He shall say, <q>Depart into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184458"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> I do not think it is said of that fire. Why do I not? Because he speaks of some fire, which shall go before Him, before He comes to judgment. For it is said, that the fire goes before Him, and burns up His enemies on every side, that is, throughout the whole world. That fire will burn after His advent: this, on the contrary, will go before Him. What fire then is this?...Behold, we have understood the fire that goes before Him, that is to be understood of a kind of temporal punishment of the unbelieving and ungodly: let us understand the fire, if possible, of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the redeemed also; for thus we had proposed. The Lord Himself says: <q>I have come to send fire on the earth:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184459"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span> <q>fire</q> in the same way as a <q>sword;</q> as in another passage He says, that He was not come to send peace, but a sword, upon earth. <span class="stiki" id="note184460"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> The sword to divide, the fire to burn: but each salutary: for the sword of His own word has in salutary wise separated us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> habits. For He brought a sword, and separated every believer either from his father who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or from his mother in like manner unbelieving: or at least, if we were born of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, from his ancestors. For no man among us had not either a grandsire, or great grandsire, or some ancestry among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and in that unbelief which is accursed before God. We are separated from that which we were before; but the sword which separates, but slays not, has cut between us. In the same way the fire also: <q>I have come to send fire upon the earth.</q> Believers in Him were set on fire, they received the flame of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: and for this reason when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> itself had been sent to the Apostles, It thus appeared: <q>cloven tongues, like as of fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184461"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;2:3</a></span> Burning with this fire they set out on their march through the world, to burn and set on fire His enemies on every side. What enemies of His? They who forsaking the God who made them, adored the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> they had made....</p>

<p>6. <q>His lightnings gave shine unto the world</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse4">Psalm 96:4</a></span>. This is great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Do we not see? Is it not clear? His lightnings have shined unto the whole world: His enemies have been set on fire, and burnt. All that gainsaid has been burnt, and <q>His lightnings have given shine unto the world.</q> How have they shone? That the world might at length <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Whence were the lightnings? From the clouds. What are the clouds of God? The preachers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But you see a cloud, misty and dark in the sky, and it has I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what hidden within it. If there be lightning from the cloud, a brightness shines forth: from that which you despised, has burst forth that which you may dread. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> therefore sent His Apostles, as His preachers, like clouds: they were seen as men, and were despised; as clouds appear, and are despised, until what you wonder at gleams from them. For they were in the first place men encumbered with flesh, weak; then, men of low station, unlearned, ignoble: but there was within what could lighten forth; there was in them what could flash abroad. Peter a fisherman approached, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and the dead arose. <span class="stiki" id="note184462"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse40">Acts&nbsp;9:40</a></span> His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> form was a cloud, the splendour of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was the lightning. So in their words, so in their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, when they do things to be wondered at, and utter words to be wondered at, <q>His lightnings gave shine unto the world; the earth saw it, and was afraid.</q> Is it not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Does not the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world at length exclaim, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, afraid at the lightnings which burst forth from those clouds?</p>

<p>7. <q>The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse5">Psalm 96:5</a></span>. Who are the hills? The <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. Every high thing raising itself against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, trembled, yielded, and when I say, what has been already said, <q>melted,</q> a better word cannot be found. <q>The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord.</q> Where is the elevation of powers? Where the hardness of the unbelieving? The Lord was a fire unto them, they melted at His presence like wax; so long hard, until that fire was applied. Every height has been levelled; it dares not now <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Christ: and though the Pagan <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not in Him, he blasphemes Him not; though not as yet become a living stone, yet the hard hill has been subdued. <q>At the presence of the Lord of the whole earth:</q> not of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only, but of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also, as the Apostle says; for He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> alone, but of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also. <span class="stiki" id="note184463"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;3:29</a></span> He is therefore the Lord of the whole earth, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> born in Jud&aelig;a, but not born for Jud&aelig;a alone, because before He was born He created all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and He who created, also new created, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>8. <q>The heavens have declared His righteousness: and all the people have seen His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse6">Psalm 96:6</a></span>. What heavens have declared? <q>The heavens declare the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Who are the heavens? Those who have become His seat; for as God sits in the heavens, so does He sit in the Apostles, so does He sit in the preachers of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Even thou, if you will, shall be a heaven. Do you wish to be so? Purge from your heart the earth. If you have not earthly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and hast not in vain uttered the response, that you have <q>lifted up your heart,</q> you shall be a heaven.  <q>If you be risen with Christ,</q> says the Apostle to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, <q>set your affection on things above, not on things of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184466"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse1">Colossians&nbsp;3:1-2</a></span> You have begun to set your affection upon things above, not on things upon earth; have you not become a heaven? Thou carriest flesh, and in your heart you are already a heaven; for your conversation will be in heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note184467"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20</a></span> Being such, thou also declarest Christ; for who of the faithful declares not Christ?...Therefore the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> preaches Christ, and the heavens declare His righteousness; for all the faithful, whose care it is to gain unto God those who have not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and who do this from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, are heavens. From them God thunders forth the terror of His judgment; and he who was unbelieving trembles, and is alarmed, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>. He shows unto men what power Christ had throughout the world, by pleading with them, and leading them to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ. For how many this day have led their friends either to some pantomimist, or flute-player? Why, except from their liking him? And do ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ. For He who conquered the world has exhibited such spectacles, as that no man can say that he finds in them <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for blame. For each person's favourite in the theatre is often vanquished there. But no man is vanquished in Christ: there is no reason for shame. Seize, lead, draw, whom you may: be without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, you are leading unto Him, who displeases not those who see Him; and ask ye Him to enlighten them, that they may behold to good account.</p>

<p>9. <q>Confounded be all they that worship carved images</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse7">Psalm 96:7</a></span>. Hath not this come to pass? Have they not been confounded? Are they not daily confounded? For carved images are images wrought by the hand. Why are all who worship carved images confounded? Because all people have seen His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. All nations now confess the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Christ: let those who worship stones be ashamed. Because those stones were dead, we have found a living Stone; indeed those stones never lived, so that they cannot be called even dead; but our Stone is living, and has ever lived with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and though He died for us, He revived, and lives now, and death shall no more have dominion over Him. <span class="stiki" id="note184468"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;6:9</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His the nations have acknowledged; they leave the temples, they run to the Churches. Do they still seek to worship carved images? Have they not chosen to forsake their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>? They have been forsaken by their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. <q>Who <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</q> But there is a certain disputer who seems unto himself learned, and says, I do not worship that stone, nor that image which is without sense;...I worship not this image but I adore  what I see, and serve him whom I see not. Who is that? Some invisible deity, he replies, who presides over that image. By giving this account of their images, they seem to themselves able disputants, because they do not worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and yet do worship devils. <q>The things,</q> brethren, says the Apostle, <q>which the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> unto devils, and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that an idol is nothing: and that what the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to devils, and not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.</q>  Let them not therefore excuse themselves on this ground, that they are not devoted to insensate <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; they are rather devoted to devils, which is more dangerous. For if they were only worshipping <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, as they would not help them, so they would not hurt them; but if you worship and serve devils, they themselves will be your masters....</p>

<p>10. But observe <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, who are like the Angels. When you have found some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man who serves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you wish to worship him instead of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he forbids you: he will not arrogate to himself the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he will not be unto you as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but be with you under God. Thus did the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>. They preached the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Lycaonia. When they had performed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a> in Lycaonia, the people of that country brought victims, and wished to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to them, calling Barnabas Jupiter, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> Mercury: they were not pleased. Did they perchance refuse to be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to, because they abhorred to be compared to devils? No, but because they shuddered at divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> being paid to men. Their own words show this: it is no guess of ours; for the text of the book goes on to say how they were moved. <span class="stiki" id="note184471"><a href="../bible/act014.htm#verse14">Acts&nbsp;14:14-15</a></span> ...Just then, as good men forbade those who had wished to worship them as gods, and wish rather that God alone be worshipped, God alone be adored, to God alone <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> be offered, not to themselves; so also all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Angels seek His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> whom they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; endeavour to impel and to excite to the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of Him all whom they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: Him they declare to them, not themselves, since they are <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and because they are soldiers, they study only how to seek the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their Captain; but if they have sought their own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they are condemned as usurpers.  Such were the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; he claimed for himself divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and for all his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; he filled the Pagan temples, and persuaded them to offer images and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to himself. Was it not better to worship <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Angels than devils? They answer: we do not worship devils; we worship <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as you call them, the powers and the ministers of the great God. I wish ye would worship them: ye would easily learn from themselves not to worship them.  Hear an Angel teaching. He was teaching a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and showing him many wonders in the Revelation of John: and when some wonderful vision had been shown him, he trembled, and fell down at the Angel's feet; but that Angel, who sought not but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, said, <q>See thou do it not; for I am a fellow-servant of you, and of your brethren the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184474"><a href="../bible/rev019.htm#verse10">Revelation&nbsp;19:10</a></span> What then, my brethren? Let no man say, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the Angel may be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me, if I worship him not as my God. He is then <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with you, when you have chosen to worship him: for he is righteous, and loves God. As devils are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> if they are not worshipped, so are Angels <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> if they are worshipped instead of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But lest the weak and trembling heart perchance say unto itself: If then the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are incensed because they are not worshipped, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to offend them; what can even their chief the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> do unto you? If he had any power over us no one of us would remain. Are not daily so many things said against him by the mouth of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and yet the harvest of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> increases. When you are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the most depraved of your slaves, you give him the name, <q><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> Devil. Perhaps in this thou dost <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, since you say it to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and your immoderate <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> hurries you to revile the image of God: and yet you choose a term thou deeply hatest, to apply to him. If he could, would he not revenge himself? But it is not allowed: and he does so much only as is allowed him. For when he wished to tempt Job, he had to ask power to do so: <span class="stiki" id="note184475"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse11">Job&nbsp;1:11</a></span> and he could do nothing had he not received power. Why then do you not fearlessly worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without whose will no one hurts you, and by whose permission you are chastened, not overcome? For if it shall have pleased the Lord your God to permit some man to hurt you, or some spirit: He will chasten you, that you may cry unto Him:  <q>Confounded,</q> therefore, <q>be all they that delight in vain gods: worship Him, all you His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> Let Pagans learn to worship God: they wish to worship Angels: let them imitate Angels, and worship Him who is worshipped by Angels. <q>Worship Him, all you His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> Let that Angel worship who was sent to Cornelius (for worshipping Him he sent Cornelius to Peter), himself Peter's fellow-servant; let him worship Christ, Peter's Lord. <q>Worship Him, all you gods!</q></p>

<p>11. <q>Sion heard of it, and rejoiced</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse8">Psalm 96:8</a></span>. What did Sion hear? That all His Angels worship Him....For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was not as yet among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; in Jud&aelig;a the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had some of them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and the very <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> thought that they only belonged to Christ: the Apostles were sent to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, Cornelius was preached to; Cornelius <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and they who were with Cornelius were also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note184477"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse47">Acts&nbsp;10:47</a></span> But ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what happened, that they might be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: the reader indeed has not reached this point, but, nevertheless, some recollect; and let those who do not recollect, hear briefly from me. The Angel was sent to Cornelius: the Angel sent Cornelius to Peter; Peter came to Cornelius. And because Cornelius and his household were <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and uncircumcised: lest they might hesitate to give the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the uncircumcised: before Cornelius and his household were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came, and filled them, and they began to speak with tongues. Now the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had not fallen upon any one who had not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: but upon these It fell before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For Peter might hesitate whether he might <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the uncircumcised: the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came, they began to speak with tongues; the invisible gift was given, and took away all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the visible Sacrament; they were all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>....What did Sion hear, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at? That the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also had received the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. One wall had come, but the corner <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> not as yet. The name Sion is here peculiarly given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which was in Jud&aelig;a. <q>Sion heard of it, and rejoiced: and the daughters of Judah were glad.</q> Thus it is written, <q>The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and brethren that were in Jud&aelig;a heard.</q> See if the daughters of Jud&aelig;a rejoiced not. What did they hear? <q>That the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> had also received the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>...Therefore, <q>The daughters of Judah rejoiced because of Your judgments, O Lord.</q> What is, because of Your judgments? Because in any nation, and in any people, he that serves Him is accepted of Him:  for He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only, but also of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note184479"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;3:29</a></span> </p>

<p>12. See if this be not the reason for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the daughters of Judah. <q>For Thou, Lord, art most high over all the earth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse9">Psalm 96:9</a></span>. Not in Jud&aelig;a alone, but over Jerusalem; not over Sion only, but over all the earth. To this whole earth the judgments of God prevailed, so that it assembled its nations from every quarter: judgments with which they who have cut themselves off have no communion: they neither hear the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, nor see its completion; <q>For Thou, Lord, art most high over all the earth: You are exalted far above all gods.</q> What is <q>far</q>?  For it is said of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. What then means <q>far,</q> except that You may be acknowledged coequal with the Father? What means, <q>above all gods</q>? Who are they? Idols have not life, have not sense: devils have life and sense; but they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. What great thing is it that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is exalted above devils? He is exalted above devils: but neither is this very great; the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> gods indeed are devils,  but <q>He is far above all gods.</q> Even men are styled gods: <q>I have said, You are gods: and you are all the children of the Most Highest:</q> again it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stands in the congregation of princes: He is a Judge among gods.</q>  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord is exalted above all: not only above <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, not only above devils; but above all righteous men. Even this is not enough; above all Angels also: for whence otherwise is this, <q>Worship Him, all you gods</q>? <q>You are far exalted above all gods.</q></p>

<p>13. What then do we all, who have assembled before Him, before Him who is exalted far above all gods? He has given us a brief commandment, <q>O you that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord, see that you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the thing which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>!</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse10">Psalm 96:10</a></span>. Christ does not deserve that with Him you should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. You love Him: you should <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> what He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>. There is a man who is your enemy, he is what you are; you are the work of one Creator, with the same nature: and yet if your son were to speak unto your enemy, and come to his house, and constantly converse with him, you would be inclined to disinherit him; because he speaks with your enemy. And how so? Because you seem to say <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, You are my enemy's friend, and do you seek anything of my property? Attend then. You love Christ: <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> is Christ's foe; why speak with her? I say not, speak with her; why do you serve her? For Christ commands you to do many things, and thou dost them not; she commands you, and thou dost them. Christ commands you to clothe the poor man: and thou dost it not; <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> bids you defraud, and this thou dost in preference. If such be the case, if such you are, do not very confidently promise yourself Christ's heritage. But you say, I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ. Hence it appears that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if you shall be found to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>....</p>

<p>14. Because then he had said above, <q>see that you <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the thing which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> lest ye should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, lest he should kill you, he adds instantly, <q>The Lord preserves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of His servants.</q> Hear Him preserving the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of His servants, and saying, <q>Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184483"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;10:28</a></span> He who has most power against you, slays the body. What has he done unto you? What he also did to the Lord your God. Why do you love to have what Christ has, if you fear to suffer what Christ did? He came to bear your life, temporal, weak, subject unto death. Surely <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to die, if you can avoid dying. What you can not avoid through your nature, why do you not undergo by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Let the adversary who threatens take away from you that life, God gives you another life: for He gave you this life also, and without His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> even this shall not be taken from you; but if it be His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that it be taken from you, He has a life to give you in exchange; <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not to be <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> for His sake. Are you unwilling to put off a patched garment? He will give you a robe of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. What robe do you tell me of? <q>This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184484"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span> This very flesh of yours shall not perish. Your enemy can rage as far as to your death: he has not power beyond, either over your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or even over your flesh; for although he scatter your flesh about, he hinders not the resurrection. Men were fearful for their life: and what said the Lord unto them? <q>The very hairs of your head are all numbered.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184485"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;10:30</a></span> Do you, who losest not a single hair, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the loss of your life? All things are numbered with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He who created all things, will restore all things. They were not, and they were created: they were, and shall they not be restored?...<q>He shall deliver them from the hand of the ungodly.</q></p>

<p>15. But perhaps you will say, I lose this light. <q>There is sprung up a light for the righteous</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse11">Psalm 96:11</a></span>. What light do you fear you may lose? Do you fear you may be in darkness? Fear not you may lose light; nay, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest while you are guarding against the loss of this light, you may lose that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light. For we see to whom that light is given which you fear losing, and with whom it is shared. Do the righteous only see this sun, when He makes it rise over the just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, and rains upon the just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note184486"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> Wicked men, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, the unchaste, beasts, flies, worms, see that light together with you. What sort of light does He keep for the righteous, who gives this even to such as these? Deservedly the Martyrs beheld this light in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for they who despised this light of the sun, had some light in their eyes, which they longed for, who rejected this. Do you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they were really in misery, when they walked in chains? Spacious was the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to the faithful, light were the chains to the confessors. They who preached Christ amid their torments, had <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the iron-chair. What light has sprung up for the righteous? Not that which springs up for the unrighteous; not that which He causes to rise over the good and bad. There is a different light which springs up to the righteous; of which light, that never rose upon themselves, the unrighteous shall in the end say, <q>Therefore have we erred from the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the light of righteousness has not shined upon us, and the sun of righteousness rose not upon us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184487"><a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse6">Wisdom&nbsp;5:6</a></span> Behold, by loving this sun they have lain in the darkness of the heart. What did it profit them to have seen with their eyes this sun, and not in mind to have seen that light? Tobit was blind, but he used to teach his son the way of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that Tobit warned his son, and said to him, <q>Son, give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> of your substance; because that <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> suffer not to come into darkness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184488"><a href="../bible/tob004.htm#verse7">Tobit&nbsp;4:7,&nbsp;10</a></span> Even he who was in darkness spoke thus....Do you wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that light? Be true-hearted. What is, be true-hearted? Be not of a crooked heart before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, withstanding His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and wishing to bend Him unto you, and not to rule yourself to please Him; and you will feel the joyful <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> which all the true-hearted <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</p>

<p>16. <q>Be glad, you righteous</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa096.htm#verse12">Psalm 96:12</a></span>. Perhaps already the faithful hearing the word, <q>Be glad,</q> are thinking of banquets, preparing cups, waiting for the season of roses; because it is said, <q>Be glad, you righteous!</q> See what follows, <q>Be glad in the Lord.</q> You are waiting for the season of spring, that you may be glad: you have the Lord for joyful <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, the Lord is always with you, He has no special season; you have Him by night, you have Him by day. Be true-hearted; and you have ever <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> from Him. For that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is after the fashion of the world, is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Hear the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah: <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, says my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184489"><a href="../bible/isa057.htm#verse21">Isaiah&nbsp;57:21</a></span> What the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> call <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, such as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> who made no account of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>: let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him, brethren. He was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> both kinds of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. He certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the joys of the cup, for he was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the table, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the joys of marriage, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> those joys worldly and luxurious. He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them says with confidence, <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, says the Lord.</q> But it is not man who speaks, it is the Lord....But you say, I see not that light which Isaiah saw. Believe, and you shall see it. For perhaps you have not the eye to see it; for it is an eye by which that beauty is discerned. For as there is an eye of the flesh, by means of which this light is seen: so there is an eye of the heart, by which that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is perceived: perhaps that eye is wounded, dimmed, disturbed by passion, by <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, by indulgence, by senseless <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; your eye is disturbed: you can not see that light. Believe, before you see; you shall be healed, and shall see.</p>

<p>17. <q>And confess to the remembrance of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</q> Now made glad, now rejoicing in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, confess unto Him; for unless it were His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, you would not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in Him. For the Lord Himself says: <q>These things I have spoken to you: that in Me ye might have peace. But in the world you shall have tribulation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184490"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;16:33</a></span> If you are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, look for tribulations in this world; look not for more peaceful and better times. Brethren, you deceive yourselves; what the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> does not promise you, promise not to yourselves. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says; we are speaking to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; we ought not to disobey the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says this, that in the last times many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, many stumbling-blocks, many tribulations, much iniquity, shall abound; but he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. <span class="stiki" id="note184491"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;24:3-13</a></span> <q>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> it says, <q>of many shall wax cold.</q> Whosoever then has been steadfastly fervent in spirit, as the Apostle says, <q>fervent in spirit,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184492"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;12:11</a></span> his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> shall not wax cold: because <q>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184493"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Let no man therefore promise himself what the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> does not promise.
