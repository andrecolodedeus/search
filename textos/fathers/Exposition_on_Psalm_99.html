<h1>Exposition on Psalm 99</h1>


<p>1. Beloved brethren, it ought already to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you, as sons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and well instructed in the school of Christ through all the books of our ancient fathers, who wrote the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the great things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that their wish was to consult for our good, who were to live at this period, <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in Christ; who, at a seasonable time came unto us, the first time, in humility; at the second, destined to come in exaltation....For thus it is said in the Psalms: <q>Truth shall flourish out of the earth: and righteousness has looked down from heaven.</q>  Now, therefore, our whole design is, when we hear a Psalm, a Prophet, or the Law, all of which was written before <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh, to see Christ there, to understand Christ there. Attend therefore, beloved, to this Psalm, with me, and let us herein seek Christ; certainly He will appear to those who seek Him, who at first appeared to those who sought Him not; and He will not desert those who long for Him, who redeemed those who neglected Him. Behold, the Psalm begins concerning Him: of Him it is said:&mdash; </p>

<p>2. <q>The Lord is King, be the people <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse1">Psalm 98:1</a></span>. For <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> began to reign, began to be preached, after He arose from the dead and ascended into heaven, after He had filled His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with the confidence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, that they should not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death, which He had already killed in Himself. Our Lord Christ began then to be preached, that they who wished for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him; and the peoples who worshipped <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. They who worshipped what they had made were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, because He by whom they were made was declared. He announced, in fact, through His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Himself, who wished them to be converted unto Him by whom they were made, and to be turned away from those things which they had made themselves. They were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with their Lord in behalf of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, they who even if they were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with their slave on their idol's account, were to be condemned. For their slave was better than their idol: for God made their slave, the carpenter made their idol. They were so <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> in their idol's behalf, that they feared not to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with their Lord. But the words, <q>be they <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>,</q> are a prediction, not a command; for in a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> it is that this is said, <q>The Lord is King, be the people <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</q> Some good results even from the enraged people: let them be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and in their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> let the Martyrs be crowned....You heard when Jeremiah was being read before the reading of the Apostle,  if you listened; ye saw therein the times in which we now live. He said, <q>The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, let them perish from the earth, and from under the heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184510"><a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;10:11</a></span> He said not, The gods that have not made the heavens and earth, let them perish from the heaven and from the earth; because they never were in heaven: but what did he say? <q>Let them perish from the earth, and from under the heaven.</q> As if, while the word earth was repeated, the repetition of the word heaven were wanting (because they never were in heaven): he repeats the earth twice, since it is under heaven. <q>Let them perish from the earth, and from under the heaven,</q> from their temples. Consider if this be not now taking place; if in a great measure it has not already happened: for what, or how much, has remained? The <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> remained rather in the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, than in the niches of the temples.</p>

<p>3. <q>He who sits between the cherubims:</q> thou dost understand, <q>He is King: let the earth be stirred up.</q>...The Cherubim is the seat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> shows us, a certain exalted heavenly throne, which we see not; but the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it as His own seat: and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> has Itself revealed to the servants of God where God sits. Not that God does sit, as does man; but thou, if you dost wish that God sit in you, if you will be good, shall be the seat of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for thus is it written, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the righteous is the seat of wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184511"><a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse23">Proverbs&nbsp;12:23</a></span> For a throne is in our language called a seat. For some, conversant with the Hebrew tongue, have interpreted <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> in the Latin language (for it is a Hebrew term) by the words, fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore, because God surpasses all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, He is said to sit above the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Let there be therefore in you fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and even you shall be the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>....He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things: for our hairs are numbered before God. <span class="stiki" id="note184512"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;10:30</a></span> But the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which He willed man to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is different from this; the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which He willed you to have, pertains to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And who can, you may perhaps say unto me, perfectly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Law, so that he may have within himself the fullness  of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Law, and be able to be the seat of God? Be not disturbed; it is briefly told you what you have, if you dost wish to have the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and to become the throne of God: for the Apostle says, <q>Love is the fulfilling of the Law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184513"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> What follows then? You have lost the whole of your excuse. Ask your heart; see whether it has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. If there be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> there, there is the fulfilment of the Law there also; already God dwells in you, you have become the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Be the people <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>;</q> what can the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> people do against him who has become the throne of God? You give heed unto them who rage against you: Who is it that sits within you, you give not heed. You have become a heaven, and do you fear the earth? For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says in another passage, that the Lord our God does declare, <q>The heaven is My throne.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184514"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;66:1</a></span> If therefore even thou by having the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and by having <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, hast been made the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have become a heaven. For this heaven which we look up to with these eyes of ours, is not very precious before God. Holy <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are the heaven of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the minds of the Angels, and all the minds of His servants, are the heaven of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>4. <q>The Lord is great in Sion, and high above all people</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse2">Psalm 98:2</a></span>....He whom I spoke to you of as above the Cherubims, is great in Sion. Ask thou now, what is Sion? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Sion to be the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The city of Jerusalem is called Sion; and is so called according to a certain interpretation, for that Sion signifies watching, that is, sight and <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>; for to watch is to look forward to, or gaze upon, or strain the eyes to see. Now every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a Sion, if it tries to see that light which is to be seen. For if it shall have gazed upon a light of its own, it is darkened; if upon His, it is enlightened. But, now that it is clear that Sion is the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; what is the city of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the Holy Church? For men who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, and who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their God who dwells in them, constitute a city unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because a city is held together by some law; their very law is Love; and that very Love is God: for openly it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is Love.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184515"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:8</a></span> He therefore who is full of Love, is full of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and many, full of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, constitute a city full of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That city of God is called Sion; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> therefore is Sion. In it God is great....</p>

<p>5. Do ye <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, brethren, that they whose instruments re-echoed yesterday, are not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with our <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>? But let us not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them, but let us fast for them. For the Lord our God who sits in us has said, He has Himself commanded us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our enemies, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> us: <span class="stiki" id="note184516"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> and as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does this, the persecutors are almost extinct....The drunken man does not offend himself, but he offends the sober man. Show me a man who is at last <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lives gravely, sighs for that everlasting peace which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has promised him; and see that when he has seen a man dancing to an instrument, he is more grieved for his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, than for a man who is in a frenzy from a fever. If then we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, considering that we also have been freed from those very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, let us grieve for them; and if we grieve for them, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them; and that we may be heard, let us fast for them. For we do not keep our own <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> in their holidays. Different are the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> which we celebrate through the days of the approaching <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, through different seasons which are fixed for us in Christ: but through their holidays we fast for this reason, that when they are rejoicing, we may groan for them. For by their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> they excite our grief, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us to remember how wretched they are as yet. But since we see many freed thence, where we also have been, we ought not to despair even of them. And if they are still enraged, let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; and if still a particle of earth that has remained behind be stirred up against us, let us continue in lamentation for them, that to them also God may grant understanding, and that with us they may hear those words, in which we are at this moment rejoicing.</p>

<p>6. All these very people, over whom You are great in Sion, <q>Let them confess unto Your Name, which is great</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse3">Psalm 98:3</a></span>. Your Name was little when they were enraged: it has become great; let them now confess. In what sense do we say, that the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was little, before it was spread abroad to so great an extent? Because His report is meant by His Name. His Name was small; already it has become great. What nation is there that has not heard of the Name of Christ? Therefore let now the people confess unto Your Name, which is great, who before were enraged with Your little Name. Wherefore shall they confess? Because it is <q>wonderful and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q> Your very Name is wonderful and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. He is so preached as crucified, so preached as humbled, so preached as judged, that He may come exalted, that He may come living, that He may come to judge in power. He spares at present the people who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him, because <q>the long-suffering of God leads to repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184517"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;2:4</a></span> For He who now spares, will not always spare: nor will He, who is now being preached that He may be feared, fail to come to judge. He will come, my brethren, He will come: let us <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, and let us live so that we may be found on His right hand. For He will come, and will judge, so as to place some on the left hand, some on the right. <span class="stiki" id="note184518"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;25:31-33</a></span> And He does not act in an uncertain manner, so as to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> perchance between men, so that he who should be set on the right hand, be set on the left; or that he who ought to stand on the left, by a mistake of God should stand on the right: He cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, so as to place the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> where He ought to set the good; nor to place the good, where He should have set the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. If He cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, we <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, if we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not; but if we have feared in this life, we shall not then have what to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for. <q>For the King's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> loves judgment.</q>...</p>

<p>7. <q>You have prepared equity; You have wrought judgment and righteousness in Jacob.</q> For we too ought to have judgment, we ought to have righteousness; but He works in us judgment and righteousness, who created us in whom He might work them. How ought we too to have judgment and righteousness? You have judgment, when thou dost distinguish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from good: and righteousness when you follow the good, and turnest aside from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. By distinguishing them, you have judgment; by doing, you have righteousness. <q>Eschew <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> he says, <q>and do good; seek peace, and ensue it.</q>  You should first have judgment, then righteousness. What judgment? That you may first judge what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And what righteousness? That you may shun <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and do good. But this you will not gain from yourself; see what he has said, <q>You have wrought judgment and righteousness in Jacob.</q></p>

<p>8. <q>O magnify the Lord our God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse5">Psalm 98:5</a></span>. Magnify Him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, magnify Him well. Let us praise Him, let us magnify Him who has wrought the very righteousness which we have; who wrought it in us, Himself. For who but He who justified us, wrought righteousness in us? For of Christ it is said, <q>who justifies the ungodly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184520"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> ...<q>And fall down before  His footstool: for He is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q> What are we to fall down before? His footstool. What is under the feet is called a footstool, in Greek <span class="greek">&#x1F51;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, in Latin <em>Scabellum</em> or <em>Suppedaneum.</em> But consider, brethren, what he commands us to fall down before. In another passage of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> it is said, <q>The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184522"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;66:1</a></span> Does he then bid us worship the earth, since in another passage it is said, that it is God's footstool? How then shall we worship the earth, when the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says openly, <q>You shall worship the Lord your God</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note184523"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse13">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:13</a></span> Yet here it says, <q>fall down before His footstool:</q> and, explaining to us what His footstool is, it says, <q>The earth is My footstool.</q> I am in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to worship the earth, lest He who made the heaven and the earth condemn me; again, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not to worship the footstool of my Lord, because the Psalm bids me, <q>fall down before His footstool.</q> I ask, what is His footstool? And the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> tells me, <q>the earth is My footstool.</q> In hesitation I turn unto Christ, since I am herein seeking Himself: and I discover how the earth may be worshipped without impiety,  how His footstool may be worshipped without impiety. For He took upon Him earth from earth; because flesh is from earth, and He received flesh from the flesh of Mary. And because He walked here in very flesh, and gave that very flesh to us to eat for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and no one eats that flesh, unless he has first worshipped: we have found out in what sense such a footstool of our Lord's may be worshipped, and not only that we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not in worshipping it, but that we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in not worshipping. But does the flesh give life? Our Lord Himself, when He was speaking in praise of this same earth, said, <q>It is the Spirit that quickens, the flesh profits nothing.</q>...But when our Lord praised it, He was speaking of His own flesh, and He had said, <q>Except a man eat My flesh, he shall have no life in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184525"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse54">John&nbsp;6:54</a></span> Some <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of His, about seventy,  were offended, and said, <q>This is an hard saying, who can hear it?</q> And they went back, and walked no more with Him. It seemed unto them hard that He said, <q>Except you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, you have no life in you:</q> they received it foolishly, they thought of it carnally, and imagined that the Lord would cut off parts from His body, and give unto them; and they said, <q>This is a hard saying.</q> It was they who were hard, not the saying; for unless they had been hard, and not meek, they would have said unto themselves, He says not this without reason, but there must be some latent <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> herein. They would have remained with Him, softened, not hard: and would have learned that from Him which they who remained, when the others departed, learned. For when twelve <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had remained with Him, on their departure, these remaining followers suggested to Him, as if in grief for the death of the former, that they were offended by His words, and turned back. But He instructed them, and says unto them, <q>It is the Spirit that quickens, but the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184527"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse63">John&nbsp;6:63</a></span> Understand spiritually  what I have said; you are not to eat this body which you see; nor to drink that blood which they who will crucify Me shall pour forth. I have commended unto you a certain <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>; spiritually understood, it will quicken. Although it is needful that this be visibly celebrated, yet it must be spiritually understood. </p>

<p>9. <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> among His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and Samuel among such as call upon His Name: these called upon the Lord, and He heard them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse6">Psalm 98:6</a></span>. <q>He spoke unto them out of the cloudy pillar</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse7">Psalm 98:7</a></span>....Of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> it is not there stated that he was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. But if he was not this, what was he? Could he be anything greater than a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>? This Psalm declares that he also was himself a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> among His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</q> They therefore were the Lord's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Samuel is read of later in the Book of Kings: this Samuel is in David's times; for he anointed the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David. Samuel from his infancy grew up in the temple....He mentions these: and by these desires us to understand all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Yet why has he here named those? Because we said that we ought here to understand Christ. Attend, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren. He said above, <q>O magnify the Lord our God: and fall down before His footstool, for He is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>:</q> praising some one, that is, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; whose footstool is to be worshipped, because He assumed flesh, in which He was to appear before the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; and wishing to show unto us that the ancient fathers also had preached of Him, because <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is Himself the True Priest, he mentioned these, because God spoke unto them out of the cloudy pillar. What means, <q>out of the cloudy pillar</q>? He was speaking figuratively. For if He spoke in some cloud, those obscure words predicted some one unknown, yet to be manifest. This unknown one is no longer unknown; for He is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by us, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>....He who first spoke out of the cloudy pillar, has in Person spoken unto us in His footstool; that is, on earth, when He had assumed the flesh, for which reason we worship His footstool, for He is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. He Himself used to speak out of the cloud, which was not then understood: He has spoken in His own footstool, and the words of His cloud have been understood. <q>They kept His testimonies, and the law that He gave them.</q>...<q>You heard them,</q> he says, <q>O Lord our God: You were forgiving to them, O God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse8">Psalm 98:8</a></span>. God is not said to be forgiving toward anything but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: when He pardons <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, then He forgives. And what had He in them to punish, so that He was forgiving in pardoning them? He was forgiving in pardoning their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He was also forgiving in punishing them. For what follows? <q>And punished all their own affections.</q> Even in punishing them You were forgiving toward them: for not in remitting, but also in punishing their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, have You been forgiving. Consider, my brethren, what he has taught us here: attend. God is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with him whom, when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He scourges not: for unto him to whom He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> forgiving, He not only remits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that they may not injure him in a future life; but also chastens him, that he delight not in continual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>10. Come, my brethren; if we ask how these were punished, the Lord will aid me to tell you. Let us consider these three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, and Samuel: and how they were punished, since he said, <q>You have punished all their own affections:</q> meaning those affections of theirs, which the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in their hearts, which men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not. For they were living in the midst of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, without complaint from man. But what do we say? That perhaps the early life of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was sinful; for he fled from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, after slaying a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note184529"><a href="../bible/exo002.htm#verse12">Exodus&nbsp;2:12-15</a></span> The early life of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> also was such as would displease <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for he allowed a maddened and infatuated people to make an idol to worship; <span class="stiki" id="note184530"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;32:1-4</a></span> and an idol was made for God's people to worship. What <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> did Samuel, who was given up when an infant to the temple? He passed all his life amid the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of God: from childhood the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Nothing was ever said of Samuel, nothing by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Perhaps God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of somewhat there to chasten; since even what seems perfect unto men, unto that Perfection is still imperfect. Artists show many of their works to the unskilful; and when the unskilful have pronounced them perfect, the artists polish them still further, as they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is still wanting to them, so that men wonder at things they had imagined already perfect having received so much additional polish. This happens in buildings, and in paintings, and in embroidery, and almost in every species of art. At first they judge it to be already in a manner perfect, so that their eyes desire nothing further: but the judgment of the inexperienced eye is one, and that of the rule of art another. Thus also these Saints were living before the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if faultless, as if perfect, as if Angels: but He who punished all their own affections, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was wanting in them. But He punished them not in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but in mercy: He punished them that He might perfect what He had begun, not to condemn what He had cast away. God therefore punished all their affections. How did He punish Samuel? where is this punishment?...What was said unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was a type, not a punishment. What punishment is death to an old man? What punishment was it, not to enter into that land, into which unworthy men entered? But what is said of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>? He also died an old man: his sons succeeded him in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>: his son afterwards ruled in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>: how did He punish <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> also?  Samuel also died a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> old man, leaving his sons as his successors.  I seek for the punishment inflicted upon them, and according to men I find it not: but according to what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the servants of God suffer every day, they were day by day punished. Read ye, and see the punishments, and you also who are advanced bear the punishments. Every day they suffered from the obstinate people, every day they suffered from the ungodly livers; and were compelled to live among those whose lives they daily censured. This was their punishment. He unto whom it is small has not advanced far; for the ungodliness of others torments you in proportion as you have departed far from your own....</p>

<p>11. <q>O magnify the Lord our God!</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa098.htm#verse9">Psalm 98:9</a></span>. Again we magnify Him. He who is merciful even when He strikes, how is He to be praised, how is He to be magnified? Can you show this unto your son, and cannot God? For you are not good when thou dost caress your son, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> when you strike him. Both when thou dost caress him you are a father, and when you strike him, you are his father: thou dost caress him, that he may not faint; you strike him, that he may not perish. <q>O magnify the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and worship Him upon His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill: for the Lord our God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q> As he said above, <q>O magnify the Lord our God and fall down before His footstool:</q>  now we have understood what it is to worship His footstool: thus also but now after he had magnified the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that no man might magnify Him apart from His hill, he has also praised His hill. What is His hill? We read elsewhere concerning this hill, that a stone was cut from the hill without hands, and shattered all the kingdoms of the earth, and the stone itself increased. This is the vision of Daniel which I am relating. This stone which was cut from the hill without hands increased, and <q>became,</q> he says, <q>a great mountain, and filled the whole face of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note184534"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse34">Daniel&nbsp;2:34-35</a></span> Let us worship on that great mountain, if we desire to be heard. Heretics  do not worship on that mountain, because it has filled the whole earth; they have stuck fast on part of it, and have lost the whole. If they acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they will worship on this hill with us. For we already see how that stone that was cut from the mountain without hands has increased, and how great tracts of earth it has prevailed over, and unto what nations it has extended. What is the mountain whence the stone was hewn without hands? The Jewish kingdom, in the first place; since they worshipped one God. Thence was hewn the stone, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>....That stone then was born of the mountain without hands: it increased, and by its increase broke all the kingdoms of the earth. It has become a great mountain, and has filled the whole face of the earth. This is the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in whose communion <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that you are. But they who are not in her communion, since they worship and praise God apart from this same mountain, are not heard unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; although they may be heard unto certain temporal things. Let them not flatter themselves, because God hears them in some things: for He hears Pagans also in some things. Do not the Pagans cry unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it rains? Wherefore? Because He makes His sun to rise over the good and the bad, and sends rain upon the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note184536"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> Boast not therefore, Pagan, that when you cry unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God sends rain, for He sends rain upon the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. He has heard you in temporal things: He hears you not in things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, unless you have worshipped in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill. <q>Worship Him upon His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hill: for the Lord our God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q>...</p>
