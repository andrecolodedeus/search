<h1>Extracts from Various Books Concerning Abgar the King and Add&aelig;us the Apostle</h1>

<h2>1</h2>

<p> <em>Of the blessed Add&aelig;us the apostle. From his teaching which he gave in <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> before <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the King</a> and the assembly of the city.</em> </p>

<p>And, when he had entered the sepulchre, he was raised to life again, and came forth from the sepulchre with many. And those who were guarding the sepulchre saw not how He came forth from the sepulchre; but the watchers from on high&mdash; they were the proclaimers and announcers of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. For, had He not willed, He had not died, because He is Lord of death, the exit from <em>this life</em>; nor, had it not pleased Him, would He have put on a body, inasmuch as He is Himself the framer of the body. For that will which led Him to stoop to be born of the Virgin, likewise caused Him further to descend to the suffering of death.&mdash; <em>And a little after</em> (<em>we read</em>): For, although His appearance was that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, yet His power, and His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and his authority, were those of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>2</h2>

<p> <em>From the teaching of Add&aelig;us the apostle, which was spoken in the city of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>.</em> </p>

<p>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I said unto you, that none of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which go forth out of the bodies of men are under <em>the power of</em> death, but that they all live and continue to exist, and that there are for them mansions and an abode of rest. For the reasoning <em>power</em> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> does not cease, nor the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because it is the image of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> God. For it is not without perceptions, after the manner of the bodily frame, which has no perception of that corruption which has acquired dominion over it. Recompense, however, and reward it will not receive apart from its bodily form, because what it experiences belongs not to itself alone, but to the bodily form also in which it dwelt for a time. But the disobedient, who have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will then repent without avail.</p>

<p> <em>From the epistle of Add&aelig;us the apostle, which he spoke in the city of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>.</em> </p>

<p>Give heed to this ministry which you hold, and with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling continue ye in it, and minister every day. Minister ye not in it with neglectful habits, but with the discreetness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And let not the praises of Christ cease out of your mouth, and let not any sense of weariness come over you at the season of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Give heed to the verity which you hold, and to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which you have received, and to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which I commit to you. Because before the tribunal of Christ will it be required of you, when He makes reckoning with the pastors and overseers, and when He shall take His money from the traders with the <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> of what they have taught.  For He is the Son of a King, and goes to receive a kingdom, and He will return and come and make a resuscitation to life of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>Add&aelig;us  preached at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> and in Mesopotamia (he was from Paneus ) in the days of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a>. And, when he was among the Zophenians, Severus the son of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> sent and slew him at Agel Hasna, as also a young man his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</p>

<p>71. and Narcissus.  For they did not suffer that selection of the Seventy-two to be wanting, as likewise neither that of the Twelve. This <em>man</em> was of the Seventy-two: perhaps he was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of Add&aelig;us the apostle.</p>

<h2>6</h2>

<p> <em>From the departure</em>  <em>of Marath</em>  <em>Mary from the world, and the birth and childhood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Book the Second.</em></p>

<p>In the year three hundred and forty-five, in the month of the latter Tishrin,  Marath Mary went out from her house, and went to the sepulchre of Christ: because every day she used to go and weep there. But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> immediately after the death of Christ seized the sepulchre, and heaped great stones at the door of it. And over the sepulchre and Golgotha they set guards, and commanded them that, if any one should go and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at the sepulchre or at Golgotha, he should immediately be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> took away the cross of our Lord, and those two other crosses, and that spear with which our Saviour was struck, and those nails which they drove into His hands and into His feet, and those robes of mockery in which He had been clad; and they hid them: lest, as they said, any one of the kings or of the chief <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should come and inquire concerning the putting to death of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And the guards went in and said to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: Mary comes in the evening and in the morning, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> there. And there was a commotion in Jerusalem on account of Marath Mary. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> went to the judge, and said to him: My lord, send and command Mary that she go not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at the sepulchre and at Golgotha. And while they were deliberating, lo! letters came from <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a>, the king of the city of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, to Sabina the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>  who had been appointed by <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius the emperor</a>, and as far as the river Euphrates the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> Sabina had authority. And, because Add&aelig;us the apostle, one of the seventy-two <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, had gone down and built a church at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, and had cured the disease with which <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a> was afflicted&mdash; for <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a> loved <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and was constantly inquiring about Him; and, when Christ was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> and <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a> heard that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had slain Him on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, he was much displeased; and <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> arose and rode and came as far as the river Euphrates, because he wished to go up against Jerusalem and lay it waste; and, when <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> came and was arrived at the river Euphrates, he deliberated in his mind: If I pass over, there will be enmity between me and <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius the emperor</a>. And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> wrote letters and sent them to Sabina the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, and Sabina sent them to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius the emperor</a>. In this manner did <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> write to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius the emperor</a>:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>From <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a>, the king of the city of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>. Much peace to your Majesty, our lord <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a>! In order that your Majesty may not be offended with me, I have not passed over the river Euphrates: for I have been wishing to go up against Jerusalem and lay her waste, forasmuch as she has slain Christ, a skilful healer. But, as a great sovereign who has authority over all the earth and over us, send and do me judgment on the people of Jerusalem. For be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your Majesty that I desire that you will do me judgment on the crucifiers.</q></p>

<p>And Sabina received the letters, and sent them to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius the emperor</a>. And, when he had read them, <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius the emperor</a> was greatly incensed, and he desired to destroy and slay all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And the people of Jerusalem heard it and were alarmed. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> went to the governor, and said to him: My lord, send and command Mary that she go not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at the sepulchre and Golgotha. The judge said to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: Go ye yourselves, and give her what command and what caution ye please.</p>

<h2>7</h2>

<p> <em>From the homily composed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mar Jacob, the teacher, on the fall of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</em> </p>

<p>To <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> he made his journey, and found in it a great work:</p>

<p>For the king was become a labourer for the church, and was building it.</p>

<p>The apostle Add&aelig;us stood in it like a builder,</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">King Abgar</a> laid aside his diadem and built with him.</p>

<p>When apostle and king concurred the one with the other,</p>

<p>What idol must not fall before them?</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> fled to the land of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</p>

<p>And the tale of the crucifixion had got before him to the country of the Chaldeans.</p>

<p>He said, when they were making sport of the signs of the Zodiac, that he was nothing.</p>

<h2>8</h2>

<p> <em>From the homily about the town of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</em> </p>

<p>To Simon was allotted Rome,  and to John Ephesus; to Thomas India, and to Add&aelig;us the country of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>.  And, when they were sent each one of them to the district which had been allotted to him, they devoted themselves  to bring the <em>several</em> countries to discipleship.</p>
