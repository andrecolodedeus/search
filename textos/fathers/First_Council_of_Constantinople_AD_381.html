<h1>First Council of Constantinople (A.D. 381)</h1>

<h2>Creed</h2> 

<p>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth and of all things visible and invisible. And in one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, begotten of his Father before all worlds, Light of Light, very God of very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, begotten not made, being of one substance with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by whom all things were made. Who for us men and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> came down from heaven and was incarnate by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>. He suffered and was buried, and the third day he rose again according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and ascended into heaven, and sits at the Right Hand of the Father. And he shall come again with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to judge both the quick and the dead. Whose kingdom shall have no end. (<em>I</em>)</p>

<p>And [we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>] in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, the Lord and Giver-of-Life, who proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, who with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> together is worshipped and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, who spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And [we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>] in one, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, (<em>II</em>) <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and Apostolic Church. We acknowledge one Baptism for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, [and] we look for the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>Letter of the Same Holy Synod to the Most Pious Emperor Theodosius the Great, to Which are Appended the Canons Enacted by Them</h2>

<p>To the most religious <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>, the Holy Synod of Bishops assembled in Constantinople out of different Provinces.</p>

<p>We begin our letter to your Piety with thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has established the empire of your Piety for the common peace of the Churches and for the support of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith. And, after rendering due thanks unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in duty bound we lay before your Piety the things which have been done in the Holy Synod. When, then, we had assembled in Constantinople, according to the letter of your Piety, we first of all renewed our unity of heart each with the other, and then we pronounced some concise definitions, ratifying the Faith of the Nicene Fathers, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> which have sprung up, contrary thereto. Besides these things, we also framed certain Canons for the better ordering of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, all which we have subjoined to this our letter. Wherefore we beseech your Piety that the decree of the Synod may be ratified, to the end that, as you have honoured the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by your letter of citation, so you should set your seal to the conclusion of what has been decreed. May the Lord establish your empire in peace and righteousness, and prolong it from generation to generation; and may he add unto your earthly power the fruition of the heavenly kingdom also. May God by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C7;&#x03B1;&#x1FD6;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD; &#x1F01;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>) of the Saints,  show favour to the world, that you may be strong and eminent in all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things as an Emperor most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Canons of the One Hundred and Fifty Fathers who assembled at Constantinople during the Consulate of those Illustrious Men, Flavius Eucherius and Flavius Evagrius on the VII of the Ides of July.</h2> 

<p>The Bishops out of different provinces assembled by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Constantinople, on the summons of the most religious <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>, have decreed as follows:</p>

<h3>Canon 1</h3>

<p>The Faith of the Three Hundred and Eighteen Fathers assembled at Nice in Bithynia shall not be set aside, but shall remain firm. And every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> shall be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>, particularly that of the Eunomians or [<em>Anom&aelig;ans, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> or</em>] Eudoxians, and that of the Semi-<a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> or <a href="../cathen/12174a.htm">Pneumatomachi</a>, and that of the Sabellians, and that of the Marcellians, and that of the <a href="../cathen/12043a.htm">Photinians</a>, and that of the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 2</h3>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are not to go beyond their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> to churches lying outside of their bounds, nor bring confusion on the churches; but let the Bishop of Alexandria, according to the canons, alone administer the affairs of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the East manage the East alone, the privileges of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, which are mentioned in the canons of Nice, being preserved; and let the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Asian Diocese administer the Asian affairs only; and the Pontic <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only Pontic matters; and the Thracian <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> only Thracian affairs. And let not <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> go beyond their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> for ordination or any other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> ministrations, unless they be invited. And the aforesaid canon concerning <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> being observed, it is evident that the synod of every province will administer the affairs of that particular province as was decreed at Nice. But the Churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations must be governed according to the custom which has prevailed from the times of the Fathers.</p>

<h3>Canon 3</h3>

<p>Concerning Maximus the Cynic and the disorder which has happened in Constantinople on his account, it is decreed that Maximus never was and is not now a Bishop; that those who have been ordained by him are in no order whatever of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; since all which has been done concerning him or by him, is declared to be invalid.</p>

<h3>Canon 4</h3>

<p>(Probably adopted at a Council held in Constantinople the next year, 382. <em>Vide</em>. Introduction on the number of the Canons.)</p>

<p>In regard to the tome of the Western [Bishops], we receive those in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> also who confess the unity of the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<h3>Canon 5</h3>

<p>Those who from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> turn to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and to the portion of those who are being saved, we receive according to the following method and custom: <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and Macedonians, and Sabbatians, and Novatians, who call themselves Cathari or Aristori, and Quarto-decimans or Tetradites, and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a>, we receive, upon their giving a written renunciation [of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>] and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which is not in accordance with the Holy, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and Apostolic <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. Thereupon, they are first sealed or anointed with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> oil upon the forehead, eyes, nostrils, mouth, and ears; and when we seal them, we say, <q>The Seal of the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> But Eunomians, who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with only one immersion, and <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a>, who are here called Phrygians, and Sabellians, who teach the identity of Father and Son, and do sundry other mischievous things, and [the partisans of] all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>&mdash; for there are many such here, particularly among those who come from the country of the Galatians:&mdash; all these, when they desire to turn to <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, we receive as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. On the first day we make them <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; on the second, <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>; on the third, we <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a> them by breathing thrice in their face and ears; and thus we instruct them and oblige them to spend some time in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and then we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them.</p>
