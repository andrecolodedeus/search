<h1>Fragments</h1>

<h2>1. Letter to the Church at Alexandria</h2> 

<p>Peter, to the brethren beloved and established in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, peace in the Lord. Since I have found out that Meletius acts in no way for the common good&mdash;for neither is he contented with the letter of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>&mdash;but, invading my parish,  has assumed so much to himself as to endeavour to separate from my authority the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>,  and those who had been entrusted with visiting the needy;  and, giving <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his desire for pre-eminence, has ordained in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> several unto himself; now, take heed to this, and hold no communion with him, until I meet him in company with some wise and discreet men, and see what the designs are which he has thought upon. Farewell.</p>

<h2>2. On the Godhead</h2> 

<p>Since certainly <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062288"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;1:17</a></span> whence also by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we are saved, according to that word of the apostle, <q>and that not of yourselves, nor of works, Jest any man should boast; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note062289"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;2:8-9</a></span> by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q>  and <q>was found in fashion as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062291"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> But yet He was not left without His divinity. For neither <q>though He was rich did He become poor</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062292"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 8:9</a></span> that He might absolutely be separated from His power and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but that He might Himself endure death for us sinners, the just for the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, that He might bring us to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>being <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in the flesh, but quickened by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; </q>and afterwards other things. Whence the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> also asserts the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when he says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us; </q>then indeed, from the time when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had saluted the virgin, saying, <q>Hail, you that are highly favoured, the Lord is with you.</q> Now when Gabriel said, <q>The Lord is with you,</q> he meant <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is with you. For he shows that He was conceived in the womb, and was to become flesh; as it is written, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you; therefore also that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which shall be born of you shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note062293"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke 1:35</a></span> and afterwards other things. Now <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, in the absence of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who easily effects everything, was made flesh in the womb of the virgin, not requiring the operation of the presence of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. For more efficacious than a man was the power of God overshadowing the virgin, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also who came upon her.</p>

<h2>3. On the Advent of Our Saviour</h2> 

<p>And He said unto Judas, <q>Do you betray the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>? </q> <span class="stiki" id="note062295"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse48">Luke 22:48</a></span> These things and the like, and all the signs which He showed, and His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, prove that He is God made man. Both things therefore are demonstrated, that He was God by nature, and that He was man by nature.</p>

<h2>4. On the Sojourning of Christ with Us</h2> 

<p>Both therefore is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, that he was God by nature, and was made man by nature.</p>

<h2>5.&mdash; That Up to the Time of the Destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews Rightly Appointed the Fourteenth Day of the First Lunar Month</h2>

<h3>1</h3> 

<p>1. Since the mercy of God is everywhere great, let us bless Him, and also because He has sent unto us the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to guide us into all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the month Abib was appointed by the law to be the beginning of months, and was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto us as the first among the months of the year; both by the ancient writers who lived before, and by the later who lived after the destruction of Jerusalem, it was shown to possess a most clear and evidently definite period, especially because in some places the reaping is early, and sometimes it is late, so as to be sometimes before the time and sometimes after it, as it happened in the very beginning of the giving of the law, before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, according as it is written, <q>But the wheat and the rye were not smitten, for they were not grown up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062298"><a href="../bible/exo009.htm#verse32">Exodus 9:32</a></span> Whence it is rightly prescribed by the law, that from the vernal equinox, in whatsoever week the fourteenth day of the first month shall fall, in it the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> is to be celebrated, becoming and conformable songs of praise having been first taken up for its celebration. For this first month, says he, <q>shall be unto you the beginning of months,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062299"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse2">Exodus 12:2</a></span> when the sun in the summer-time sends forth a far stronger and clearer light, and the days are lengthened and become longer, while the nights are contracted and shortened. Moreover, when the new seeds have sprung up, they are thoroughly purged, and borne into the threshing floor; nor only this, but also all the shrubs blossom, and burst forth into flower. Immediately therefore they are discovered to send forth in alternation various and diverse fruits, so that the grape-clusters are found at thattime; as says the lawgiver, <q>Now, it was the time of spring, of the first ripe grapes; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note062300"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse24">Numbers 12:24</a></span> and when he sent the men to spy out the land, they brought, on bearers, a large cluster of grapes, and pomegranates also, and figs. For then, as they say, our <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> God also, the Maker and Creator of all things, framed all things, and said to them, <q>Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself upon the earth</q> Then he adds, <q>And it was so; and God saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q>  Moreover, he makes quite clear that the first month among the Hebrews was appointed by law, which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been observed by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> up to the destruction of Jerusalem, because this has been so handed down by the Hebrew tradition. But after the destruction of the city it was mocked at by some hardening of heart, which we observing, according to the law, with sincerity have received; and in this, according to the Word, when he speaks of the day of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> festivity, which the election bath attained: but the rest have become hardened,  as said the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>; and after other things.</p>

<p>2. And He says as follows: <q>All these things will they do unto you for My name's sake, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not Him that sent Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062303"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse21">John 15:21</a></span> But if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not Him who sent, and Him who was sent, there is no reason to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that they have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> as prescribed by the law, so as not merely to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in their choice of the place, but also in reckoning the beginning of the month, which is the first among the months of the year, on the fourteenth day of which, being accurately observed, after the equinox, the ancients celebrated the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> according to the divine command; whereas the men of the present day now celebrate it before the equinox, and that altogether through negligence and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> how they celebrated it in its season, as He confesses who in these things was described.</p>

<p>3. Whether therefore the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> erroneously sometimes celebrate their <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> according to the course of the moon in the month Phamenoth, or according to the intercalary month, every third year in the month Pharmuthi  matters not to us. For we have no other object than to keep the remembrance of His Passion, and that at this very time; as those who were eye-witnesses of it have from the beginning handed down, before the Egyptians <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For neither by observing the course of the moon do they necessarily celebrate it on the sixteenth day of Phamenoth, but once every three years in the month Pharmuthi; for from the beginning, and before the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they seem to have so done. Hence, when the Lord reproves them by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, He says, <q>They do always <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in their heart; and I have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> in My <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that they shall not enter into My rest.</q> </p>

<p>4. Wherefore, as you see, even in this you appear to be lying greatly, not only against men, but also against God. First, indeed, since in this matter the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> never erred, as consorting with those who were eye-witnesses and ministers, much less from the beginning before the advent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For God does not say that they did always <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in their heart as regards the precept of the law concerning the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, as you have written, but on account of all their other disobedience, and on account of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and unseemly <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, when, indeed, He perceived them turning to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and to fornication.</p>

<p>5. And after a few things. So that also in this respect, since you have slumbered, rouse yourself much, and very much, with the scourge of the Preacher, being mindful especially of that passage where he speaks of <q>slipping on the pavement, and with the tongue.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062306"><a href="../bible/sir020.htm#verse18">Sirach 20:18</a></span> For, as you see again, the charge cast by you upon their leaders is reflected back; nay, and one may suspect a great subsequent danger, inasmuch as we hear that the stone which a man casts up on high falls back upon his head. Much more reckless is he who, in this respect, ventures to bring a charge against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that might), servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or Joshua, the son of Nun. who succeeded him, or those who in succession rightly followed them and ruled; the judges, I mean, and the kings who appeared, or the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> inspired, and those who among the high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were blameless, and those who, in following the traditions, changed nothing, but agreed as to the observance of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> in its season, as also of the rest of their feasts.</p>

<p>6. And after other things. But you ought rather to have pursued a safer and more auspicious course, and not to have mitten rashly and slanderously, that they seem from the beginning, and always, to have been in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> about the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, which you cannot prove, whatever charge you may wish to bring against those who, at the present time, have erred with a grievous wandering, having fallen away from the commandment of the law concerning the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> and other things. For the ancients seem to have kept it after the vernal equinox, which you can discover if you read ancient books, and those especially which were written by the learned Hebrews.</p>

<p>7. That therefore up to the period of the Lord's Passion, and at the time of the last destruction of Jerusalem, which happened under <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a>, the Roman emperor, the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, rightly observing the fourteenth day of the first lunar month, celebrated on it the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> of the law, has been briefly demonstrated.Therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and all, as I have said, who righteously and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> walked in the law of the Lord, together with the entire people, celebrated a typical and shadowy <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, the Creator and Lord of every visible and invisible creature, the only-begotten Son, and the Word co-eternal with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and of the same substance with them, according to His divine nature, our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, being in the end of the world born according to the flesh of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> lady, <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>, and Ever-Virgin, and, of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of Mary the <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>; and being seen upon earth, and having <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and real converse as man with men, who were of the same substance with Him, according to His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, Himself also, with the people, in the years before His public ministry and during His public ministry, did celebrate the legal and shadowy <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, eating the typical lamb. For <q>I came not to destroy the law, or the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but to fulfil them,</q> the Saviour Himself said in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>But after His public ministry He did not eat of the lamb,  but Himself suffered as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lamb in the Paschal feast, as John, the divine and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, teaches us in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> written by him, where he thus speaks: <q>Then led they Jesus from <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment-hall, lest they should be defined, but that they might eat the passover.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062308"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse28">John 18:28</a></span> And after a few things more. <q>When <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down in the judgment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>,</q>  as the correct books render it, and the copy itself that was written by the hand of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, which, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, has been preserved in the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church of Ephesus, and is there adored by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. And again the same <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> (for that <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> was an high day), besought <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062310"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse31">John 19:31</a></span> On that day, therefore, on which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were about to eat the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> in the evening, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> was crucified, being made the victim to those who were about to partake by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> concerning Him, according to what is written by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>: <q>For even Christ our <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Passover</a> is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for us; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note062311"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 5:7</a></span> and not as some who, carried along by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, confidently affirm that after He had eaten the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, He was betrayed; which we neither learn from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, nor has any of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> handed it down to us. At the time, therefore, in which our Lord and God <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> suffered for us, according to the flesh, He did not eat of the legal <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>; but, as I have said, He Himself, as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lamb, was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for us in the feast of the typical <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, on the day of the preparation, the fourteenth of the first lunar month. The typical <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, therefore, then ceased, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> being present: <q>For Christ our <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Passover</a> was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for us,</q> as has been before said, and as that chosen vessel, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, teaches. </p>

<h3>2</h3> 

<p>Now it was the preparation, about the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, as the accurate books have it, and the autograph copy itself of the Evangelist John, which up to this day has by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> been preserved in the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church of Ephesus, and is there adored  by the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>.</p>

<h2>6. Of the Soul and Body</h2> 

<p>The things which pertain to the divinity and humanity of the Second Man from heaven, in what has been written above, according to the blessed apostle, we have explained; and now we have thought it necessary to explain the things which pertain to the first man, who is of earth and earthy, being about, namely, to demonstrate this, that he was created at the same time one and the same, although sometimes he is separately designated as the man external and internal. For if, according to the Word of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, He who made what is without, made also that which is within, He certainly, by one operation, and at the same time, made both, on that day, indeed, on which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> said, <q>Let us <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">make</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in our image, after our likeness; </q> <span class="stiki" id="note062316"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse26">Genesis 1:26</a></span> whence it is manifest that man was not formed by a conjunction of the body with a certain pre-existent type. For if the earth, at the bidding of the Creator, brought forth the other animals endowed with life, much rather did the dust which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> took from the earth receive a vital energy from the will and operation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>7. Fragment</h2> 

<p>Wretch that I am! I have not remembered that God observes the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and hears the voice of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. I turned consciously to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, saying to myself, God is merciful, and will bear with me; and when I was not instantly smitten, I ceased not, but rather despised His forbearance, and exhausted the long-suffering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>8. On St. Matthew</h2> 

<p>And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> according to Matthew, the Lord said to him who betrayed Him: <q>Do you betray the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>? </q>which Peter the Martyr and Archbishop of Alexandria expounding, says, this and other things like, <q>All the signs which He showed, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that He did, testify of Him that He is God incarnate; both things therefore are together <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, that He was God by nature, and was made man by nature.</q></p>

<h2>9. From a Sermon</h2> 

<p>In the meanwhile the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says with firmness, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062320"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John 1:14</a></span> From this we learn that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, when he saluted the Virgin with the words, <q>Hail, you that are highly favoured, the Lord is with you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062321"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse28">Luke 1:28</a></span> intended to signify <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is with you, and also to show that He would arise from her bosom, and would be made flesh, even as it is written, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you; therefore also that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing which shall be born of you shall be called the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note062322"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke 1:35</a></span></p>
