<h1>Fragments from the Lost Writings of Iren&aelig;us</h1>

<h2>1</h2>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you, who shall transcribe this book,  by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and by His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> appearing, when He comes to judge the living and the dead, that you compare what you have transcribed, and be careful to set it right according to this copy from which you have transcribed; also, that you in like manner copy down this <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjuration</a>, and insert it in the transcript.</p>

<h2>2</h2>

<p>These  opinions, Florinus, that I may speak in mild terms, are not of sound doctrine; these opinions are not consonant to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and involve their votaries in the utmost impiety; these opinions, even the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> beyond the Church's pale have never ventured to broach; these opinions, those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who preceded us, and who were conversant with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, did not hand down to you. For, while I was yet a boy, I saw you in Lower Asia with <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, distinguishing yourself in the royal court,  and endeavouring to gain his approbation. For I have a more vivid recollection of what occurred at that time than of recent events (inasmuch as the experiences of childhood, keeping pace with the growth of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, become incorporated with it); so that I can even describe the place where the blessed <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> used to sit and discourse&mdash; his going out, too, and his coming in&mdash; his general mode of life and personal appearance, together with the discourses which he delivered to the people; also how he would speak of his familiar intercourse with John, and with the rest of those who had seen the Lord; and how he would call their words to remembrance. Whatsoever things he had heard from them respecting the Lord, both with regard to His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and His teaching, <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> having thus received [information] from the eye-witnesses of the Word of life, would recount them all in harmony with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. These things, through, God's mercy which was upon me, I then listened to attentively, and treasured them up not on paper, but in my heart; and I am continually, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, revolving these things accurately in my mind. And I can bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that if that blessed and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> had heard any such thing, he would have cried out, and stopped his ears, exclaiming as he was wont to do: <q>O good <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for what times have You reserved me, that I should endure these things?</q> And he would have fled from the very spot where, sitting or standing, he had heard such words. This fact, too, can be made clear, from his Epistles which he dispatched, whether to the neighbouring Churches to confirm them, or to certain of the brethren, admonishing and exhorting them.</p>

<h2>3</h2>

<p>For  the controversy is not merely as regards the day, but also as regards the form itself of the fast.  For some consider themselves bound to fast one day, others two days, others still more, while others [do so during] forty: the diurnal and the nocturnal hours they measure out together as their [<a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>] day.  And this variety among the observers [of the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>] had not its origin in our time, but long before in that of our predecessors, some of whom probably, being not very accurate in their observance of it,  handed down to posterity the custom as it had, through simplicity or private fancy, been [introduced among them]. And yet nevertheless all these lived in peace one with another, and we also keep peace together. Thus, in fact, the difference [in observing] the fast establishes the harmony of [our common] <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> preceding <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Soter</a> in the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which you now rule&mdash; I mean, <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> and <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a>, <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Hyginus</a> and <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus</a>, and Sixtus&mdash; did neither themselves observe it [after that fashion], nor permit those with them  to do so. Notwithstanding this, those who did not keep [the feast in this way] were peacefully disposed towards those who came to them from other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> in which it was [so] observed although such observance was [felt] in more decided contrariety [as presented] to those who did not fall in with it; and none were ever cast out [of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>] for this matter. On the contrary, those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who preceded you, and who did not observe [this custom], sent the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a> to those of other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> who did observe it.  And when the blessed <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> was sojourning in Rome in the time of <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>, although a slight controversy had arisen among them as to certain other points, they were at once well inclined towards each other [with regard to the matter in hand], not willing that any quarrel should arise between them upon this head. For neither could <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> persuade <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> to forego the observance [in his own way], inasmuch as these things had been always [so] observed by John the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of our Lord, and by other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with whom he had been conversant; nor, on the other hand, could <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> succeed in persuading <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> to keep [the observance in his way], for he maintained that he was bound to adhere to the usage of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> who preceded him. And in this state of affairs they held fellowship with each other; and <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a> conceded to <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/05572c.htm">Eucharist</a>, by way of showing him respect; so that they parted in peace one from the other, maintaining peace with the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, both those who did observe [this custom] and those who did not. </p>

<h2>4</h2>

<p>As  long as any one has the means of doing good to his neighbours, and does not do so, he shall be reckoned a stranger to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Lord. </p>

<h2>5</h2>

<p>The  will and the energy of God is the effective and foreseeing <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of every time and place and age, and of every nature. The will is the reason (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F79;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) of the intellectual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which [reason] is within us, inasmuch as it is the faculty belonging to it which is endowed with freedom of action. The will is the mind desiring [some object], and an appetite possessed of intelligence, yearning after that thing which is desired.</p>

<h2>6</h2>

<p>Since  God is vast, and the Architect of the world, and <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>, He <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things that reach to immensity both by the Architect of the world and by an <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> will, and with a new effect, potently and efficaciously, in order that the entire fullness of those things which have been produced might come into being, although they had no previous <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>&mdash; that is, whatever does not fall under [our] observation, and also what lies before our eyes. And so does He contain all things in particular, and leads them on to their own proper result, on account of which they were called into being and produced, in no way changed into anything else than what it (the end) had originally been by nature. For this is the property of the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not merely to proceed to the infinitude of the understanding, or even to overpass [our] powers of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, reason and speech, time and place, and every age; but also to go beyond substance, and fullness or perfection.</p>

<h2>7</h2>

<p>This  [custom], of not bending the knee upon Sunday, is a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the resurrection, through which we have been set free, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and from death, which has been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> under Him. Now this custom took its rise from <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> times, as the blessed <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">Lyons</a>, declares in his treatise <em>On <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a></em>, in which he makes mention of Pentecost also; upon which [feast] we do not bend the knee, because it is  of equal significance with the Lord's day, for the reason already alleged concerning it.</p>

<h2>8</h2>

<p>For  as the ark [of the covenant] was gilded within and without with pure gold, so was also the body of Christ pure and resplendent; for it was adorned within by the Word, and shielded without by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in order that from both [materials] the splendour of the natures might be clearly shown forth.</p>

<h2>9</h2>

<p>Ever,  indeed, speaking well of the deserving, but never ill of the undeserving, we also shall attain to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</p>

<h2>10</h2>

<p>It is indeed proper to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and befitting His character, to show mercy and pity, and to bring <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to His creatures, even though they be brought under danger of destruction. <q>For with Him,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>is propitiation.</q> </p>

<h2>11</h2>

<p>The business of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is nothing else than to be ever preparing for death (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03C0;&#x1FB7;&#x03BD; &#x1F00;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B8;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>).</p>

<h2>12</h2>

<p>We therefore have formed the belief that [our] bodies also do rise again. For although they go to corruption, yet they do not perish; for the earth, receiving the remains, preserves them, even like fertile seed mixed with more fertile ground. Again, as a bare grain is sown, and, germinating by the command of God its Creator, rises again, clothed upon and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, but not before it has died and suffered decomposition, and become mingled with the earth; so [it is seen from this, that] we have not entertained a vain belief in the resurrection of the body. But although it is dissolved at the appointed time, because of the primeval disobedience, it is placed, as it were, in the crucible of the earth, to be recast again; not then as this corruptible [body], but pure, and no longer subject to decay: so that to each body its own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be restored; and when it is clothed upon with this, it shall not experience sorrow, but shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, continuing permanently in a state of purity, having for its companion a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> consort, not an insidious one, possessing in every respect the things pertaining to it, it shall receive these with perfect accuracy;  it shall not receive bodies diverse from what they had been, nor delivered from suffering or disease, nor as [rendered] <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, but as they departed this life, in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> or in righteous actions: and such as they were, such shall they be clothed with upon resuming life; and such as they were in unbelief, such shall they be faithfully judged.</p>

<h2>13</h2>

<p>For  when the Greeks, having arrested the slaves of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>, then used force against them, in order to learn from them some secret thing [practised] among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, these slaves, having nothing to say that would meet the wishes of their tormentors, except that they had heard from their masters that the divine communion was the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and imagining that it was actually flesh and blood, gave their inquisitors answer to that effect. Then these latter, assuming such to be the case with regard to the practices of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, gave information regarding it to other Greeks, and sought to compel the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> Sanctus and <a href="../cathen/02594a.htm">Blandina</a> to confess, under the influence of torture, [that the allegation was correct]. To these men <a href="../cathen/02594a.htm">Blandina</a> replied very admirably in these words: <q>How should those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> endure such [accusations], who, for the sake of the practice [of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>], did not avail themselves even of the flesh that was permitted [them to eat]?</q></p>

<h2>14</h2>

<p>How  is it possible to say that the serpent, created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> dumb and irrational, was endowed with reason and speech? For if it had the power of itself to speak, to discern, to understand, and to reply to what was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, there would have been nothing to prevent every serpent from doing this also. If, however, they say again that it was according to the divine will and dispensation that this [serpent] spoke with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice to Eve, they render God the author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Neither was it possible for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> to impart speech to a speechless nature, and thus from that which is not to produce that which is; for if that were the case, he never would have ceased (with the view of leading men astray) from conferring with and deceiving them by means of serpents, and beasts, and birds. From what quarter, too, did it, being a beast, obtain information regarding the injunction  of God to the man given to him alone, and in secret, not even the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> herself being aware of it? Why also did it not prefer to make its attack upon the man instead of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? And if you say that it attacked her as being the weaker of the two, [I reply that], on the contrary, she was the stronger, since she appears to have been the helper of the man in the transgression of the commandment. For she did by herself alone resist the serpent, and it was after holding out for a while and making opposition that she ate of the tree, being circumvented by craft; whereas Adam, making no fight whatever, nor refusal, partook of the fruit handed to him by the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, which is an indication of the utmost imbecility and effeminacy of mind. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> indeed, having been vanquished in the contest by a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, is deserving of pardon; but <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> shall deserve none, for he was worsted by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>&mdash;he who, in his own person, had received the command from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, having heard of the command from Adam, treated it with contempt, either because she deemed it unworthy of God to speak by means of it, or because she had her doubts, perhaps even held the opinion that the command was given to her by <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> of his own accord. The serpent found her working alone, so that he was enabled to confer with her apart. Observing her then either eating or not eating from the trees, he put before her the fruit of the [forbidden] tree. And if he saw her eating, it is manifest that she was partaker of a body subject to corruption. <q>For everything going in at the mouth, is cast out into the draught.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014818"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;15:17</a></span> If then corruptible, it is obvious that she was also mortal. But if mortal, then there was certainly no curse; nor was that a [condemnatory] sentence, when the voice of God spoke to the man, <q>For earth you are, and unto earth shall you return,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014819"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> course of things proceeds [now and always]. Then again, if the serpent observed the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> not eating, how did he induce her to eat who never had eaten? And who pointed out to this accursed man-slaying serpent that the sentence of death pronounced against them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> would not take [immediate] effect, when He said, <q>For in the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die?</q> And not this merely, but that along with the impunity  [attending their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>] the eyes of those should be opened who had not seen until then? But with the opening [of their eyes] referred to, they made entrance upon the path of death.</p>

<h2>15</h2>

<p>When,  in times of old, Balaam spoke these things in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, he was not acknowledged; and now, when Christ has appeared and fulfilled them, He was not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Wherefore [Balaam], foreseeing this, and wondering at it, exclaimed, <q>Alas! Alas! Who shall live when God brings these things to pass?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014822"><a href="../bible/num024.htm#verse23">Numbers&nbsp;24:23</a></span> </p>

<h2>16</h2>

<p>Expounding again the law to that generation which followed those who were slain in the wilderness, he published Deuteronomy; not as giving to them a different law from that which had been appointed for their fathers, but as recapitulating this latter, in order that they, by hearing what had happened to their fathers, might <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God with their whole heart.</p>

<h2>17</h2>

<p>By these Christ was typified, and acknowledged, and brought into the world; for He was prefigured in Joseph: then from Levi and Judah He was descended according to the flesh, as King and Priest; and He was acknowledged by Simeon in the temple: through Zebulon He was <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, as says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>the land of Zabulon;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014823"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;9:1</a></span> and through Benjamin [that is, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>] He was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, by being preached throughout all the world. </p>

<h2>18</h2>

<p>And this was not without meaning; but that by means of the number of the ten men,  he (Gideon) might appear as having Jesus for a helper, as [is indicated] by the compact entered into with them. And when he did not choose to partake with them in their idol-worship, they threw the blame upon him: for <q>Jerubbaal</q> signifies the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>.</p>

<h2>19</h2>

<p><q>Take unto you Joshua (<span class="greek">&#x1FBF;&#x0399;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03BD;</span>) the son of Nun.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014826"><a href="../bible/num027.htm#verse18">Numbers&nbsp;27:18</a></span> For it was proper that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should lead the people out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, but that Jesus (<em>Joshua</em>) should lead them into the inheritance. Also that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as was the case with the law, should cease to be, but that Joshua (<span class="greek">&#x1FBF;&#x0399;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03BD;</span>), as the word, and no untrue type of the Word made  flesh (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BD;&#x03C5;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;</span>), should be a preacher to the people.

<p><q>And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place.

For the Judge of the whole world is thus proclaimed, who, having been hidden in the heart of the earth in a tomb for three days, and having become a great tree, has stretched forth His branches to the ends of the earth. Sprouting out from Him, the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, having become fair and fruitful boughs, were made a shelter for the nations as for the fowls of heaven, under which boughs, all having taken refuge, as birds flocking to a nest, have been made partakers of that wholesome and celestial food which is derived from them.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a> says, that when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had been brought up in the royal palaces, he was chosen as general against the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>; and having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> victorious, obtained in marriage the daughter of that king, since indeed, out of her affection for him, she delivered the city up to him. </p>

<p>Why was it, that when these two (<a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and Miriam) had both acted with despite towards him (<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>), the latter alone was adjudged punishment? <span class="stiki" id="note014851"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse1">Numbers&nbsp;12:1</a>,&nbsp;etc.</span> First, because the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was the more culpable, since both nature and the law place the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in a subordinate condition to the man. Or perhaps it was that <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was to a certain degree excusable, in consideration of his being the elder [brother], and adorned with the dignity of <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>. Then again, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> was accounted by the law unclean, while at the same time the origin and foundation of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> lay in <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, [the Lord] did not award a similar punishment to him, lest this stigma should attach itself to the entire [sacerdotal] race; but by means of his sister's [example] He awoke his fears, and taught him the same lesson. For Miriam's punishment affected him to such an extent, that no sooner did she experience it, than he entreated [<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>], who had been injured, that he would by his intercession do away with the affliction. And he did not neglect to do so, but at once poured forth his supplication. Upon this the Lord, who loves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, made him understand how He had not chastened her as a judge, but as a father; for He said, <q>If her father had spit in her face, should she not be ashamed?

<p>Inasmuch  as certain men, impelled by what considerations I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, remove from God the half of His creative power, by asserting that He is merely the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of quality resident in matter, and by maintaining that matter itself is uncreated, come now let us put the question, What is at any time ... is immutable. Matter, then, is immutable. But if matter be immutable, and the immutable suffers no change in regard to quality, it does not form the substance of the world. For which reason it seems to them superfluous, that God has annexed qualities to matter, since indeed matter admits of no possible alteration, it being in itself an uncreated thing. But further, if matter be uncreated, it has been made altogether according to a certain  quality, and this immutable, so that it cannot be receptive of more qualities, nor can it be the thing of which the world is made. But if the world be not made from it, [this theory] entirely excludes God from exercising power on the creation [of the world].</p>

First of all, by his betaking himself to the Rock <span class="stiki" id="note014885"><a href="../bible/jdg015.htm#verse11">Judges&nbsp;15:11</a></span> not cognizable to the senses;  secondly, by the finding of the jaw-bone of an ass. Now the type of the jaw-bone is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking always well of the worthy, but never ill of the unworthy, we also shall attain to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</p>

<h2>43</h2>

<p>In  these things there was signified by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that the people, having become transgressors, shall be bound by the chains of their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But the breaking of the bonds of their own accord indicates that, upon repentance, they shall be again loosed from the shackles of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>44</h2>

<p>It  is not an easy thing for a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, under the influence of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, to be persuaded of the contrary opinion.</p>

<h2>45</h2>

<p><q>And  Balaam the son of Beor they slew with the sword.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014890"><a href="../bible/num031.htm#verse8">Numbers&nbsp;31:8</a></span> For, speaking no longer by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, but setting up another law of fornication contrary to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note014891"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse14">Revelation&nbsp;2:14</a></span> this man shall no longer be reckoned as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but as a soothsayer. For, as he did not continue in the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he received the just reward of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> devices.</p>

<h2>46</h2>

<p><q>The  god of the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014893"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:4</a></span> that is, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, who was designated God to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</p>

<h2>47</h2>

<p>The  birth of John [the Baptist] brought the dumbness of Zacharias to an end. For he did not burden his father, when the voice issued forth from silence; but as when not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it rendered him tongue-tied, so did the voice sounding out clearly set his father free, to whom he had both been announced and born. Now the voice and the burning light <span class="stiki" id="note014895"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;5:35</a></span> were a precursor of the Word and the Light.</p>

<h2>48</h2>

<p>As  therefore seventy tongues are indicated by number, and from  dispersion the tongues are gathered into one by means of their interpretation; so is that ark declared a type of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is both pure and immaculate. For  as that ark was gilded with pure gold both within and without, so also is the body of Christ pure and resplendent, being adorned within by the Word, and shielded on the outside by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in order that from both [materials] the splendour of the natures might be exhibited together.</p>

<h2>49</h2>

<p>Now  therefore, by means of this which has been already brought forth a long time since, the Word has assigned an interpretation. We are convinced that there exist [so to speak] two men in each one of us. The one is confessedly a hidden thing, while the other stands apparent; one is corporeal, the other spiritual; although the generation of both may be compared to that of twins. For both are revealed to the world as but one, for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not anterior to the body in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; nor, in regard to its formation, did the body precede the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but both these were produced at one time; and their nourishment consists in purity and sweetness.</p>

<h2>50</h2>

<p>For  then there shall in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be a common <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> consummated to all those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unto life, and in each individual shall be confirmed the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Resurrection, and the hope of incorruption, and the commencement of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> kingdom, when God shall have destroyed death and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and flesh which has risen again from the dead shall die no more; but after it had been changed to incorruption, and made like to spirit, when the heaven was opened, [our Lord] full of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> offered it (the flesh) to the Father.</p>

<h2>51</h2>

<p>Now,  however, inasmuch as the books of these men may possibly have escaped your observation, but have come under our notice, I call your attention to them, that for the sake of your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> you may expel these writings from among you, as bringing disgrace upon you, since their author boasts himself as being one of your company. For they constitute a stumbling-block to many, who simply and unreservedly receive, as coming from a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> which they utter against God. Just [consider] the writer of these things, how by means of them he does not injure assistants [in divine service] only, who happen to be prepared in mind for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also damages those among us, since by his books he imbues their minds with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrines</a> concerning God.</p>

<h2>52</h2>

<p>The  sacred books acknowledge with regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that as He is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, so is the same Being not a [mere] man; and as He is flesh, so is He also spirit, and the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and God. And as He was born of Mary in the last times, so did He also proceed from God as the First-begotten of every creature; and as He hungered, so did He satisfy [others]; and as He thirsted, so did He of old <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to drink, for the <q>Rock was Christ</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014903"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> Himself: thus does Jesus now give to His believing people power to drink spiritual waters, which spring up to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note014904"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span> And as He was the son of David, so was He also the Lord of David. And as He was from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, so did He also exist before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note014905"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse58">John&nbsp;8:58</a></span> And as He was the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so is He the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. And as He was spit upon ignominiously, so also did He breathe the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> into His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note014906"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22</a></span> And as He was saddened, so also did He give <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to His people. And as He was capable of being handled and touched, so again did He, in a non-apprehensible form, pass through the midst of those who sought to injure Him, <span class="stiki" id="note014907"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse59">John&nbsp;8:59</a></span> and entered without impediment through closed doors. <span class="stiki" id="note014908"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;20:26</a></span> And as He slept, so did He also rule the sea, the winds, and the storms. And as He suffered, so also is He alive, and life-giving, and healing all our infirmity. And as He died, so is He also the Resurrection of the dead. He suffered shame on earth, while He is higher than all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and praise in heaven; who, <q>though He was crucified through weakness, yet He lives by divine power;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014909"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:4</a></span> who <q>descended into the lower parts of the earth,</q> and who <q>ascended up above the heavens;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014910"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse9">Ephesians&nbsp;4:9-10</a></span> for whom a manger  sufficed, yet who filled all things; who was dead, yet who lives for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>53</h2>

<p>With  regard to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> have proclaimed that He was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, that He suffered upon a beam of wood, and that He appeared from the dead; that He also ascended to the heavens, and was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and is the Eternal King; that He is the perfect Intelligence, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, who was begotten before the light; that He was the Founder of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, along with it (light), and the Maker of man; that He is All in all: Patriarch among the patriarchs; Law in the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; Chief Priest among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; Ruler among kings; the Prophet among <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; the Angel among <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; the Man among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; Son in the Father; God in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; King to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. For it is He who sailed [in the ark] along with <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and who guided <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; who was bound along with Isaac, and was a Wanderer with Jacob; the Shepherd of those who are saved, and the Bridegroom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the Chief also of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, the Prince of the angelic powers; God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; Son of the Father; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; King for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>54</h2>

<p>The  law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> have declared that Christ was born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and suffered on the cross; was raised also from the dead, and taken up to heaven; that He was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and reigns for ever. He is Himself termed the Perfect Intellect, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. He is the First-begotten,  after a transcendent manner, the Creator of man; All in all; Patriarch among the patriarchs; Law in the law; the Priest among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; among kings Prime Leader; the Prophet among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; the Angel among <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; the Man among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; Son in the Father; God in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; King to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. He was sold with Joseph, and He guided <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; was bound along with Isaac, and wandered with Jacob; with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> He was Leader, and, respecting the people, Legislator. He preached in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; was incarnate of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>; born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>; received by John, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Jordan; was tempted in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be the Lord. He gathered the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> together, and preached the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; gave light to the blind, and raised the dead; was seen in the temple, but was not held by the people as worthy of credit; was arrested by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, conducted before <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and condemned in the presence of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>; He manifested Himself in the body, was suspended upon a beam of wood, and raised from the dead; shown to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and, having been carried up to heaven, sits on the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and has been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by Him as the Resurrection of the dead. Moreover, He is the Salvation of the lost, the Light to those dwelling in darkness, and Redemption to those who have been born; the Shepherd of the saved, and the Bridegroom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; the Charioteer of the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>, the Leader of the angelic host; God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Saviour.</p>

<h2>55</h2>

<p><q>Then  drew near unto Him the mother of Zebedee's children, with her sons, worshipping, and seeking a certain thing from Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014915"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;20:20</a></span> These people are certainly not void of understanding, nor are the words set forth in that passage of no signification: being stated beforehand like a preface, they have some agreement with those points formerly expounded.</p>

<p><q>Then drew near.</q> Sometimes <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> excites our admiration, not merely on account of the display which is given of it, but also of the occasion when it was manifested. I may refer, for example, to the premature fruit of the grape, or of the fig, or to any fruit whatsoever, from which, during its process [of growth], no man expects maturity or full development; yet, although any one may perceive that it is still somewhat imperfect, he does not for that reason despise as useless the immature grape when plucked, but he gathers it with pleasure as appearing early in the season; nor does he consider whether the grape is possessed of perfect sweetness; nay, he at once experiences satisfaction from the thought that this one has appeared before the rest. Just in the same way does God also, when He perceives the faithful possessing wisdom though still imperfect, and but a small degree of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, overlook their defect in this respect, and therefore does not reject them; nay, but on the contrary, He kindly welcomes and accepts them as premature fruits, and honours the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whatsoever it may be, which is stamped with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, although not yet perfect. He makes allowance for it, as being among the harbingers of the vintage,  and esteems it highly, inasmuch as, being of a readier disposition than the rest, it has forestalled, as it were, the blessing to itself.</p>

<p>  <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> therefore, Isaac, and Jacob, our fathers, are to be esteemed before all, since they did indeed afford us such early examples of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. How many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> can be compared to Daniel? How many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, I ask, can rival the three youths in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, although the memory of the former has not been brought before us so conspicuously as that of the latter? These were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, and indications of the [succeeding] fructification. Hence God has directed their life to be recorded, as a model for those who should come after.</p>

<p>And that their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was thus accepted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the produce, hear what He has Himself declared: <q>As a grape,</q> He says, <q>I have found <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in the wilderness, and as first-ripe figs your fathers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014917"><a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse10">Hosea&nbsp;9:10</a></span> Call not therefore the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> merely blessed because he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Do you wish to look upon <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> with admiration? Then behold how that one man alone professed <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> when in the world six hundred had been contaminated with <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Do you wish Daniel to carry you away to amazement? Behold that [city] <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> in the flower and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of impiousness, and its inhabitants completely given over to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of every description. But he, emerging from the depth, spat out the brine of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and rejoiced to plunge into the sweet waters of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. And now, in like manner, with regard to that mother of Zebedee's children, do not admire merely what she said, but also the time at which she uttered these words. For when was it that she drew near to the Redeemer? Not after the resurrection, nor after the preaching of His name, nor after the establishment of His kingdom; but it was when the Lord said, <q>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> shall be delivered to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>; and they shall kill Him, and on the third day He shall rise again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note014918"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;20:18-19</a></span> </p>

<p>These things the Saviour told in reference to His sufferings and cross; to these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> He predicted His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. Nor did He conceal the fact that it should be of a most ignominious kind, at the hands of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, however, had attached another meaning to the dispensation of His sufferings. The Saviour was foretelling death; and she asked for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. The Lord was asserting that He must stand arraigned before impious judges; but she, taking no note of that judgment, requested as of the judge: <q>Grant,</q> she said, <q>that these my two sons may sit, one on the right hand, and the other on the left, in Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> In the one case the passion is referred to, in the other the kingdom is understood. The Saviour was speaking of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, while she had in view the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which admits no suffering. This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, therefore, as I have already said, is worthy of our admiration, not merely for what she sought, but also for the occasion of her making the request.</p>

<p>She did indeed suffer, not merely as a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> person, but also as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For, having been instructed by His words, she considered and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it would come to pass, that the kingdom of Christ should flourish in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and walk in its vastness throughout the world, and be increased by the preaching of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. She understood, as was [in fact] the case, that He who appeared in a lowly guise had delivered and received every promise. I will inquire upon another occasion, when I come to treat upon this humility, whether the Lord rejected her petition concerning His kingdom. But she thought that the same confidence would not be possessed by her, when, at the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, He should be ministered to by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and receive service from the entire heavenly host. Taking the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, therefore, apart in a retired place, she earnestly desired of Him those things which transcend every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>.</p>
