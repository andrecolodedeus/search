<h1>Fragments of St. Justin Martyr</h1>

<h2>1</h2>

<p>The most admirable <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> rightly declared that the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>  resembled <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>.&mdash; <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>'s <em>Address to the Greeks</em>, chap. xviii.</p>

<h2>2</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> well said in his book against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, that he would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the Lord Himself, if He had announced any other God than the Fashioner and Maker [of the world], and our Nourisher. But since, from the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who both made this world and formed us, and contains as well as administers all things, there came to us the only-begotten Son, summing up His own workmanship in Himself, my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him is steadfast, and my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards the Father is immoveable, God bestowing both upon us.&mdash; <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a></span>: <em>Heresies</em>, iv. 6.</p>

<h2>3</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> well said: Before the advent of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> never ventured to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as he was not yet sure of his own damnation, since that was announced concerning him by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> only in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and allegories. But after the advent of the Lord learning plainly from the discourses of Christ and His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> was prepared for him who voluntarily departed from God and for all who, without repentance, persevere in <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, then, by means of a man of this sort, he, as if already condemned, blasphemes that God who inflicts judgment upon him, and imputes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a> to his Maker, instead of to his own will and predilection.&mdash; <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a></span>: <em>Heresies</em>, v. 26.</p>

<h2>4</h2>

<p>Expounding the reason of the incessant plotting of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> against us, he declares: Before the advent of the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> did not so plainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the measure of his own punishment, inasmuch as the divine <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had but enigmatically announced it; as, for instance, Isaiah, who in the person of the Assyrian tragically revealed the course to be followed against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But when the Lord appeared, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> clearly understood that <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> was laid up and prepared for him and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, he then began to plot without ceasing against the faithful, being desirous to have many companions in his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, that he might not by himself endure the shame of condemnation, comforting himself by this cold and malicious consolation.&mdash; <em>From the writings of</em> <span class="sc">John of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a></span> .</p>

<h2>5</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin of Neapolis</a>, a man who was not far separated from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> either in age or excellence, says that that which is mortal is inherited, but that which is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> inherits; and that the flesh indeed dies, but the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> lives.&mdash; <em>From</em> <span class="sc">Methodius</span> <em>On the Resurrection, in Photius</em>.</p>

<h2>6</h2>

<p>Neither is there straitness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor anything that is not absolutely perfect.&mdash; <em>From manuscript of the writings of</em> <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a></span> .</p>

<h2>7</h2>

<p>We shall not injure God by remaining <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him, but shall deprive ourselves of His friendship.</p>

<h2>8</h2>

<p>The unskilfulness of the teacher proves destructive to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and the carelessness of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> entails danger on the teacher, and especially should they owe their negligence to his want of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<h2>9</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> can with difficulty be recalled to those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things from which it has fallen, and  is with difficulty dragged away from those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to which it has become accustomed. If at any time you show a disposition to blame yourself, then perhaps, through the medicine of repentance, I should cherish good hopes regarding you. But when you altogether despise <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and reject with scorn the very <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it were better for you that you had never been born from the womb.&mdash; <em>From the writings of</em> <span class="sc">John of Damascus</span> .</p>

<h2>10</h2>

<p>By the two birds  Christ is denoted, both dead as man, and living as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He is likened to a bird, because He is understood and declared to be from above, and from heaven. And the living bird, having been dipped in the blood of the dead one, was afterwards let go. For the living and divine Word was in the crucified and dead temple [of the body], as being a partaker of the passion, and yet impassible to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>By that which took place in the running  water, in which the wood and the <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a> and the scarlet were dipped, is set forth the bloody passion of Christ on the cross for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who are sprinkled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the water, and the blood. Wherefore the material for purification was not provided chiefly with reference to <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, but with regard to the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that both <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> might be understood to be an emblem of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the things which were <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> an emblem of Him who was to be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>For this reason, consequently, he ordered that the scarlet should be dipped at the same time in the water, thus predicting that the flesh should no longer possess its natural [<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>] properties. For this reason, also, were there the two birds, the one being <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in the water, and the other dipped both in the blood and in the water and then sent away, just as is narrated also respecting the goats.</p>

<p>The goat that was sent away presented a type of Him who takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of men. But the two contained a representation of the one economy of God incarnate. For He was wounded for our transgressions, and He bore the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of many, and He was delivered for our iniquities.&mdash; <em>From manuscript of writings of</em> <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a></span> .</p>

<h2>11</h2>

<p>When God formed man at the beginning, He suspended the things of nature on his will, and made an experiment by means of one commandment. For He ordained that, if he kept this, he should partake of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; but if he transgressed it, the contrary should be his lot. Man having been thus made, and immediately looking towards transgression, naturally became subject to corruption. Corruption then becoming inherent in nature, it was necessary that He who wished to save should be one who destroyed the efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of corruption. And this could not otherwise be done than by the life which is according to nature being united to that which had received the corruption, and so destroying the corruption, while preserving as <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> for the future that which had received it. It was therefore necessary that the Word should become possessed of a body, that He might deliver us from the death of natural corruption. For if, as you  say, He had simply by a nod warded off death from us, death indeed would not have approached us on account of the expression of His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; but none the less would we again have become corruptible, inasmuch as we carried about in ourselves that natural corruption.&mdash; Leontius <em>against Eutychians</em>, etc., book ii.</p>

<h2>12</h2>

<p>As it is inherent in all bodies formed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to have a shadow, so it is fitting that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is just, should render to those who choose what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and to those who prefer what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to every one according to his deserts.&mdash; <em>From the writings of</em> <span class="sc">John of Damascus</span> .</p>

<h2>13</h2>

<p>He speaks not of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in foreign lands, but concerning [the people] who agree with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, according to that which is spoken by Jeremiah: <q>It is a bitter thing for you, that you have forsaken me, says the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that of old you have broken your yoke, and torn asunder your bands, and said, I will not serve You, but will go to every high hill, and underneath every tree, and there shall I become dissolute in my fornication.</q> &mdash; <em>From manuscript of the writings of</em> <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a></span> .</p>

<h2>14</h2>

<p>Neither shall light ever be darkness as long as light exists, nor shall the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the things pertaining to us be controverted. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that than which nothing is more powerful. Every one who might speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and speaks it not, shall be judged by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.&mdash; <em>Manuscript and works of</em> <span class="sc">John of Damascus</span> .</p>

<h2>15</h2>

<p>And the fact that it was not said of the seventh day equally with the other days, <q>And there was evening, and there was morning,</q> is a distinct indication of the consummation which is to take place in it before it is finished, as the  fathers declare, especially St. Clement, and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">Justin</a> the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, who, commenting with exceeding wisdom on the number six of the sixth day, affirms that the intelligent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man and his five susceptible senses were the six works of the sixth day. Whence also, having discoursed at length on the number six, he declares that all things which have been framed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are divided into six classes&mdash;viz., into things intelligent and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, such as are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; into things reasonable and mortal, such as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>; into things sensitive and irrational, such as cattle, and birds, and fishes; into things that can advance, and move, and are insensible, such as the winds, and the clouds, and the waters, and the stars; into things which increase and are immoveable, such as the trees; and into things which are insensible and immoveable, such as the mountains, the earth, and such like. For all the creatures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in heaven and on earth, fall under one or other of these divisions, and are circumscribed by them.&mdash; <em>From the writings of</em> Anastasius.</p>

<h2>16</h2>

<p>Sound doctrine does not enter into the hard and disobedient heart; but, as if beaten back, enters anew into itself.</p>

<h2>17</h2>

<p>As the good of the body is health, so the good of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, which is indeed a kind of health of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by which a likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is attained.&mdash; <em>From the writings of</em> <span class="sc">John of Damascus</span> .</p>

<h2>18</h2>

<p>To yield and give way to our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> is the lowest slavery, even as to rule over them is the only liberty.</p>

<p>The greatest of all good is to be free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the next is to be justified; but he must be reckoned the most unfortunate of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who, while living unrighteously, remains for a long time unpunished.</p>

<p>Animals in harness cannot but be carried over a precipice by the inexperience and badness of their driver, even as by his skilfulness and excellence they will be saved.</p>

<p>The end contemplated by a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> is likeness to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so far as that is possible.&mdash; <em>From the writings of</em> <span class="sc">Antonius Melissa</span> .</p>

<h2>19</h2>

<p>[The words] of <a href="../cathen/08580c.htm">St. Justin</a>, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, from the fifth part of his <em>Apology:</em> &mdash; I reckon prosperity, O men, to consist in nothing else than in living according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But we do not live properly, or according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, unless we understand the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things.</p>

<p>It escapes them apparently, that he who has by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> come forth from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> himself, not, as they say, as being in a state of frenzy, but as free from the unstable and (as to every variety of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>) changeable corruption, by the simple and ever identical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.&mdash; <em>From the writings of</em> <span class="sc">John of Damascus</span> .</p>
