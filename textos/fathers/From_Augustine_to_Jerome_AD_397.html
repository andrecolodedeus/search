<h1>From Augustine to Jerome (A.D. 397)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Lord Much Beloved, and Brother Worthy of Being Honoured and Embraced with the Most Sincere Devotion of Charity, My Fellow-Presbyter Jerome, Augustine Sends Greeting.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. I thank you that, instead of a mere formal salutation, you wrote me a letter, though it was much shorter than I would desire to have from you; since nothing that comes from you is tedious, however much time it may demand. Wherefore, although I am beset with great anxieties about the affairs of others, and that, too, in regard to secular matters, I would find it difficult to pardon the brevity of your letter, were it not that I consider that it was written in reply to a yet shorter letter of my own. Address yourself, therefore, I entreat you, to that exchange of letters by which we may have fellowship, and may not permit the distance which separates us to keep us wholly apart from each other; though we are in the Lord bound together by the unity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, even when our pens rest and we are silent. The books in which you have laboured to bring treasures from the Lord's storehouse give me almost a complete <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of you. For if I may not say, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you,</q> because I have not seen your face, it may with equal <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be said that you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourself, for you cannot see your own face. If, however, it is this alone which constitutes your acquaintance with yourself, that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we also have no small <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it through your writings, in studying which we bless God that to yourself, to us, to all who read your works, He has given you as you are.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>2. It is not long since, among other things, a certain book of yours came into my hands, the name of which I do not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, for the manuscript itself had not the title written, as is customary, on the first page. The brother with whom it was found said that its title is <em>Epitaphium</em>&mdash;a name which we might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you to have approved, if we found in the work a notice of the lives or writings of those only who are deceased. Inasmuch, however, as mention is there made of the works of some who were at the time when it was written, or are even now, alive, we wonder why you either gave this title to it, or permitted others to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you had done so. The book itself has our complete approval as a useful work.</p> 

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>3. In your exposition of the Epistle of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Galatians I have found one thing which causes me much concern. For if it be the case that statements untrue in themselves, but made, as it were, out of a sense of duty in the interest of religion,  have been admitted into the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, what authority will be left to them? If this be conceded, what sentence can be produced from these Scriptures, by the weight of which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> obstinacy of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> can be broken down? For as soon as you have produced it, if it be disliked by him who contends with you, he will reply that, in the passage alleged, the writer was uttering a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> under the pressure of some <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> sense of duty. And where will any one find this way of escape impossible, if it be possible for men to say and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, after introducing his narrative with these words, <q>The things which I write unto you, behold, before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I lie not,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111606"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;1:20</a></span> the apostle lied when he said of Peter and Barnabas, <q>I saw that they walked not uprightly, according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the gospel </q>? <span class="stiki" id="note111607"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> For if they did walk uprightly, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wrote what was false; and if he wrote what was false <em>here</em>, when did he say what was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Shall he be supposed to say what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> when his teaching corresponds with the predilection of his reader, and shall everything which runs counter to the impressions of the reader be reckoned a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> uttered by him under a sense of duty? It will be impossible to prevent men from finding reasons for thinking that he not only might have uttered a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, but was bound to do so, if we admit this canon of interpretation. There is no need for many words in pursuing this argument, especially in writing to you, for whose wisdom and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> enough has already been said. I would by no means be so arrogant as to attempt to enrich by my small coppers  your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which by the divine gift is golden; and none is more able than yourself to revise and correct that work to which I have referred.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>4. You do not require me to teach you in what sense the apostle says, <q>To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> I became as a Jew, that I might gain the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111609"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:20</a></span> and other such things in the same passage, which are to be ascribed to the compassion of pitying <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, not the artifices of intentional deceit. For he that ministers to the sick becomes as if he were sick himself; not, indeed, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> pretending to be under the fever, but considering, with the mind of one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> sympathizing, what he would wish done for himself if he were in the sick man's place. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was indeed a Jew; and when he had become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, he had not abandoned those Jewish <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which that people had received in the right way, and for a certain appointed time. Therefore, even although he was an apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he took part in observing these; but with this view, that he might show that they were in no wise hurtful to those who, even after they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, desired to retain the ceremonies which by the law they had learned from their fathers; provided only that they did not build on these their hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which was foreshadowed in these has now been brought in by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. For the same reason, he judged that these ceremonies should by no means be made binding on the Gentile converts, because, by imposing a heavy and superfluous burden, they might turn aside from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> those who were unaccustomed to them.</p>

<p>5. The thing, therefore, which he rebuked in Peter was not his observing the customs handed down from his fathers&mdash; which Peter, if he wished, might do without being chargeable with deceit or inconsistency, for, though now superfluous, these customs were not hurtful to one who had been accustomed to them&mdash; but his compelling the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to observe Jewish ceremonies, <span class="stiki" id="note111610"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> which he could not do otherwise than by so acting in regard to them as if their observance was, even after the Lord's coming, still necessary to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, against which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> protested through the apostolic office of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Nor was the Apostle Peter <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this, but he did it through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of those who were of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. Manifestly, therefore, Peter was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> corrected, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has given a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> narrative of the event, unless, by the admission of a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> here, the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> given for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all coming generations is to be made wholly uncertain and wavering. For it is neither possible nor suitable to state within the compass of a letter how great and how unutterably <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> must be the consequences of such a concession. It might, however, be shown seasonably, and with less hazard, if we were conversing together.</p>

<p>6. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had forsaken everything peculiar to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, especially this: <q>That, being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they had not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111611"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3</a></span> In this, moreover, he differed from them: that after the passion and resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom had been given and made manifest the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, according to the order of <a href="../cathen/10156b.htm">Melchizedek</a>, they still considered it binding on them to celebrate, not out of mere reverence for old customs, but as necessary to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the old economy,  which were indeed at one time necessary, else had it been unprofitable and vain for the Maccabees to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, as they did, for their adherence to them. <span class="stiki" id="note111612"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;7:1</a></span> Lastly, in this also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> differed from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: that they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> preachers of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as enemies of the law. These and all similar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he declares that he <q>counted but loss and dung that he might win Christ;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111613"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;3:8</a></span> but he does not, in so saying, disparage the ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a>, if only they were observed after the custom of their fathers, in the way in which he himself observed them, without regarding them as necessary to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and not in the way in which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> affirmed that they must be observed, nor in the exercise of deceptive dissimulation such as he had rebuked in Peter. For if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> observed these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in order, by pretending to be a Jew, to gain the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, why did he not also take part with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, when to them that were without law he became as without law, that he might gain them also? The explanation is found in this, that he took part in the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, as being himself by birth a Jew; and that when he said all this which I have quoted, he meant, not that he pretended to be what he was not, but that he felt with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> compassion that he must bring such help to them as would be needful for himself if he were involved in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Herein he exercised not the subtlety of a deceiver, but the sympathy of a compassionate deliverer. In the same passage the apostle has stated the principle more generally: <q>To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I am made all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that I might by all means save some,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111614"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:22</a></span> &mdash; the latter clause of which guides us to understand the former as meaning that he showed himself one who pitied the weakness of another as much as if it had been his own. For when he said, <q>Who is weak, and I am not weak?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111615"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> he did not wish it to be supposed that he pretended to suffer the infirmity of another, but rather that he showed it by sympathy.</p>

<p>7. Wherefore I beseech you, apply to the correction and emendation of that book a frank and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> severity, and chant what the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;&#x1FF4;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> . For incomparably more lovely than the Grecian Helen is <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: In her defence, our <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> have fought against <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> with more <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> than the heroes of Greece displayed against Troy for Helen's sake. I do not say this in order that you may recover the faculty of spiritual sight, &mdash; far be it from me to say that you have lost it!&mdash; but that, having eyes both clear and quick in discernment, you may turn them towards that from which, in unaccountable dissimulation, you have turned them away, refusing to see the calamitous consequences which would follow on our once admitting that a writer of the divine books could in any part of his work honourably and piously utter a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>8. I had written some time ago a letter to you on this subject,  which was not delivered to you, because the bearer to whom it was entrusted did not finish his journey to you. From it I may quote a thought which occurred to me while I was dictating it, and which I ought not to omit in this letter, in order that, if your opinion is still different from mine, and is better, you may readily forgive the anxiety which has moved me to write. It is this: If your opinion is different, and is according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> (for only in that case can it be better than mine), you will grant that <q>a mistake of mine, which is in the interest of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, cannot deserve great blame, if indeed it deserves blame at all, when it is possible for you to use <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the interest of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> without doing wrong.</q> </p>

<p>9. As to the reply which you were pleased to give me concerning <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, I did not need to be told that we should, not only in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers, but in all others, approve and commend what we find right and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but reject and condemn what we find false and mischievous. What I craved from your wisdom and learning (and I still crave it), was that you should acquaint us definitely with the points in which that remarkable man is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have departed from the belief of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Moreover, in that book in which you have mentioned all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> writers whom you could remember, and their works, it would, I think, be a more convenient arrangement if, after naming those whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (since you have chosen not to pass them without notice), you would add in what respect their doctrine is to be avoided. Some of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also you have omitted, and I would fain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> on what grounds. If, however, perchance it has been from a desire not to enlarge that volume unduly that you refrained from adding to a notice of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the statement of the things in which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has authoritatively condemned them, I beg you not to grudge bestowing on this subject, to which with humility and brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> I direct your attention, a portion of that literary labour by which already, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have in no small measure stimulated and assisted the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the study of the Latin tongue, and publish in one small book (if your other occupations permit you) a digest of the perverse <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who up to this time have, through arrogance, or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or self-will, attempted to subvert the simplicity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; a work most necessary for the information of those who are prevented, either by lack of leisure or by their not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the Greek language, from reading and understanding so many things. I would urge my request at greater length, were it not that this is commonly a sign of misgivings as to the benevolence of the party from whom a favour is sought. Meanwhile I cordially recommend to your goodwill in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our brother Paulus, to whose high standing in these regions I bear before God willing testimony.</p>
