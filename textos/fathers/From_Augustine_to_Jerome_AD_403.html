<h1>From Augustine to Jerome (A.D. 403)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Venerable Lord Jerome, My Esteemed and Holy Brother and Fellow-Presbyter, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. Never since I began to write to you, and to long for your writing in return, have I met with a better opportunity for our exchanging communications than now, when my letter is to be carried to you by a most faithful servant and minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is also a very dear friend of mine, namely, our son Cyprian, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. Through him I expect to receive a letter from you with all the certainty which is in a matter of this kind possible. For the son whom I have named will not be found wanting in respect of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in asking, or persuasive influence in obtaining a reply from you; nor will he fail in diligently keeping, promptly bearing, and faithfully delivering the same. I only <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that if I be in any way worthy of this, the Lord may give His help and favour to your heart and to my desire, so that no higher will may hinder that which your brotherly goodwill inclines you to do.</p>

<p>2. As I have sent you two letters already to which I have received no reply, I have resolved to send you at this time copies of both of them, for I suppose that they never reached you. If they did reach you, and your replies have failed, as may be the case, to reach me, send me a second time the same as you sent before, if you have copies of them preserved: if you have not, dictate again what I may read, and do not refuse to send to these former letters the answer for which I have been waiting so long. My first letter to you, which I had prepared while I was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, was to be delivered to you by a brother of ours, Profuturus, who afterwards became my colleague in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, and has since then departed from this life; but he could not then bear it to you in person, because at the very time when he intended to begin his journey, he was prevented by his ordination to the weighty office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and shortly afterwards he died. This letter I have resolved also to send at this time, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how long I have cherished a burning desire for conversation with you, and with what reluctance I submit to the remote separation which prevents my mind from having access to yours through our bodily senses, my brother, most amiable and honoured among the members of the Lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>3. In this letter I have further to say, that I have since heard that you have translated Job out of the original Hebrew, although in your own translation of the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> from the Greek tongue we had already a version of that book. In that earlier version you marked with asterisks the words found in the Hebrew but wanting in the Greek, and with obelisks the words found in the Greek but wanting in the Hebrew; and this was done with such astonishing exactness, that in some places we have every word distinguished by a separate asterisk, as a sign that these words are in the Hebrew, but not in the Greek. Now, however, in this more recent version from the Hebrew, there is not the same scrupulous fidelity as to the words; and it perplexes any thoughtful reader to understand either what was the reason for marking the asterisks in the former version with so much care that they indicate the absence from the Greek version of even the smallest grammatical particles which have not been rendered from the Hebrew, or what is the reason for so much less care having been taken in this recent version from the Hebrew to secure that these same particles be found in their own places. I would have put down here an extract or two in illustration of this criticism; but at present I have not access to the manuscript of the translation from the Hebrew. Since, however, your quick discernment anticipates and goes beyond not only what I have said, but also what I meant to say, you already understand, I think, enough to be able, by giving the reason for the plan which you have adopted, to explain what perplexes me.</p>

<p>4. For my part, I would much rather that you would furnish us with a translation of the Greek version of the canonical Scriptures <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the work of the Seventy translators. For if your translation begins to be more generally read in many churches, it will be a grievous thing that, in the reading of Scripture, differences must arise between the Latin Churches and the Greek Churches, especially seeing that the discrepancy is easily condemned in a Latin version by the production of the original in Greek, which is a language very widely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; whereas, if any one has been disturbed by the occurrence of something to which he was not accustomed in the translation taken from the Hebrew, and alleges that the new translation is wrong, it will be found difficult, if not impossible, to get at the Hebrew documents by which the version to which exception is taken may be defended. And when they are obtained, who will submit to have so many Latin and Greek authorities pronounced to be in the wrong? Besides all this, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, if consulted as to the meaning of the Hebrew text, may give a different opinion from yours: in which case it will seem as if your presence were indispensable, as being the only one who could refute their view; and it would be a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> if one could be found capable of acting as arbiter between you and them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>5. A certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, one of our brethren, having introduced in the church over which he presides the reading of your version, came upon a word in the book of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jonah, of which you have given a very different rendering from that which had been of old familiar to the senses and memory of all the worshippers, and had been chanted for so many generations in the church. <span class="stiki" id="note111886"><a href="../bible/jon004.htm#verse6">Jonah&nbsp;4:6</a></span> Thereupon arose such a tumult in the congregation, especially among the Greeks, correcting what had been read, and denouncing the translation as false, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was compelled to ask the testimony of the Jewish residents (it was in the town of Oea). These, whether from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or from spite, answered that the words in the Hebrew manuscripts were correctly rendered in the Greek version, and in the Latin one taken from it. What further need I say? The man was compelled to correct your version in that passage as if it had been <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> translated, as he desired not to be left without a congregation&mdash;a calamity which he narrowly escaped. From this case we also are led to think that you may be occasionally mistaken. You will also observe how great must have been the difficulty if this had occurred in those writings which cannot be explained by comparing the testimony of languages now in use.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>6. At the same time, we are in no small measure thankful to God for the work in which you have translated the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> from the original Greek, because in almost every passage we have found nothing to object to, when we compared it with the Greek Scriptures. By this work, any disputant who supports an old false translation is either convinced or confuted with the utmost ease by the production and collation of manuscripts. And if, as indeed very rarely happens, something be found to which exception may be taken, who would be so unreasonable as not to excuse it readily in a work so useful that it cannot be too highly praised? I wish you would have the kindness to open up to me what you think to be the reason of the frequent discrepancies between the text supported by the Hebrew codices and the Greek <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> version. For the latter has no mean authority, seeing that it has obtained so wide circulation, and was the one which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> used, as is not only <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by looking to the text itself, but has also been, as I remember, affirmed by yourself. You would therefore confer upon us a much greater boon if you gave an exact Latin translation of the Greek <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> version: for the variations found in the different codices of the Latin text are intolerably numerous; and it is so <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> open to suspicion as possibly different from what is to be found in the Greek, that one has no confidence in either quoting it or proving anything by its help.</p>

<p>I thought that this letter was to be a short one, but it has somehow been as pleasant to me to go on with it as if I were talking with you. I conclude with entreating you by the Lord kindly to send me a full reply, and thus give me, so far as is in your power, the pleasure of your presence.</p>
