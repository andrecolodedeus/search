<h1>From Augustine to Jerome (A.D. 404)</h1>

<p> <em>To Jerome, My Venerable and Most Esteemed Brother and Fellow-Presbyter Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. Although I suppose that, before this reaches you, you have received through our son the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Cyprian, a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the letter which I sent by him, from which you would be apprised with certainty that I wrote the letter of which you mentioned that a copy had been brought to you; in consequence of which I suppose that I have begun already, like the rash Dares, to be beaten and belaboured by the missiles and the merciless fists of a second Entellus  in the reply which you have written; nevertheless I answer in the meantime the letter which you have deigned to send me by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> son Asterius, in which I have found many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of your most kind goodwill to me, and at the same time some signs of your having in some measure felt agrieved by me. In reading it, therefore, I was no sooner soothed by one sentence than I was buffeted in another; my wonder being especially called forth by this, that after alleging, as your reason for not rashly accepting as authentic the letter from me of which you had a copy, the fact that, offended by your reply, I might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> remonstrate with you, because you ought first to have ascertained that it was mine before answering it, you go on to command me to acknowledge the letter frankly if it is mine, or send a more reliable copy of it, in order that we may, without any bitterness of feeling, address ourselves to the discussion of scriptural doctrine. For how can we engage in such discussion without bitterness of feeling, if you have made up your mind to offend me? Or, if your mind is not made up to this, what reason could I have had, when you did not offend me, for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> complaining as having been offended by you, that you ought first to have made sure that the letter was mine, and only then to have replied, that is to say, only then to have offended me? For if there had been nothing to offend me in your reply, I could have had no just ground of complaint.  Accordingly, when you write such a reply to that letter as must offend me, what hope is left of our engaging without any bitterness in the discussion of scriptural doctrine? Far be it from me to take offense if you are willing and able to prove, by incontrovertible argument, that you have apprehended more correctly than I have the meaning of that passage in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> Epistle [to the Galatians], or of any other text in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>: nay, more, far be it from me to count it anything else than gain to myself, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of thankfulness to you, if in anything I am either informed by your teaching or set right by your correction.</p>

<p>2. But, my very dear brother, you could not think that I could be offended by your reply, had you not thought that you were offended by what I had written. For I could never have entertained concerning you the idea that you had not felt yourself offended by me if you so framed your reply as to offend me in return. If, on the other hand, I have been supposed by you to be capable of such preposterous folly as to take offense when you had not written in such a way as to give me occasion, you have in this already wronged me, that you have entertained such an opinion of me. But surely you who are so cautious, that although you recognised my style in the letter of which you had a copy, you refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> its authenticity, would not without consideration <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me to be so different from what your experience has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> me to be. For if you had good reason for seeing that I might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> complain had you hastily concluded that a letter not written by me was mine, how much more reasonably may I complain if you form, without consideration, such an estimate of myself as is contradicted by your own experience! You would not therefore go so far astray in your judgment as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, when you had written nothing by which I could be offended, that I would nevertheless be so foolish as to be capable of being offended by such a reply.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>3. There can therefore be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that you were prepared to reply in such a way as would offend me, if you had only indisputable evidence that the letter was mine. Accordingly, since I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you would think it right to offend me unless you had just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, it remains for me to confess, as I now do, my fault as having been the first to offend by writing that letter which I cannot deny to be mine. Why should I strive to swim against the current, and not rather ask pardon? I therefore entreat you by the mercy of Christ to forgive me wherein I have injured you, and not to render <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by injuring me in return. For it will be an injury to me if you pass over in silence anything which you find wrong in either word or action of mine. If, indeed, you rebuke in me that which merits no rebuke, you do wrong to yourself, not to me; for far be it from one of your life and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vows to rebuke merely from a desire to give offense, using the tongue of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> to condemn in me that which by the truth-revealing light of reason you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to deserve no blame. Therefore either rebuke kindly him whom, though he is free from fault, you think to merit rebuke; or with a father's kindness soothe him whom you cannot bring to agree with you. For it is possible that your opinion may be at variance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, while notwithstanding your actions are in harmony with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity: for I also shall most thankfully receive your rebuke as a most friendly action, even though the thing censured be capable of defence, and therefore ought not to have been censured; or else I shall acknowledge both your kindness and my fault, and shall be found, so far as the Lord enables me, grateful for the one, and corrected in regard to the other.</p>

<p>4. Why, then, shall I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> your words, hard, perhaps, like the boxing-gloves of Entellus, but certainly fitted to do me good? The blows of Entellus were intended not to heal, but to harm, and therefore his antagonist was conquered, not cured. But I, if I receive your correction calmly as a necessary medicine, shall not be pained by it. If, however, through weakness, either common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> or peculiar to myself, I cannot help feeling some pain from rebuke, even when I am <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> reproved, it is far better to have a tumour in one's head cured, though the lance <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> pain, than to escape the pain by letting the disease go on. This was clearly seen by him who said that, for the most part, our enemies who expose our faults are more useful than friends who are afraid to reprove us. For the former, in their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> recriminations, sometimes charge us with what we indeed require to correct; but the latter, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of destroying the sweetness of friendship, show less boldness on behalf of right than they ought. Since, therefore, you are, to quote your own comparison, an ox  worn out, perhaps, as to your bodily strength by reason of years, but unimpaired in mental vigour, and toiling still assiduously and with profit in the Lord's threshing-floor; here am I, and in whatever I have spoken amiss, tread firmly on me: the weight of your venerable age should not be grievous to me, if the chaff of my fault be so bruised under foot as to be separated from me.</p>

<p>5. Let me further say, that it is with the utmost affectionate yearning that I read or recollect the words at the end of your letter, <q>Would that I could receive your embrace, and that by converse we might aid each other in learning.</q> For my part, I say&mdash;Would that we were even dwelling in parts of the earth less widely separated; so that if we could not meet for converse, we might at least have a more frequent exchange of letters. For as it is, so great is the distance by which we are prevented from any kind of access to each other through the eye and ear, that I remember writing to your Holiness regarding these words in the Epistle to the Galatians when I was young; and behold I am now advanced in age, and have not yet received a reply, and a copy of my letter has reached you by some strange accident earlier than the letter itself, about the transmission of which I took no small pains. For the man to whom I entrusted it neither delivered it to you nor returned it to me. So great in my esteem is the value of those of your writings which we have been able to procure, that I should prefer to all other studies the privilege, if it were attainable by me, of sitting by your side and learning from you. Since I cannot do this myself, I propose to send to you one of my sons in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, that he may for my benefit be instructed by you, in the event of my receiving from you a favourable reply in regard to the matter. For I have not now, and I can never hope to have, such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> as I see you possess. Whatever abilities I may have for such study, I devote entirely to the instruction of the people whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has entrusted to me; and I am wholly precluded by my <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> occupations from having leisure for any further prosecution of my studies than is necessary for my duty in public teaching.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>6. I am not acquainted with the writings speaking injuriously of you, which you tell me have come into Africa. I have, however, received the reply to these which you have been pleased to send. After reading it, let me say frankly, I have been exceedingly grieved that the mischief of such painful discord has arisen between <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> once so loving and intimate, and formerly united by the bond of a friendship which was well known in almost all the Churches. In that treatise of yours, any one may see how you are keeping yourself under restraint, and holding back the stinging keenness of your indignation, lest you should render railing for railing. If, however, even in reading this reply of yours, I fainted with grief and shuddered with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, what would be the effect produced in me by the things which he has written against you, if they should come into my possession! <q>Woe unto the world because of offenses!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111892"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;18:7</a></span> Behold the complete fulfilment of which He who is Truth foretold: <q>Because iniquity shall abound, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many shall wax cold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111893"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12</a></span> For what trusting hearts can now pour themselves forth with any assurance of their confidence being reciprocated? Into whose breast may confiding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> now throw itself without reserve? In short, where is the friend who may not be feared as possibly a future enemy, if the breach that we deplore could arise between Jerome and Rufinus? Oh, sad and pitiable is our portion! Who can rely upon the affection of his friends because of what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them to be now, when he has no foreknowledge of what they shall afterwards become? But why should I reckon it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for sorrow, that one man is thus <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what another may become, when no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> even what he himself is afterwards to be? The utmost that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> but imperfectly, is his present condition; of what he shall hereafter become he has no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>7. Do the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> possess not only this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their actual character, but also a foreknowledge of what they shall afterward become? If they do, I cannot see how it was possible for <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> ever to have been <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, even while he was still a good <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, as in this case he must have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, his future transgression and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. I would wish to hear what you think as to this question, if indeed it be one which it would be profitable for us to be able to answer. But mark here what I suffer from the lands and seas which keep us, so far as the body is concerned, distant from each other. If I were myself the letter which you are now reading, you might have told me already what I have just asked; but now, when will you write me a reply? When will you get it sent away? When will it come here? When shall I receive it? And yet, would that I were sure that it would come at last, though meanwhile I must summon all the patience which I can command to endure the unwelcome but unavoidable delay! Wherefore I come back to those most delightful words of your letter, filled with your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> longing, and I in turn appropriate them as my own: <q>Would that I might receive your embrace, and that by converse we might aid each other in learning,</q>&mdash; if indeed there be any sense in which I could possibly impart instruction to you.</p>

<p>8. When by these words, now mine not less than yours, I am gladdened and refreshed, and when I am comforted not a little by the fact that in both of us a desire for mutual fellowship exists, though meanwhile unsatisfied, it is not long before I am pierced through by darts of keenest sorrow when I consider Rufinus and you, to whom God had granted in fullest measure and for a length of time that which both of us have longed for, so that in most close and endearing fellowship you feasted together on the honey of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, and think how between you the blight of such exceeding bitterness  has found its way, constraining us to ask when, where, and in whom the same calamity may not be reasonably feared; seeing that it has befallen you at the very time when, unencumbered, having cast away secular burdens, you were following the Lord and were living together in that very land which was trodden by the feet of our Lord, when He said, <q>Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111894"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;14:27</a></span> being, moreover, men of mature age, whose life was devoted to the study of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Truly <q>man's life on earth is a period of trial.</q>  If I could anywhere meet you both together&mdash; which, alas, I cannot hope to do&mdash; so strong are my agitation, grief, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, that I think I would cast myself at your feet, and there weeping till I could weep no more, would, with all the eloquence of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, appeal first to each of you for his own sake, then to both for each other's sake, and for the sake of those, especially the weak, <q>for whom Christ died,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111896"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:11</a></span> whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is in peril, as they look on you who occupy a place so conspicuous on the stage of time; imploring you not to write and scatter abroad these hard words against each other, which, if at any time you who are now at variance were reconciled, you could not destroy, and which you could not then venture to read lest strife should be kindled anew.</p>

<p>9. But I say to your Charity, that nothing has made me tremble more than your estrangement from Rufinus, when I read in your letter some of the indications of your being displeased with me. I refer not so much to what you say of Entellus and of the wearied ox, in which you appear to me to use genial pleasantry rather than <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> threat, but to that which you have evidently written in earnest, of which I have already spoken perhaps more than was fitting, but not more than my fears compelled me to do&mdash;namely, the words, <q>lest perchance, being offended, you should have reason to remonstrate with me.</q> If it be possible for us to examine and discuss anything by which our hearts may be nourished, without any bitterness of discord I entreat you let us address ourselves to this. But if it is not possible for either of us to point out what he may judge to demand correction in the other's writings, without being suspected of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and regarded as wounding friendship, let us, having regard to our spiritual life and health, leave such conference alone. Let us content ourselves with smaller attainments in that [<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>] which puffs up, if we can thereby preserve unharmed that [charity] which edifies. <span class="stiki" id="note111897"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:1</a></span> I feel that I come far short of that perfection of which it is written, <q>If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111898"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James&nbsp;3:2</a></span> but through God's mercy I <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> myself able to ask your forgiveness for that in which I have offended you: and this you ought to make plain to me, that through my hearing you, you may gain your brother. <span class="stiki" id="note111899"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;18:18</a></span> Nor should you make it a reason for leaving me in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, that the distance between us on the earth's surface makes it impossible for us to meet face to face. As concerns the subjects into which we inquire, if I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, or think that I have got hold of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a matter in which your opinion is different from mine, I shall by all means endeavour, as the Lord may enable me, to maintain my view without injuring you. And as to any offense which I may give to you, so soon as I perceive your displeasure, I shall unreservedly beg your forgiveness.</p>

<p>10. I think, moreover, that your reason for being displeased with me can only be, that I have either said what I ought not, or have not expressed myself in the manner in which I ought: for I do not wonder that we are less thoroughly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to each other than we are to our most close and intimate friends. Upon the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of such friends I readily cast myself without reservation, especially when chafed and wearied by the scandals of this world; and in their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> I rest without any disturbing care: for I perceive that God is there, on whom I confidingly cast myself, and in whom I confidingly rest. Nor in this confidence am I disturbed by any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of that uncertainty as to the morrow which must be present when we lean upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, and which I have in a former paragraph bewailed. For when I perceive that a man is burning with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and feel that thereby he has been made a faithful friend to me, whatever plans or thoughts of mine I entrust to him I regard as entrusted not to the man, but to Him in whom his character makes it evident that he dwells: for <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and he that dwells in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> dwells in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God in him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111900"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:16</a></span> and if he cease to dwell in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, his forsaking it cannot but <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as much pain as his abiding in it caused <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Nevertheless, in such a case, when one who was an intimate friend has become an enemy, it is better that he should search out what ingenuity may help him to fabricate to our prejudice, than that he should find what <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> may provoke him to reveal. This every one most easily secures, not by concealing what he does, but by doing nothing which he would wish to conceal. And this the mercy of God grants to good and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men: they go out and in among their friends in liberty and without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, whatever these friends may afterwards become: the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which may have been committed by others within their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they do not reveal, and they themselves avoid doing what they would <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to see revealed. For when any false charge is fabricated by a slanderer, either it is disbelieved, or, if it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, our <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> alone is injured, our spiritual wellbeing is not affected. But when, any sinful action is committed, that action becomes a secret enemy, even though it be not revealed by the thoughtless or malicious talk of one acquainted with our secrets. Wherefore any person of discernment may see in your own example how, by the comfort of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, you bear what would otherwise be insupportable&mdash; the incredible enmity of one who was formerly your most intimate and beloved friend; and how even what he utters against you, even what may to your disadvantage be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by some, you turn to good account as the armour of righteousness on the left hand, which is not less useful than armour on the right hand <span class="stiki" id="note111901"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:7</a></span> in our warfare with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> I would rather see him less bitter in his accusations, than see you thus more fully armed by them. This is a great and a lamentable wonder, that you should have passed from such amity to such enmity: it would be a joyful and a much greater event, should you come back from such enmity to the friendship of former days.</p>
