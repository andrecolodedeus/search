<h1>From Augustine to Jerome, on the origin of the soul (A.D. 415)</h1>

<p> <em>A Treatise on the Origin of the Human Soul, Addressed to Jerome.</em> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. Unto our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has called us unto His kingdom and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note112714"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:12</a></span> I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> now, that what I write to you, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother Jerome, asking your opinion in regard to things of which I am <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, may by His good pleasure be profitable to us both. For although in addressing you I consult one much older than myself, nevertheless I also am becoming old; but I cannot think that it is at anytime of life too late to learn what we need to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, because, although it is more fitting that old men should be teachers than learners, it is nevertheless more fitting for them to learn than to continue <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of that which they should teach to others. I assure you that, amid the many disadvantages which I have to submit to in studying very difficult questions, there is none which grieves me more than the circumstance of separation from your Charity by a distance so great that I can scarcely send a letter to you, and scarcely receive one from you, even at intervals, not of days nor of months, but of several years; whereas my desire would be, if it were possible, to have you daily beside me, as one with whom I could converse on any theme. Nevertheless, although I have not been able to do all that I wished, I am not the less bound to do all that I can.</p>

<p>2. Behold, a religious young man has come to me, by name <a href="../cathen/11322a.htm">Orosius</a>, who is in the bond of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peace a brother, in point of age a son, and in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> a fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of quick understanding, ready speech, and burning <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, desiring to be in the Lord's house a vessel rendering useful service in refuting those false and pernicious doctrines, through which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> have suffered much more grievous wounds than have been inflicted on their bodies by the sword of barbarians. For from the remote western coast of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> he has come with eager haste to us, having been prompted to do this by the report that from me he could learn whatever he wished on the subjects on which he desired information. Nor has his coming been altogether in vain. In the first place, he has learned not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all that report affirmed of me: in the next place, I have taught him all that I could, and, as for the things in which I could not teach him, I have told him from whom he may learn them, and have exhorted him to go on to you. As he received this counsel or rather injunction of mine with pleasure, and with intention to comply with it, I asked him to visit us on his way home to his own country when he comes from you. On receiving his promise to this effect, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the Lord had granted me an opportunity of writing to you regarding certain things which I wish through you to learn. For I was seeking some one whom I might send to you, and it was not easy to fall in with one qualified both by trustworthiness in performing and by alacrity in undertaking the work, as well as by experience in travelling. Therefore, when I became acquainted with this young man, I could not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he was exactly such a person as I was asking from the Lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>3. Allow me, therefore, to bring before you a subject which I beseech you not to refuse to open up and discuss with me. Many are perplexed by questions concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and I confess that I myself am of this number. I shall in this letter, in the first place, state explicitly the things regarding the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which I most assuredly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and shall, in the next place, bring forward the things regarding which I am still desirous of explanation.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man is in a sense proper to itself <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. It is not absolutely <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, as God is, of whom it is written that He <q>alone has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112715"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> for <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> makes mention of deaths to which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is liable&mdash; as in the saying, <q>Let the dead bury their dead;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112716"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;8:22</a></span> but because when alienated from the life of God it so dies as not wholly to cease from living in its own nature, it is found to be from a certain <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> mortal, yet so as to be not without reason called at the same time <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if it were, it would be absolutely immutable and incorruptible, in which case it could neither go downward to be worse, nor go onward to be better; nor could it either begin to have anything in itself which it had not before, or cease to have anything  which it had within the sphere of its own experience. But how different the actual facts of the case are is a point requiring no evidence from without, it is acknowledged by every one who consults his own consciousness. In vain, moreover, is it pleaded by those who affirm that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the corruption and baseness which we see in the worst of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the weakness and blemishes which we see in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, come to it not from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself, but from the body; for what matters it whence the infirmity originates in that which, if it were indeed immutable, could not, from any quarter whatever, be made infirm? For that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> immutable and incorruptible is not liable to mutation or corruption by any influence whatever from without, else the invulnerability which the fable ascribed to the flesh of Achilles would be nothing peculiar to him, but the property of every man, so long as no accident befell him. That which is liable to be changed in any manner, by any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, or in any part whatever, is therefore not by nature immutable; but it were impiety to think of God as otherwise than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and supremely immutable: therefore the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not a part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>4. That the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is immaterial is a fact of which I avow myself to be fully persuaded, although men of slow understanding are hard to be convinced that it is so. To secure myself, however, from either unnecessarily causing to others or unreasonably bringing upon myself a controversy about an expression, let me say that, since the thing itself is beyond question, it is needless to contend about mere terms. If matter be used as a term denoting everything which in any form has a separate <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, whether it be called an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, or a substance, or by another name, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is material. Again, if you choose to apply the epithet immaterial only to that nature which is supremely immutable and is everywhere present in its entirety, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is material, for it is not at all endowed with such qualities. But if matter be used to designate nothing but that which, whether at rest or in motion, has some length, breadth, and height, so that with a greater part of itself it occupies a greater part of space, and with a smaller part a smaller space, and is in every part of it less than the whole, then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not material. For it pervades the whole body which it animates, not by a local distribution of parts, but by a certain vital influence, being at the same moment present in its entirety in all parts of the body, and not less in smaller parts and greater in larger parts, but here with more energy and there with less energy, it is in its entirety present both in the whole body and in every part of it. For even that which the mind perceives in only a part of the body is nevertheless not otherwise perceived than by the whole mind; for when any part of the living flesh is touched by a fine pointed instrument, although the place affected is not only not the whole body, but scarcely discernible in its surface, the contact does not escape the entire <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and yet the contact is felt not over the whole body, but only at the one point where it takes place. How comes it, then, that what takes place in only a part of the body is immediately <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the whole <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, unless the whole mind is present at that part, and at the same time not deserting all the other parts of the body in order to be present in its entirety at this one? For all the other parts of the body in which no such contact takes place are still living by the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> being present with them. And if a similar contact takes place in the other parts, and the contact occur in both parts simultaneously, it would in both cases alike be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> at the same moment, to the whole mind. Now this presence of the mind in all parts of the body at the same moment, so that in every part of the body the whole mind is at the same moment present, would be impossible if it were distributed over these parts in the same way as we see matter distributed in space, occupying less space with a smaller portion of itself, and greater space with a greater portion. If, therefore, mind is to be called material, it is not material in the same sense as earth, water, air, and ether are material. For all things composed of these elements are larger in larger places, or smaller in smaller places, and none of them is in its entirety present at any part of itself, but the dimensions of the material substances are according to the dimensions of the space occupied. Whence it is perceived that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whether it be termed material or immaterial, has a certain nature of its own, created from a substance superior to the elements of this world&mdash;a substance which cannot be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> conceived of by any representation of the material images perceived by the bodily senses, but which is apprehended by the understanding and discovered to our consciousness by its living energy. These things I am stating, not with the view of teaching you what you already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but in order that I may declare explicitly what I hold as indisputably certain concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, lest any one should think, when I come to state the questions to which I desire answers, that I hold none of the doctrines which we have learned from science or from revelation concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>5. I am, moreover, fully persuaded that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has fallen into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not through the fault of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor through any necessity either in the divine nature or in its own, but by its own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>; and that it can be delivered from the body of this death neither by the strength of its own will, as if that were in itself sufficient to achieve this, nor by the death of the body itself, but only by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note112717"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24-25</a></span> and that there is not one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> the one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, is not absolutely necessary. Every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, moreover, which may at any age whatsoever depart from this life without the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Mediator and the sacrament of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, departs to future punishment, and shall receive again its own body at the last judgment as a partner in punishment. But if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after its natural generation, which was derived from Adam, be regenerated in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it belongs to His fellowship,  and shall not only have rest after the death of the body, but also receive again its own body as a partner in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. These are truths concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which I hold most firmly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>6. Permit me now, therefore, to bring before you the question which I desire to have solved, and do not reject me; so may He not reject you who condescended to be rejected for our sakes!</p>

<p>I ask where can the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even of an infant snatched away by death, have contracted the guilt which, unless the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ has come to the rescue by that sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is administered even to infants, involves it in condemnation? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you are not one of those who have begun of late to utter certain new and absurd opinions, alleging that there is no guilt derived from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> which is removed by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the case of infants. If I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that you held this view, or, rather, if I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you reject it, I would certainly neither address this question to you, nor think that it ought to be put to you at all. Since, however, we hold on this subject the opinion consonant with the immoveable <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which you have yourself expressed when, refuting the absurd sayings of Jovinian, you have quoted this sentence from the book of Job: <q>In your sight, no one is clean, not even the infant, whose time of life on earth is a single day,</q>  adding, <q>for we are held guilty in the similitude of Adam's transgression,</q> &mdash; an opinion which your book on Jonah's <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> declares in a notable and lucid manner, where you affirm that the little children of Nineveh were <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> compelled to fast along with the people, because merely of their original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, &mdash; it is not unsuitable that I should address to you the question&mdash; where has the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> contracted the guilt from which, even at that age, it must be delivered by the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?</p>

<p>7. Some years ago, when I wrote certain books concerning <em>Free Will</em>, which have gone forth into the hands of many, and are now in the possession of very many readers, after referring to these four opinions as to the manner of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>&mdash;(1) that all other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are derived from the one which was given to the first man; (2) that for each individual a new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is made; (3) that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> already in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> somewhere are sent by divine act into the bodies; or (4) glide into them of their own accord, I thought that it was necessary to treat them in such a way that, whichever of them might be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the decision should not hinder the object which I had in view when contending with all my might against those who attempt to lay upon God the blame of a nature endowed with its own principle of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, namely, the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>;  for at that time I had not heard of the Priscillianists, who utter <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> not very dissimilar to these. As to the fifth opinion, namely, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;an opinion which, in order to omit none, you have mentioned along with the rest in your letter to Marcellinus (a man of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory and very dear to us in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ), who had consulted you on this question, &mdash; I did not add it to the others for two reasons, first&mdash;because, in examining this opinion, we discuss not the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but its nature; secondly, because this is the view held by those against whom I was arguing, and the main design of my argument was to prove that the blameless and inviolable nature of the Creator has nothing to do with the faults and blemishes of the creature, while they, on their part, maintained that the substance of the good God itself is, in so far as it is led captive, corrupted and oppressed and brought under a necessity of sinning by the substance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to which they ascribe a proper dominion and principalities. Leaving, therefore, out of the question this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, I desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which of the other four opinions we ought to choose. For whichever of them may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> claim our preference, far be it from us to assail this article of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, about which we have no uncertainty, that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of an infant, requires to be delivered from the binding guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that there is no deliverance except through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and Him crucified.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>8. To avoid prolixity, therefore, let me refer to the opinion which you, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, entertain, viz. that God even now makes each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for each individual at the time of birth. To meet the objection to this view which might be taken from the fact that God finished the whole work of creation on the sixth day and rested on the seventh day, you quote the testimony of the words in the gospel, <q>My Father works hitherto, and I work.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112724"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;5:17</a></span> This you have written in your letter to Marcellinus, in which letter, moreover, you have most kindly condescended to mention my name, saying that he had me here in Africa, who could more easily explain to him the opinion held by you.  But had I been able to do this, he would not have applied for instruction to you, who were so remote from him, though perhaps he did not write from Africa to you. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not when he wrote it; I only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> well my hesitation to embrace any definite view on this subject, for which reason he preferred to write to you without consulting me. Yet, even if he had consulted me, I would rather have encouraged him to write to you, and would have expressed my gratitude for the benefit which might have been conferred on us all, had you not preferred to send a brief note, instead of a full reply, doing this, I suppose, to save yourself from unnecessary expenditure of effort in a place where I, whom you supposed to be thoroughly acquainted with the subject of his inquiries, was at hand. Behold, I am willing that the opinion which you hold should be also mine; but I assure you that as yet I have not embraced it.</p>

<p>9. You have sent to me scholars, to whom you wish me to impart what I have not yet learned myself. Teach me, therefore, what I am to teach them; for many urge me vehemently to be a teacher on this subject, and to them I confess that of this, as well as of many other things, I am <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and perhaps, though they maintain a respectful demeanour in my presence, they say among themselves: <q>Are you a master in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> not these things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112726"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;3:10</a></span> a rebuke which the Lord gave to one who belonged to the class of men who delighted in being called Rabbi; which was also the reason of his coming by night to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Teacher, because perchance he, who had been accustomed to teach, blushed to take the learner's place. But, for my own part, it gives me much more pleasure to hear instruction from another, than to be myself listened to as a teacher. For I remember what He said to those whom, above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, He had chosen: <q>But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your master, even Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112727"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;23:8</a></span> Nor was it any other teacher who taught <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by Jethro, <span class="stiki" id="note112728"><a href="../bible/exo018.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;18:14-25</a></span> Cornelius by Peter the earlier apostle, <span class="stiki" id="note112729"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse25">Acts&nbsp;10:25-48</a></span> and Peter himself by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the later apostle; <span class="stiki" id="note112730"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse11">Galatians&nbsp;2:11-21</a></span> for by whomsoever <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is spoken, it is spoken by the gift of Him who is the Truth. What if the reason of our still being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these things, and of our having failed to discover them, even after <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, reading, thinking, and reasoning, be this: that full <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> may be made not only of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with which we give instruction to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, but also of the humility with which we receive instruction from the learned?</p>

<p>10. Teach me, therefore, I beseech you, what I may teach to others; teach me what I ought to hold as my own opinion; and tell me this: if <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are from day to day made for each individual separately at birth, where, in the case of infant children, is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> committed by these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, so that they require the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because of sinning in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> from whom the sinful flesh has been derived? Or if they do not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, how is it compatible with the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the Creator, that, because of their being united to mortal members derived from another, they are so brought under the bond of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of that other, that unless they be rescued by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, perdition overtakes them, although it is not in their own power to secure that they be rescued by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? Where, therefore, is the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of the condemnation of so many thousands of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, which in the deaths of infant children leave this world without the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sacrament, if being newly created they have, not through any preceding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of their own, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Creator, become severally united to the individual bodies to animate which they were created and bestowed by Him, who certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that every one of them was destined, not through any fault of its own, to leave the body without receiving the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ? Seeing, therefore, that we may not say concerning God either that He compels them to become sinners, or that He punishes innocent <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and seeing that, on the other hand, it is not lawful for us to deny that nothing else than perdition is the doom of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, even of little children, which have departed from the body without the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, tell me, I implore you, where anything can be found to support the opinion that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are not all derived from that one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first man, but are each created separately for each individual, as Adam's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was made for him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>11. As for some other objections which are advanced against this opinion, I think that I could easily dispose of them. For example, some think that they urge a conclusive argument against this opinion when they ask, how God finished all His works on the sixth day and rested on the seventh day, <span class="stiki" id="note112731"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;2:2</a></span> if He is still creating new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. If we meet them with the quotation from the gospel (given by you in the letter to Marcellinus already mentioned), <q>My Father works hitherto,</q> they answer that He <q>works</q> in maintaining those natures which He has created, not in creating new natures; otherwise, this statement would contradict the words of Scripture in Genesis, where it is most plainly declared that God finished all His works. Moreover, the words of Scripture, that He rested, are unquestionably to be understood of His resting from creating new creatures, not from governing those which He had created; for at that time He made things which previously did not exist, and from making these He rested because He had finished all the creatures which before they <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> He saw necessary to be created, so that thenceforward He did not create and make things which previously did not exist, but made and fashioned out of things already existing whatever He did make. Thus the statements, <q>He rested from His works,</q> and, <q>He works hitherto,</q> are both <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, for the gospel could not contradict Genesis.</p>

<p>12. When, however, these things are brought forward by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who advance them as conclusive against the opinion that God now creates new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as He created the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first man, and who hold either that He forms them from that one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before He rested from creation, or that He now sends them forth into bodies from some reservoir or storehouse of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which He then created, it is easy to turn aside their argument by answering, that even in the six days God formed many things out of those natures which He had already created, as, for example, the birds and fishes were formed from the waters, and the trees, the grass, and the animals from the earth, and yet it is undeniable that He was then making things which did not exist before. For there <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> previously no bird, no fish, no tree, no animal, and it is clearly understood that He rested from creating those things which previously were not, and were then created, that is to say, He ceased in this sense, that, after that, nothing was made by Him which did not already exist. But if, rejecting the opinions of all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> either that God sends forth into men <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> existing already in some incomprehensible reservoir, or that He makes <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> emanate like drops of dew from Himself as particles of His own substance, or that He brings them forth from that one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the first man, or that He binds them in the fetters of the bodily members because of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> committed in a prior state of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, if, I say, rejecting these, we affirm that for each individual He creates separately a new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when he is born, we do not herein affirm that He makes anything which he had not already made. For He had already made man after His own image on the sixth day; and this work of His is unquestionably to be understood with reference to the rational <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man. The same work He still does, not in creating what did not exist, but in multiplying what already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>. Wherefore it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, on the one hand, that He rested from creating things which previously did not exist, and equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, on the other hand, that He continues still to work, not only in governing what He has made, but also in making (not anything which did not previously exist, but) a larger number of those creatures which He had already made. Wherefore, either by such an explanation, or by any other which may seem better, we escape from the objection advanced by those who would make the fact that God rested from His works a conclusive argument against our believing that new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are still being daily created, not from the first <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in the same manner as it was made.</p>

<p>13. Again, as for another objection, stated in the question, <q>Wherefore does He create <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for those whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be destined to an early death?</q> we may reply, that by the death of the children the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are either reproved or chastised. We may, moreover, with all propriety, leave these things to the disposal of the Lord of all, for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he appoints to the succession of events in time, and therefore to the births and deaths of living creatures as included in these, a course which is consummate in beauty and perfect in the arrangement of all its parts; whereas we are not capable of perceiving those things by the perception of which, if it were attainable, we should be soothed with an ineffable, tranquil <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For not in vain has the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, taught by divine inspiration, declared concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>He brings forth in measured harmonies the course of time.</q>  For which reason music, the science or capacity of correct harmony, has been given also by the kindness of God to mortals having reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, with a view to keep them in mind of this great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when composing a song which is to suit a particular melody, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to distribute the length of time allowed to each word so as to make the song flow and pass on in most beautiful adaptation to the ever-changing notes of the melody, how much more shall <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose wisdom is to be esteemed as infinitely transcending <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> arts, make infallible provision that not one of the spaces of time alloted to natures that are born and die&mdash; spaces which are like the words and syllables of the successive epochs of the course of time&mdash; shall have, in what we may call the sublime psalm of the vicissitudes of this world, a duration either more brief or more protracted than the foreknown  and predetermined harmony requires! For when I may speak thus with reference even to the leaves of every tree, and the number of the hairs upon our heads, how much more may I say it regarding the birth and death of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, seeing that every man's life on earth continues for a time, which is neither longer nor shorter than God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be in harmony with the plan according to which He rules the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>.</p>

<p>14. As to the assertion that everything which has begun to exist in time is incapable of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, because all things which are born die, and all things which have grown decay through age, and the opinion which they affirm to follow necessarily from this, viz. that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man must owe its <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> to its having been created before time began, this does not disturb my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for, passing over other examples, which conclusively dispose of this assertion, I need only refer to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which now <q>dies no more; death shall have no more dominion over it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112733"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;6:9</a></span> </p>

<p>15. Moreover, as to your remark in your book against Ruffinus, that some bring forward as against this opinion that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are created for each individual separately at birth the objection that it seems worthy of God that He should give <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to the offspring of adulterers, and who accordingly attempt to build on this a theory that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> may possibly be incarcerated, as it were, in such bodies, to suffer for the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of a life spent in some prior state of being, &mdash; this objection does not disturb me, as many things by which it may be answered occur to me when I consider it. The answer which you yourself have given, saying, that in the case of stolen wheat, there is no fault in the grain, but only in him who stole it, and that the earth is not under obligation to refuse to cherish the seed because the sower may have cast it in with a hand defiled by dishonesty, is a most felicitous illustration. But even before I had read it, I felt that to me the objection drawn from the offspring of adulterers caused no serious difficulty when I took a general view of the fact that God brings many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to light, even out of our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> and our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now, the creation of any living creature compels every one who considers it with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and wisdom to give to the Creator praise which words cannot express; and if this praise is called forth by the creation of any living creature whatsoever, how much more is it called forth by the creation of a man! If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of any act of creative power be sought for, no shorter or better reply can be given than that every creature of God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And [so far from such an act being unworthy of God] what is more worthy of Him than that He, being good, should make those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which, no one else than God alone can make?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>16. These things, and others which I can advance, I am accustomed to state, as well as I can, against those who attempt to overthrow by such objections the opinion that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are made for each individual, as the first man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was made for him.</p>

<p>But when we come to the penal sufferings of infants, I am embarrassed, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, by great difficulties, and am wholly at a loss to find an answer by which they are solved; and I speak here not only of those punishments in the life to come, which are involved in that perdition to which they must be drawn down if they depart from the body without the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but also of the sufferings which are to our sorrow endured by them before our eyes in this present life, and which are so various, that time rather than examples would fail me if I were to attempt to enumerate them. They are liable to wasting disease, to racking pain, to the agonies of thirst and hunger, to feebleness of limbs, to privation of bodily senses, and to vexing assaults of unclean spirits. Surely it is incumbent on us to show how it is compatible with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that infants suffer all these things without any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of their own as the procuring <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For it would be impious to say, either that these things take place without God's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or that He cannot resist those who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them, or that He unrighteously does these things, or permits them to be done. We are warranted in saying that irrational animals are given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to serve creatures possessing a higher nature, even though they be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, as we see most plainly in the gospel that the swine of the Gadarenes were given to the legion of devils at their request; but could we ever be warranted in saying this of men? Certainly not. Man is, indeed, an animal, but an animal endowed with reason, though mortal. In his members dwells a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which in these severe afflictions is enduring a penalty. Now God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, God is just, God is <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a>&mdash; none but a madman would <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he is so; let the great sufferings, therefore, which infant children experience be accounted for by some reason compatible with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. When older people suffer such trials, we are accustomed, certainly, to say, either that their worth is being <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, as in Job's case, or that their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is being punished, as in <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a>; and from some examples, which it has pleased God to make perfectly clear, men are enabled to conjecture the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of others which are more obscure; but this is in regard to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of mature age. Tell me, therefore, what we must answer in regard to infant children; is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, although they suffer so great punishments, there are no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in them deserving to be punished? For, of course, there is not in them at that age any righteousness requiring to be put to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>.</p>

<p>17. What shall I say, moreover, as to the [difficulty which besets the theory of the creation of each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> separately at the birth of the individual in connection with the] diversity of talent in different <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and especially the absolute privation of reason in some? This is, indeed, not apparent in the first stages of infancy, but being developed continuously from the beginning of life, it becomes manifest in children, of whom some are so slow and defective in memory that they cannot learn even the letters of the alphabet, and some (commonly called idiots) so imbecile that they differ very little from the beasts of the field. Perhaps I am told, in answer to this, that the bodies are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these imperfections. But surely the opinion which we wish to see vindicated from objection does not require us to affirm that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> chose for itself the body which so impairs it, and, being deceived in the choice, committed a blunder; or that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when it was compelled, as a necessary consequence of being born, to enter into some body, was hindered from finding another by crowds of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> occupying the other bodies before it came, so that, like a man who takes whatever seat may remain vacant for him in a theatre, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was guided in taking possession of the imperfect body not by its choice, but by its circumstances. We, of course, cannot say and ought not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> such things. Tell us, therefore, what we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and to say in order to vindicate from this difficulty the theory that for each individual body a new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is specially created.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>18. In my books on <em>Free Will</em>, already referred to, I have said something, not in regard to the variety of capacities in different <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but, at least, in regard to the pains which infant children suffer in this life. The nature of the opinion which I there expressed, and the reason why it is insufficient for the purposes of our present inquiry, I will now submit to you, and will put into this letter a copy of the passage in the third book to which I refer. It is as follows:&mdash; <q>In connection with the bodily sufferings experienced by the little children who, by reason of their tender age, have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash; if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which animate them did not exist before they were born into the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>&mdash; a more grievous and, as it were, compassionate complaint is very commonly made in the remark, 'What <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> have they done that they should suffer these things?' as if there could be a meritorious innocence in any one before the time at which it is possible for him to do anything wrong! Moreover, if God accomplishes, in any measure, the correction of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> when they are chastised by the sufferings or by the death of the children that are dear to them, is there any reason why these things should not take place, seeing that, after they are passed, they will be, to those who experienced them, as if they had never been, while the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> on whose account they were inflicted will either become better, being moved by the rod of temporal afflictions to choose a better mode of life, or be left without excuse under the punishment awarded at the coming judgment, if, notwithstanding the sorrows of this life, they have refused to turn their desires towards <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life? Morever, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what may be given to the little children by means of whose sufferings the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> have their obdurate hearts subdued, or their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> exercised, or their compassion <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>? Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what good recompense God may, in the secret of his judgments, reserve for these little ones? For although they have done no righteous action, nevertheless, being free from any transgression of their own, they have suffered these trials. It is certainly not without reason that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exalts to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> rank of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> those children who were slain when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> sought <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> to put Him to death.</q> </p>

<p>19. These things I wrote at that time when I was endeavouring to defend the opinion which is now under discussion. For, as I mentioned shortly before, I was labouring to prove that whichever of these four opinions regarding the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> may be found <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the substance of the Creator is absolutely free from blame, and is completely removed from all share in our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And, therefore, whichever of these opinions might come to be established or demolished by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, this had no bearing on the object aimed at in the work which I was then attempting, seeing that whichever opinion might win the victory over all the rest, after they had been examined in a more thorough discussion, this would take place without causing me any disquietude, because my object then was to prove that, even admitting all these opinions, the doctrine maintained by me remained unshaken. But now my object is, by the force of sound reasoning, to select, if possible, one opinion out of the four; and, therefore, when I carefully consider the words now quoted from that book, I do not see that the arguments there used in defending the opinion which we are now discussing are valid and conclusive.</p>

<p>20. For what may be called the chief prop of my defence is in the sentence, <q>Moreover, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what may be given to the little children, by means of whose sufferings the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> have their obdurate hearts subdued, or their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> exercised, or their compassion <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>? Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what good recompense God may, in the secret of His judgments, reserve for these little ones?</q> I see that this is not an unwarranted conjecture in the case of infants who, in any way, suffer (though they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not) for the sake of Christ and in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, and of infants who have already been made partakers of the sacrament of Christ; because, apart from union to the one Mediator, they cannot be delivered from condemnation, and so put in a position in which it is even possible that a recompense could be made to them for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which, in diverse afflictions, they have endured in this world. But since the question cannot be fully solved, unless the answer include also the case of those who, without having received the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> fellowship, die in infancy after enduring the most painful sufferings, what recompense can be conceived of in their case, seeing that, besides all that they suffer in this life, perdition awaits them in the life to come? As to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants, I have, in the same book, given an answer, not, indeed, fully, but so far as seemed necessary for the work which then occupied me, proving that it profits children, even though they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is, and have, as yet, no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of their own; but on the subject of the perdition of those infants who depart from this life without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, I did not think it necessary to say anything then, because the question under discussion was different from that with which we are now engaged.</p>

<p>21. If, however, we pass over and make no account of those sufferings which are of brief continuance, and which, when endured, are not to be repeated, we certainly cannot, in like manner, make no account of the fact that <q>by one man death came, and by one man came also the resurrection of the dead; for as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112736"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:21-22</a></span> For, according to this <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a>, divine, and perspicuous declaration, it is sufficiently plain that no one goes to death otherwise than through Adam, and that no one goes to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> otherwise than through Christ. For this is the force of <em>all</em> in the two parts of the sentence; as all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, by their first, that is, their natural birth, belong to Adam, even so all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whoever they be, who come to Christ come to the second, that is, the spiritual birth. For this reason, therefore, the word <em>all</em> is used in both clauses, because as all who die do not die otherwise than in Adam, so all who shall be made alive shall not be made alive otherwise than in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Wherefore whosoever tells us that any man can be made alive in the resurrection of the dead otherwise than in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is to be detested as a pestilent enemy to the common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Likewise, whosoever says that those children who depart out of this life without partaking of that sacrament shall be made alive in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, certainly contradicts the apostolic declaration, and condemns the universal Church, in which it is the practice to lose no time and run in haste to administer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to infant children, because it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, as an indubitable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that otherwise they cannot be made alive in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Now he that is not made alive in Christ must necessarily remain under the condemnation, of which the apostle says, that <q>by the offense of one judgment came upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to condemnation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112737"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;5:18</a></span> That infants are born under the guilt of this offense is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is also a doctrine which you have most faithfully set forth, both in your treatise against Jovinian and your exposition of Jonah, as I mentioned above, and, if I am not mistaken, in other parts of your works which I have not read or have at present forgotten. I therefore ask, what is the ground of this condemnation of unbaptized infants? For if new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are made for men, individually, at their birth, I do not see, on the one hand, that they could have any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> while yet in infancy, nor do I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, on the other hand, that God condemns any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which He sees to have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>22. Are we perchance to say, in answer to this, that in the infant the body alone is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but that for each body a new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is made, and that if this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> live according to the precepts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by the help of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the reward of being made incorruptible may be secured for the body itself, when subdued and kept under the yoke; and that inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of an infant cannot yet do this, unless it receive the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that which could not yet be obtained for the body by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is obtained for it by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of this sacrament; but if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of an infant depart without the sacrament, it shall itself dwell in life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, from which it could not be separated, as it had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while, however, the body which it occupied shall not rise again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because the sacrament had not been received before its death?</p>

<p>23. This opinion I have never heard or read anywhere. I have, however, certainly heard and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the statement which led me to speak thus, namely, <q>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life,</q>&mdash; the resurrection, namely, of which it is said that <q>by one man came the resurrection of the dead,</q> and in which <q>all shall be made alive in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q>&mdash; <q>and they that have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, unto the resurrection of damnation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112738"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;5:29</a></span> Now, what is to be understood regarding infants which, before they could do good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, have quitted the body without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? Nothing is said here concerning them. But if the bodies of these infants shall not rise again, because they have never done either good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the bodies of the infants that have died after receiving the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> shall also have no resurrection, because they also were not in this life able to do good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. If, however, these are to rise among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <em>i.e.</em> among those who have done good, among whom shall the others rise again but among those who have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash; unless we are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall not receive, either in the resurrection of life, or in the resurrection of damnation, the bodies which they lost in death? This opinion, however, is condemned, even before it is formally refuted, by its absolute novelty; and besides this, who could bear to think that those who run with their infant children to have them <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, are prompted to do so by a regard for their bodies, not for their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? The blessed Cyprian, indeed, said, in order to correct those who thought that an infant should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before the eighth day, that it was not the body but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which behooved to be saved from perdition&mdash; in which statement he was not inventing any new doctrine, but preserving the firmly established <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and he, along with some of his colleagues in the episcopal office, held that a child may be properly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> immediately after its birth. </p>

<p>24. Let every man, however, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything which commends itself to his own judgment, even though it run counter to some opinion of Cyprian, who may not have seen in the matter what should have been seen. But let no man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything which runs counter to the perfectly unambiguous <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> declaration, that by the offense of one all are brought into condemnation, and that from this condemnation nothing sets men free but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, in whom alone life is given to all who are made alive. And let no man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> anything which runs counter to the firmly grounded practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in which, if the sole reason for hastening the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> were to save the children, the dead as well as the living would be brought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<p>25. These things being so, it is necessary still to investigate and to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the reason why, if <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are created new for every individual at his birth, those who die in infancy without the sacrament of Christ are doomed to perdition; for that they are doomed to this if they so depart from the body is testified both by <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church. Wherefore, as to that opinion of yours concerning the creation of new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, if it does not contradict this firmly grounded article of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, let it be mine also; but if it does, let it be no longer yours.</p>

<p>26. Let it not be said to me that we ought to receive as supporting this opinion the words of Scripture in Zechariah, <q>He forms the spirit of man within him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112740"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse1">Zechariah&nbsp;12:1</a></span> and in the book of Psalms, <q>He forms their hearts severally.</q>  We must seek for the strongest and most indisputable <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, that we may not be compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God is a judge who condemns any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has no fault. For to create signifies either as much or, probably, more than to form [<em>fingere</em>]; nevertheless it is written, <q>Create in me a clean heart, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  and yet it cannot be supposed that a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> here expresses a desire to be made before it has begun to exist. Therefore, as it is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> already existing which is created by being renewed in righteousness, so it is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> already existing which is formed by the moulding power of doctrine. Nor is your opinion, which I would willingly make my own, supported by that sentence in Ecclesiastes, <q>Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who gave it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112743"><a href="../bible/ecc012.htm#verse7">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;12:7</a></span> Nay, it rather favours those who think that all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are derived from one; for they say that, as the dust returns to the earth as it was, and yet the body of which this is said returns not to the man from whom it was derived, but to the earth from which the first man was made, the spirit in like manner, though derived from the spirit of the first man, does not return to him but to the Lord, by whom it was given to our first parent. Since, however, the testimony of this passage in their favour is not so decisive as to make it appear altogether opposed to the opinion which I shall gladly see vindicated, I thought proper to submit these remarks on it to your judgment, to prevent you from endeavouring to deliver me from my perplexities by quoting passages such as these. For although no man's wishes can make that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, nevertheless, were this possible, I would wish that this opinion should be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as I do wish that, if it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it should be most clearly and unanswerably vindicated by you.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>27. The same difficulty attends those also who hold that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> already existing elsewhere, and prepared from the beginning of the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are sent by Him into bodies. For to these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> also the same question may be put: If these <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, being without any fault, go obediently to the bodies to which they are sent, why are they subjected to punishment in the case of infants, if they come without being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> to the end of this life? The same difficulty unquestionably attaches to both opinions. Those who affirm that each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is, according to the deserts of its actions in an earlier state of being, united to the body alloted to it in this life, <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they escape more easily from this difficulty. For they think that to <q>die in Adam</q> means to suffer punishment in that flesh which is derived from Adam, from which condition of guilt the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they say, delivers the young as well as the old. So far, indeed, they teach what is right, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and excellent, when they say that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ delivers the young as well as the old from the guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in another earlier life, and that for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in that state of being they are cast down into bodies as prisons, I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: I reject and protest against such an opinion. I do this, in the first place, because they affirm that this is accomplished by means of some incomprehensible revolutions, so that after I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how many cycles the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must return again to the same burden of corruptible flesh and to the endurance of punishment&mdash;than which opinion I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that anything more horrible could be conceived. In the next place, who is the righteous man gone from the earth about whom we should not (if what they say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>) feel afraid lest, sinning in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, he should be cast down into the flames which tormented the rich man in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note112744"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;16:22-23</a></span> For why may the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after leaving the body, if it can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before entering it? Finally, to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in Adam (in regard to which the apostle says that in him all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>) is one thing, but it is a wholly different thing to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not where, outside of Adam, and then because of this to be thrust into Adam&mdash; that is, into the body, which is derived from Adam, as into a prison-house. As to the other opinion mentioned above, that all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are derived from one, I will not begin to discuss it unless I am under necessity to do so; and my desire is, that if the opinion which we are now discussing is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it may be so vindicated by you that there shall be no longer any necessity for examining the other.</p>

<p>28. Although, however, I desire and ask, and with fervent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> wish and hope, that by you the Lord may remove my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> on this subject, if, after all, I am found unworthy to obtain this, I will beg the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of patience from the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom we have such <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that even if there be some things which He does not open to us when we knock, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it would be wrong to murmur in the least against Him. I remember what He said to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves: <q>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112745"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;16:12</a></span> Among these things, so far at least as I am concerned, let me still reckon this, and let me guard against being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> that I am deemed unworthy to possess this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, lest by such <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> I be all the more clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be unworthy. I am equally <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of many other things, yea, of more than I could name or even number; and of this I would be more patiently <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, were it not that I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest some one of these opinions, involving the contradiction of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which we most assuredly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, should insinuate itself into the minds of the unwary. Meanwhile, though I do not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which of these opinions is to be preferred, this one thing I profess as my deliberate conviction, that the opinion which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> does not conflict with that most firm and well grounded article in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that infant children, even when they are newly born, can be delivered from perdition in no other way than through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name, which He has given in His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.</p>
