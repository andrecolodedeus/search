<h1>From Jerome to Alypius and Augustine (A.D. 419)</h1>

<p> <em>To the Bishops Alypius and Augustine, My Lords Truly Holy, and Deservedly Loved and Reverenced, Jerome Sends Greeting in Christ. </em></p>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Innocentius, who is the bearer of this letter, did not last year take with him a letter from me to your Eminences, as he had no expectation of returning to Africa. We thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however, that it so happened, as it afforded you an opportunity of overcoming [<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with good in requiting] our silence by your letter. Every opportunity of writing to you, revered fathers, is most acceptable to me. I call God to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that, if it were possible, I would take the wings of a dove and fly to be folded in your embrace. Loving you, indeed, as I have always done, from a deep sense of your worth, but now especially because your co-operation and your leadership have succeeded in strangling the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Celestius, a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which has so poisoned the hearts of many, that, though they felt they were vanquished and condemned, yet they did not lay aside their venomous sentiments, and, as the only thing that remained in their power, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> us by whom they imagined that they had lost the liberty of teaching <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines.</p>

<p>2. As to your inquiry whether I have written in opposition to the books of Annianus, this pretended <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>  of Celed&aelig;, who is amply provided for in order that he may furnish frivolous accounts of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> of others, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I received these books, sent in loose sheets by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Eusebius, not long ago. Since then I have suffered so much through the attacks of disease, and through the falling asleep of your distinguished and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> daughter <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, that I almost thought of passing over these writings with silent contempt. For he flounders from beginning to end in the same mud, and, with the exception of some jingling phrases which are not original, says nothing he had not said before. Nevertheless, I have gained much in the fact, that in attempting to answer my letter he has declared his opinions with less reserve, and has published to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>; for every <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which he disowned in the wretched synod of Diospolis he in this treatise openly avows. It is indeed no great thing to answer his superlatively silly puerilities, but if the Lord spare me, and I have a sufficient staff of amanuenses, I will in a few brief lucubrations answer him, not to refute a defunct <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but to silence his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> by arguments: and this your Holiness could do better than I, as you would relieve me from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of praising my own works in writing to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> daughters Albina and Melania, and our son Pinianus, salute you cordially. I give to our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Innocentius this short letter to convey to you from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. Your niece <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> piteously entreats you to remember her, and salutes you warmly. May the mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> preserve you safe and mindful of me, my lords <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and fathers deservedly loved and reverenced.</p>
