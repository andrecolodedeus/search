<h1>From Jerome to Augustine (A.D. 404)</h1>

<p> <em>To Augustine, My Lord Truly Holy, and Most Blessed Father, Jerome Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. You are sending me letter upon letter, and often urging me to answer a certain letter of yours, a copy of which, without your signature, had reached me through our brother Sysinnius, <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, as I have already written, which letter you tell me that you entrusted first to our brother Profuturus, and afterwards to some one else; but that Profuturus was prevented from finishing his intended journey, and having been ordained a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, was removed by sudden death; and the second messenger, whose name you do not give, was afraid of the perils of the sea, and gave up the voyage which he had intended. These things being so, I am at a loss to express my surprise that the same letter is reported to be in the possession of most of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and has come to every one but myself, to whom alone it was ostensibly sent. I wonder at this all the more, because the brother Sysinnius aforesaid tells me that he found it among the rest of your published works, not in Africa, not in your possession, but in an island of the Adriatic some five years ago.</p>

<p>2. True friendship can harbour no suspicion; a friend must speak to his friend as freely as to his second self. Some of my acquaintances, vessels of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of whom there is a very large number in Jerusalem and in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, suggested to me that this had not been done by you in a guileless spirit, but through desire for praise and celebrity, and <em>&eacute;clat</em> in the eyes of the people, intending to become famous at my expense; that many might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you challenged me, and I feared to meet you; that you had written as a man of learning, and I had by silence confessed my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and had at last found one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to stop my garrulous tongue. I, however, let me say it frankly, refused at first to answer your Excellency, because I did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the letter, or as I may call it (using a proverbial expression), the honeyed sword, was sent from you. Moreover, I was cautious lest I should seem to answer uncourteously a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of my own communion, and to censure anything in the letter of one who censured me, especially as I judged some of its statements to be tainted with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.  Lastly, I was afraid lest you should have reason to remonstrate with me, saying, <q>What! Had you seen the letter to be mine&mdash;had you discovered in the signature attached to it the autograph of a hand well known to you, when you so carelessly wounded the feelings of your friend, and reproached me with that which the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of another had conceived?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>3. Wherefore, as I have already written, either send me the identical letter in question subscribed with your own hand, or desist from annoying an old man, who seeks retirement in his monastic cell. If you wish to exercise or display your learning, choose as your antagonists, young, eloquent, and illustrious men, of whom it is said that many are found in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, who may be neither unable nor afraid to meet you, and to enter the lists with a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in debates concerning the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a>. As for me, a soldier once, but a retired veteran now, it becomes me rather to applaud the victories won by you and others, than with my worn-out body to take part in the conflict; beware lest, if you persist in demanding a reply, I call to mind the history of the way in which Quintus Maximus by his patience defeated Hannibal, who was, in the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of youth, confident of success. </p>

<blockquote><p>Omnia fert &aelig;tas, animum quoque. S&aelig;pe ego longos
<br>Cantando puerum memini me condere soles;
<br>Nunc oblita mihi tot carmina: vox quoque M&oelig;rin
<br>Jam fugit ipsa. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>Or rather, to quote an instance from Scripture: Barzillai of Gilead, when he declined in favour of his youthful son the kindnesses of King David and all the charms of his court, taught us that old age ought neither to desire these things, nor to accept them when offered.</p>

<p>4. As to your calling God to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that you had not written a book against me, and of course had not sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> what you had never written, adding that, if perchance some things were found in your works in which a different opinion from mine was advanced, no wrong had thereby been done to me, because you had, without any intention of offending me, written only what you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be right; I beg you to hear me with patience. You never wrote a book against me: how then has there been brought to me a copy, written by another hand, of a treatise containing a rebuke administered to me by you? How comes <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> to possess a treatise of yours which you did not write? Nay, how can you reasonably ask me to reply to that which you solemnly assure me was never written by you? Nor am I so foolish as to think that I am insulted by you, if in anything your opinion differs from mine. But if, challenging me as it were to single combat, you take exception to my views, and demand a reason for what I have written, and insist upon my correcting what you judge to be an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and call upon me to recant it in a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;&#x1FF3;&#x03B4;&#x03B9;<!--k29--'&#x03B1;</span>, and speak of your curing me of blindness; in this I maintain that friendship is wounded, and the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of brotherly union are set at nought. Let not the world see us quarrelling like children, and giving material for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> contention between those who may become our respective supporters or adversaries. I write what I have now written, because I desire to cherish towards you pure and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and not to hide in my heart anything which does not agree with the utterance of my lips. For it does not become me, who have spent my life from youth until now, sharing the arduous labours of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> brethren in an obscure <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, to presume to write anything against a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of my own communion, especially against one whom I had begun to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> before I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him, who also sought my friendship before I sought his, and whom I rejoiced to see rising as a successor to myself in the careful study of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. Wherefore either disown that book, if you are not its author, and give over urging me to reply to that which you never wrote; or if the book is yours, admit it frankly; so that if I write anything in self-defence, the responsibility may lie on you who gave, not on me who am forced to accept, the challenge.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>5. You say also, that if there be anything in your writings which has displeased me, and which I would wish to correct, you are ready to receive my criticism as a brother; and you not only assure me that you would <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of my goodwill toward you, but you earnestly ask me to do this. I tell you again, without reserve, what I feel: you are challenging an old man, disturbing the peace of one who asks only to be allowed to be silent, and you seem to desire to display your learning. It is not for one of my years to give the impression of enviously disparaging one whom I ought rather to encourage by approbation. And if the ingenuity of perverse men finds something which they may plausibly censure in the writings even of <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, are you amazed if, in your books, especially in your exposition of passages in Scripture which are exceedingly difficult of interpretation, some things be found which are not perfectly correct? This I say, however, not because I can at this time pronounce anything in your works to merit censure. For, in the first place, I have never read them with attention; and in the second place, we have not beside us a supply of copies of what you have written, excepting the books of Soliloquies and Commentaries on some of the Psalms; which, if I were disposed to criticise them, I could prove to be at variance, I shall not say with my own opinion, for I am nobody, but with the interpretations of the older Greek commentators.</p>

<p>Farewell, my very dear friend, my son in years, my father in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dignity; and to this I most particularly request your attention, that henceforth you make sure that I be the first to receive whatever you may write to me.</p>
