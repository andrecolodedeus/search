<h1>From Jerome to Augustine (A.D. 405)</h1>

<p> <em>To Augustine, My Lord Truly Holy, and Most Blessed Father, Jerome Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>Having anxiously inquired of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother Firmus regarding your state, I was glad to hear that you are well. I expected him to bring, or, I should rather say, I insisted upon his giving me, a letter from you; upon which he told me that he had set out from Africa without communicating to you his intention. I therefore send to you my respectful salutations through this brother, who clings to you with a singular warmth of affection; and at the same time, in regard to my last letter, I beg you to forgive the modesty which made it impossible for me to refuse you, when you had so long required me to write you in reply. That letter, moreover, was not an answer from me to you, but a confronting of my arguments with yours. And if it was a fault in me to send a reply (I beseech you hear me patiently), the fault of him who insisted upon it was still greater. But let us be done with such quarrelling; let there be sincere brotherliness between us; and henceforth let us exchange letters, not of controversy, but of mutual charity. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren who with me serve the Lord send you cordial salutations. Salute from us the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren who with you bear Christ's easy yoke; especially I beseech you to convey my respectful salutation to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father Alypius, worthy of all esteem. May Christ, our almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, preserve you safe, and not unmindful of me, my lord <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and most blessed father. If you have read my commentary on Jonah, I think you will not recur to the ridiculous gourd-debate. If, moreover, the friend who first assaulted me with his sword has been driven back by my pen, I rely upon your good feeling and equity to lay blame on the one who brought, and not on the one who repelled, the accusation. Let us, if you please, exercise ourselves  in the field of Scripture without wounding each other.</p>
