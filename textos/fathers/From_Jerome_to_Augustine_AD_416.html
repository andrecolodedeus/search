<h1>From Jerome to Augustine (A.D. 416)</h1>

<p> <em>To Augustine, My Truly Pious Lord and Father, Worthy of My Utmost Affection and Veneration, Jerome Sends Greeting in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</em></p>

<p>1. That <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> man, my brother, and your Excellency's son, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> <a href="../cathen/11322a.htm">Orosius</a>, I have, both on his own account and in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to your request, made welcome. But a most trying time has come upon us,  in which I have found it better for me to hold my peace than to speak, so that our studies have ceased, lest what Appius calls <q>the eloquence of dogs</q> should be provoked into exercise.  For this reason I have not been able at the present time to give to those two books dedicated to my name&mdash; books of profound erudition, and brilliant with every charm of splendid eloquence&mdash; the answer which I would otherwise have given; not that I think anything said in them demands correction, but because I am mindful of the words of the blessed apostle in regard to the variety of men's judgments, <q>Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</q>  Certainly, whatever can be said on the topics there discussed, and whatever can be drawn by commanding genius from the fountain of sacred Scripture regarding them, has been in these letters stated in your positions, and illustrated by your arguments. But I beg your Reverence to allow me for a little to praise your genius. For in any discussion between us, the object aimed at by both of us is advancement in learning. But our rivals, and especially <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, if they see different opinions maintained by us, will assail us with the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> that our differences are due to mutual jealousy. For my part, however, I am resolved to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, to look up to you, to reverence and admire you, and to defend your opinions as my own. I have also in a dialogue, which I recently published, made allusion to your Blessedness in suitable terms. Be it ours, therefore, rather to rid the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of that most pernicious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which always feigns repentance, in order that it may have liberty to teach in our churches, and may not be expelled and extinguished, as it would be if it disclosed its real character in the light of day.</p>

<p>2. Your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and venerable daughters, <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> and <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, continue to walk worthy of their own birth and of your counsels, and they send special salutations to your Blessedness: in which they are joined by the whole brotherhood of those who with us labour to serve the Lord our Saviour. As for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Firmus, we sent him last year to go on business of <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> and <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, first to Ravenna, and afterwards to Africa and <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, and we suppose that he is now detained somewhere in Africa. I beseech you to present my respectful salutations to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are associated with you. I have also sent to your care a letter from me to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Firmus; if it reaches you, I beg you to take the trouble of forwarding it to him. May Christ the Lord keep you in safety, and mindful of me, my <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> lord and most blessed father.</p>

<p>(<em>As a postscript.</em>) We suffer in this province from a grievous scarcity of clerks acquainted with the Latin language; this is the reason why we are not able to comply with your instructions, especially in regard to that version of the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> which is furnished with distinctive asterisks and obelisks;  for we have lost, through some one's dishonesty, the most of the results of our earlier labour.</p>
