<h1>From the Teaching of Addaeus the Apostle</h1>


<p><span class="sc">. . . . Add&aelig;us </span> said to him: Because you have thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, I lay my hand upon you in the name of Him in whom you have thus <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And at the very moment that he laid his hand upon him he was healed of the plague of the disease which he had for a long time.  And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> was astonished and marvelled, because, like as he had heard about Jesus, how He wrought and healed, so Add&aelig;us also, without any medicine whatever, was healing in the name of Jesus. And Abdu also, son of Abdu, had the gout in his feet; and he also presented his feet to him, and he laid his hand upon them, and healed him, and he had the gout no more. And in all the city also he wrought great cures, and showed forth wonderful mighty-works in it.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> said to him: Now that every man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that by the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> you do these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and lo! We are astonished at your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, I therefore entreat of you to relate to us the story about the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in what manner it was, and about His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> power, and about the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which we have heard that He did, which you have yourself seen, together with your fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<p>Add&aelig;us said: I will not hold my peace from declaring this; since for this very purpose was I sent hither, that I might speak to and teach every one who is willing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, even as you. Assemble me tomorrow all the city, and I will sow in it the word of life by the preaching which I will address to you&mdash; about the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in what manner it was; and about Him that sent Him, why and how He sent Him; and about His power and His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">wonderful works</a>; and about the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of His coming, which He spoke of in the world; and about the unerring <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>  of His preaching; and how and for what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> He abused Himself, and humbled His exalted Godhead by the manhood which He took, and was crucified, and descended to the place of the dead, and broke through the enclosure <span class="stiki" id="note082964"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> which had never been broken through <em>before</em>, and gave life to the dead by being slain Himself, and descended alone, and ascended with many to His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Father, with whom He had been from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> in one exalted Godhead.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> commanded them to give to Add&aelig;us silver and gold. Add&aelig;us said to him: How can we receive that which is not ours. For, lo! That which was ours have we forsaken, as we were commanded by our Lord; because without purses and without scrips, bearing the cross upon our shoulders, were we commanded to preach His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in the whole creation, of whose crucifixion, which was for our sakes, for the redemption of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the whole creation was sensible and suffered pain.</p>

<p>And he related before <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a>, and before his princes and his nobles, and before Augustine, <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar's</a> mother, and before Shalmath,  the daughter of Meherdath,  <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar's</a> wife,  the signs of our Lord, and His wonders, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> mighty-works which He did, and His divine exploits, and His ascension to His Father; and how they had received power and authority at the same time that He was received up&mdash; by which same power it was that he had healed <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a>, and Abdu son of Abdu, the second person  of his kingdom; and how He informed them that He would reveal Himself at the end of the ages  and at the consummation of all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things; also <em>of</em> the resuscitation and resurrection which is to come for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the separation which will be made between the sheep and the goats, and between the faithful and those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</p>

<p>And he said to them: Because the gate of life is strait and the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> narrow, therefore are the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> few, and through unbelief is <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> gratification. Therefore are the liars many who lead astray those that see. For, were it not that there is a good end awaiting believing men, our Lord would not have descended from heaven, and come to be born, and to <em>endure</em> the suffering of death. Yet He did come, and us did He send. ..of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which we preach, that God was crucified for  all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>And, if there be those who are not willing  to agree with these our words, let them draw near to us and disclose to us what is in their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that, like as in the case of a disease, we may apply to their thoughts healing medicine for the cure of their ailments. For, though you were not present at the time of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> suffering, yet from the sun which was darkened, and which you saw, learn ye and understand concerning the great convulsion  which took place at that time, when He was crucified whose <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has winged its way through all the earth by the signs which His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> my fellows do in all the earth: yea, those who were Hebrews, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> only the language of the Hebrews, in which they were born, lo! At this day are speaking in all languages, in order that those who are afar off may hear and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, even as those who are near. For He it is that confounded the tongues of the presumptuous in this region who were before us; and He it is that teaches at this day the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and verity by us, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and despicable  men from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> of Palestine. For I also whom you see am from Paneas,  from the place where the river Jordan issues forth, and I was chosen, together with my fellows, to be a preacher.</p>

<p>For, according as my Lord commanded me, lo! I preach and publish the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and lo! His money do I cast upon the table before you, and the seed of His word do I sow in the ears of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and such as are willing to receive it, theirs is the good recompense of the confession <em>of Christ;</em> but those who are not persuaded, the dust of my feet do I shake off against them, as He commanded me.</p>

<p>Repent therefore, my beloved, of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways and of abominable <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and turn yourselves towards Him with a good and honest will, as He has turned Himself towards you with the favour of His rich mercies; and be not as the generations of former times that have passed away, which, because they hardened their heart against the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, received punishment openly, that they themselves might be chastised, and that those who come after them may tremble and be afraid. For the purpose of our Lord's coming into the world assuredly was,  that He might teach us and show us that at the consummation of the creation there will be a resuscitation of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and that at that time their course of conduct will be portrayed in their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and their bodies will be volumes for the writings of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; nor will any one be there who is unacquainted with books, because every one will read that which is written in His own book. </p>

<p>You that have eyes, forasmuch as you do not perceive, are yourselves also become like those who see not and hear not; and in vain do your ineffectual voices strain themselves to deaf  ears. Whilst <em>they</em> are not to be blamed for not hearing, because they are by  nature deaf and dumb, yet the blame which is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> incurred falls upon you,  because you are not willing to perceive&mdash; not even that which you see. For the dark cloud of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which overspreads your minds suffers you not to obtain the heavenly light, which is the understanding of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. </p>

<p>Flee, then, from things made and created, as I said to you, which are only called gods in name, while they are not gods in their nature; and draw near to this <em>Being</em>, who in His nature is God from everlasting and from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and is not something made, like your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, nor is He a creature and a work of art, like those images in which you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Because, although this  <em>Being</em> put on a body, <em>yet</em> is He God with His Father. For the works of creation, which trembled when He was slain and were dismayed at His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> of death&mdash;these bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that He is Himself God the Creator. For it was not on account of a man that the earth trembled,  but on account  of Him who established the earth upon the waters; nor was it on account of a man that the sun grew dark in the heavens, but on account of Him who made the great lights; nor was it for a man that the just and righteous were restored to life again, but for Him who had granted power over death from the beginning; nor was it for a man that the veil of the temple of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was rent from the top to the bottom, but for Him who said to them, <q>Lo, your house is left desolate.</q> For, lo! unless those who crucified Him had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, they would not have had to proclaim  the desolation  of their city, nor would they have brought down Woe! upon themselves.  For, even if they had wished to make light of this confession,  the fearful convulsions which took place at that time would not have suffered them to do so. For lo! some even of the children of the crucifiers have become at this day preachers and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, along with my fellow <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in all the land of Palestine, and among the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, and in all the country of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> also of paganism are despised, and the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is honoured, and <em>all</em> nations and creatures confess God who became man.</p>

<p>If, therefore, while Jesus our Lord was on earth ye would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and before ye had heard the word of His preaching would have confessed Him that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; now that He is ascended to His Father, and you have seen the signs and the wonders which are done in His name, and have heard with your own ears the word of His <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, let no one of you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in his mind&mdash; so that the promise of His blessing which He sent to you may be fulfilled  towards you: Blessed are you that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in me, not having seen me; and, because you have so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in me, the town  in which you dwell shall be blessed, and the enemy shall not prevail against it for ever.  Turn not away, therefore, from his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: for, lo! You have heard and seen what things bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; <em>showing</em> that He is the adorable Son, and is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is the victorious King, and is the mighty Power; and through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him a man is able to acquire the eyes of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  and to understand that, whosoever worships creatures, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> will overtake him.</p>

<p>For <em>in</em> everything which we speak before you, according as we have received of the gift of our Lord, <em>so</em> speak we and teach and declare <em>it</em>, that you may secure  your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and not destroy  your spirits through the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of paganism: because the heavenly light has arisen on the creation, and He it is who chose the fathers of former times, and the righteous men, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and spoke with them in the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.  For He is Himself the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who crucified Him; and to Him it is that the erring <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> offer worship, even while they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not: because there is no other God in heaven and on earth; and lo! confession ascends up to Him from the four quarters of the creation. Lo! Therefore, your ears have heard that which was not heard by you; and lo! Further, your eyes have seen that which was never seen by you. </p>

<p>Be not, therefore, gainsayers of that which you have seen and heard. Put away from you the rebellious mind of your fathers, and free yourselves from the yoke of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which has dominion over you in libations and in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <em>offered</em> before carved images; and be concerned for your endangered  <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and for the unavailing support on which you lean;  and get you a new <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that worships the Maker and not the things which are made&mdash; <em>a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a></em> in which is portrayed the image of verity and of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; believing and being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the triple and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> names. For this is our teaching and our preaching. For the belief of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Christ does not consist of many things.  And those of you as are willing to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to Christ are aware that I have many times repeated my words before you, in order that you might learn and understand what ye hear.</p>

<p>And we ourselves shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in this, like the husbandman who rejoices in the field which is blessed; God also will be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by your repentance towards Him. While you are saved hereby, we also, who give you this counsel, shall not be despoiled of the blessed reward of this work. And, because I am assured that you are a land blessed according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord Christ, therefore, instead of the dust of our feet which we were commanded to shake off against the town that would not receive our words, I have shaken off today at the door of your ears the sayings of my lips, in which are portrayed the coming of Christ which has <em>already</em> been, and also that which is <em>yet</em> to be; and the resurrection, and the resuscitation of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the separation which is to be made between the faithful and the unbelieving; and the sore punishment which is reserved for those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the blessed promise of future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which they shall receive who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ and worshipped Him and His exalted Father, and have confessed Him and His divine Spirit. </p>

<p>And now it is meet for us that I conclude my present discourse; and let those who have accepted the word of Christ remain with us, and those also who are willing to join with us in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and afterwards let them go to their homes.</p>

<p>And Add&aelig;us the apostle was rejoiced to see that a great number of the population of the city stayed with him; and they were <em>but</em> few who did not remain at that time, while even those few not many days after accepted his words and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> set forth in  the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And when Add&aelig;us the apostle had spoken these things before all the town of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">King Abgar</a> saw that all the city rejoiced in his teaching, men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> alike, and <em>heard them</em> saying to him, <q>True and faithful is Christ who sent you to us</q>&mdash; he himself also rejoiced greatly at this, giving praise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because, like as he had heard from Hanan,  his Tabularius, about Christ, so had he seen the wonderful mighty-works which Add&aelig;us the apostle did in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a> also said to him: According as I sent to Christ in my letter to Him, and according as He also sent to me, <em>so</em> have I also received from your own self this day; so will I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> all the days of my life, and in the selfsame things will I continue and make my boast, because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that there is no other power in whose name these signs and wonders are done but the power of Christ whom you preach in verity and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And henceforth Him will I worship&mdash; I and my son Maanu,  and Augustine,  and Shalmath the queen. And now, wherever you desire, build a church, a place of meeting for those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in your words; and, according to the command given you by your Lord, minister at the seasons with confidence; to those also who shall be with you as teachers of this <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> I am prepared to give large donations, in order that they may not have any other work beside the ministry; and whatsoever is required by you for the expenses of the building I myself will give you without any restriction,  while your word shall be authoritative and sovereign in this town; moreover, without <em>the intervention of</em> any other person do you come into my presence as one in authority, into the palace of my royal majesty.</p>

<p>And when <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> had gone down to his royal palace he rejoiced, he and his princes with him, Abdu son of Abdu, and Garmai, and Shemashgram,  and Abubai, and Meherdath,  together with the others their companions, at all that their eyes had seen and their ears also had heard; and in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of their heart they too began to praise God for having turned their mind towards Him, renouncing the paganism in which they had lived,  and confessing the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And when Add&aelig;us had built a church they proceeded to offer in it vows and oblations, they and the people of the city; and there they continued to present their praises all the days of their life.</p>

<p>And Avida and Barcalba,  who were chief men and rulers, and wore the royal headband,  drew near to Add&aelig;us, and asked him about the matter of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <em>requesting</em> that he would tell them how He, though He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, appeared to them as a man: And how, said they, were ye able to look upon Him? And he proceeded to satisfy them all about this, about all that their eyes had seen and about whatsoever their ears had heard from him. Moreover, everything that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> had spoken concerning Him he repeated before them, and they received his words gladly and with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and there was not a man that withstood him; for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which he did suffered not any man to withstand him.</p>

<p>Shavida, moreover, and Ebednebu, chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of this town, together with Piroz  and Dilsu their companions, when they had seen the signs which he did, ran and threw down the altars on which they were accustomed to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> before Nebu and Bel,  their gods, except the great altar which was in the middle of the town; and they cried out and said: Verily this is the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of that eminent and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Master, concerning whom we have heard all that He did in the country of Palestine. And all those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Christ did Add&aelig;us receive, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. And those who used to worship stones and stocks sat at his feet, recovered from the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>  of paganism wherewith they had been afflicted. <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also, traders in fine raiment,  who were familiar with the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash; they too were persuaded, and became <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and confessed Christ that He is the Son of the living God.</p>

<p>But neither did <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">King Abgar</a> nor yet the Apostle Add&aelig;us compel any man by force to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because without the force of man the force of the signs compelled many to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. And with affection did they receive His doctrine&mdash; all this country of Mesopotamia, and all the regions round about it.</p>

<p>Agg&aelig;us, moreover, who  made the silks  and headbands of the king, and Palut, and Barshelama, and Barsamya, together with the others their companions, clave to Add&aelig;us the apostle; and he received them, and associated them with him in the ministry, their business being to read in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> and the New,  and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and in the Acts of the Apostles, <em>and</em> to meditate upon them daily; strictly charging them to let their bodies be pure and their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, as is becoming in men who stand before the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>And be ye,</q> said he, <q>far removed from false swearing and from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> homicide, and from dishonest testimony, which is connected with <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; and from magic arts, for which there is no mercy, and from truth-saying, and <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>, and fortune-tellers; and from <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> and nativities, of which the deluded Chaldeans make their boast; and from the stars, and the signs of the Zodiac, in which the foolish put their trust. And put far from you <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> partiality, and <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, and presents, through which the innocent are pronounced guilty. And along with this ministry, to which you have been called, see that you have no other work besides: for the Lord is the work of your ministry all the days of your life. And be ye diligent to give the seal of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And be not fond of the gains of this world. And hear ye a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And be ye not a stumbling-block to the blind, lest through you should be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the name of Him who opened <em>the eyes of</em> the blind, according as we have seen. Let all, therefore, who see you perceive that you yourselves are in harmony with whatsoever ye preach and teach.</q></p>

<p>And they ministered with him in the church which Add&aelig;us had built at the word and command of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a>, being furnished with supplies by the king and his nobles, partly for the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and partly for the supply of the poor. Moreover, much people day by day assembled and came to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the service, and to <em>the reading of</em> the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, and the New of the Diatessaron.  They also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the restoration of the dead, and buried their departed in the hope of resuscitation. The festivals of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they also observed in their seasons, and were assiduous every day in the <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And they made visits of almsgiving, to the sick and to those that were whole, according to the instruction of Add&aelig;us to them. In the environs, too, of the city churches were built, and many received from him ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.  So that even people of the East, in the guise of merchants, passed over into the territory of the Romans, that they might see the signs which Add&aelig;us did. And such as became <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> received from him ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and in their own country of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> they instructed the people of their nation, and erected houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> there in secret, by reason of the danger from those who worshipped fire and paid reverence to water. </p>

<p>Moreover, Narses, the king of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, when he heard of those same things which Add&aelig;us the apostle had done, sent <em>a message</em> to <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a>: Either dispatch to me the man who does these signs before you, that I may see him and hear his word, or send me <em>an account of</em> all that you have seen him do in your own town. And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> wrote to Narses,  and related to him the whole story of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of Add&aelig;us from the beginning to the end; and he left nothing which he did not write to him. And, when Narses heard those things which were written to him, he was astonished and amazed.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a>, moreover, because he was not able to pass over into the territory of the Romans,  and go to Palestine and slay the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for having crucified Christ, wrote a letter and sent it to <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>,  writing in it thus:&mdash; </p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">King Abgar</a> to our Lord <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>: Although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that nothing is hidden from your Majesty, I write to inform your dread and mighty Sovereignty that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who are under your dominion and dwell in the country of Palestine have assembled themselves together and crucified Christ, without any fault <em>worthy</em> of death, after He had done before them signs and wonders, and had shown them powerful mighty-works, so that He even raised the dead to life for them; and at the time that they crucified Him the sun became darkened and the earth also quaked, and all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things trembled and quaked, and, as if of themselves, at this deed the whole creation and the inhabitants of the creation shrank away. And now your Majesty <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what it is meet for you to command concerning the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who have done these things.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a> wrote and sent to <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">King Abgar</a>; and thus did he write to him:&mdash; </p>

<p>The letter of your Fidelity towards me I have received, and it has been read before me. Concerning what the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have dared to do in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>  the governor also has written and informed Aulbinus  my proconsul concerning these selfsame things of which you have written to me. But, because a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the people of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>,  who have rebelled against me, is on foot at this time, on this account I have not been able to avenge this matter; but I am prepared, when I shall have leisure, to issue a command according to law against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who act not according to law. And on this account, as regards <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> also, who was appointed by me governor there&mdash; I have sent another in his stead, and dismissed him in disgrace, because he departed from the law,  and did the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and for the gratification of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> crucified Christ, who, according to what I hear concerning Him, instead of <em>suffering</em> the cross of death, deserved to be honoured and worshipped  by them: and more especially because with their own eyes they saw everything that He did. Yet you, in accordance with your fidelity towards me, and the faithful covenant <em>entered into by</em> yourself and by your fathers, hast done well in writing to me thus.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a> received Aristides, who had been sent by <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a> to him; and in reply he sent him <em>back</em> with presents of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> suitable for him who had sent him to him. And from <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> he went to Thicuntha,  where Claudius, the second from the emperor, was; and from thence, again, he went to Artica,  where <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a> was: Caius, moreover, was guarding the regions round about C&aelig;sar. And Aristides himself also related before <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> concerning the mighty-works which Add&aelig;us had done before <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a>. And when he had leisure from the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> he sent and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> some of the chief men of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were in Palestine. And, when <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a> heard of this, he rejoiced greatly that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had received punishment, as it was right.</p>

<p>And some years after Add&aelig;us the apostle had built the church in <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, and had furnished it with everything that was suitable for it, and had made <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of a great number of the population of the city, he further built churches in the villages  also&mdash; <em>both</em> those which were at a distance and those which were near, and finished and adorned them, and appointed in them <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and elders, and instructed in them those who should read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and taught the ordinances and  the ministry without and within.</p>

<p>After all these things he fell ill of the sickness of which he departed from this world. And he called for Agg&aelig;us before the whole assembly of the church, and bade him draw near, and made him Guide and Ruler  in his stead. And Palut,  who was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he made elder; and Abshelama, who was a scribe, he made <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. And, the nobles and chief men being assembled, and standing near him&mdash; Barcalba son of Zati,  and Maryhab  son of Barshemash, and Senac  son of Avida, and Piroz son of Patric,  together with the rest of their companions&mdash; Add&aelig;us the apostle said to them:&mdash; </p>

<p>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and are <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, all of you who hear me, that, <em>according to</em> all that I have preached to you and taught you and you have heard from me, even so have I behaved myself in the midst of you, and you have seen <em>it</em> in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> also: because our Lord thus charged us, that, whatsoever we preach in words before the people, we should practise it in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> before all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And, <em>do</em> also according to the ordinances and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which were appointed by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in Jerusalem,  and by which my fellow <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also guided their conduct &mdash; turn not aside from them, nor diminish anything from them: even as I also am guided by them among you, and have not turned aside from them to the right hand or to the left, lest I should become estranged from the promised <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is reserved for such as are guided by them.</p>

<p>Give  heed, therefore, to this ministry which you hold, and with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling continue in it, and minister every day. Minister not in it with neglectful habits, but with the discreetness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and let not the praises of Christ cease out of your mouth, nor let weariness of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> at the <em>stated</em> times come upon you. Give heed to the verity which you hold, and to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which you have received, and to the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which I commit to you: because before the tribunal of Christ will you have to give an account of it, when He makes reckoning with the shepherds and overseers, and when He takes His money from the traders with the addition of the gains. For He is the Son of a King, and goes to receive a kingdom and return; and He will come and make a resuscitation <em>to life</em> for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and then will He sit upon the throne of His righteousness, and judge the dead and the living, as He said to us.</p>

<p>Let not the secret eye of your minds be closed by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, lest your stumbling-blocks be many in the way in which there are no stumbling-blocks, but a hateful  wandering in its paths. Seek ye those that are lost, and direct those that go astray, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in those that are found; bind up the bruised, and watch over the fatlings: because at your hands will the sheep of Christ be required. Look ye not for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that passes away: for the shepherd that looks to receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from his flock&mdash; sadly, sadly stands his flock with respect to him. Let your concern be great for the young lambs, whose <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> behold the face of the Father who is unseen. And be ye not stones of stumbling before the blind, but clearers of the way and the paths in a rugged country, among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the crucifiers, and the deluded <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>: for with these two parties have ye to fight, in order that you may show the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which you hold; and, though ye be silent, your modest and decorous appearance will fight for you against those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<p>Buffet not the poor in the presence of the rich: for scourge grievous enough for them is their poverty.</p>

<p><q>Be not beguiled by the hateful devices of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, lest ye be stripped naked of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which you have put on.</q>. ..<q>And with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the crucifiers, we will have no fellowship. And this inheritance which we have received from you we will not let go, but in that will we depart out of this world; and on the day of our Lord, before the judgment-seat of His righteousness, there will He restore to us this inheritance, even as you have told us.</q></p>

<p>And, when these things had been spoken, <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a> rose up, he and his chief men and his nobles, and he went to his palace, all of them being distressed for him because he was dying. And he sent to him noble and excellent apparel, that he might be buried in it. And, when Add&aelig;us saw it, he sent to him, <em>saying:</em> In my lifetime I have not taken anything from you, nor will I now at my death take anything from you, nor will I frustrate the word of Christ which He spoke to us: Accept not anything from any man, and possess not anything in this world. </p>

<p>And three days more after these things had been spoken by Add&aelig;us the apostle, and he had heard and received the testimony concerning the teaching set forth in their preaching from those engaged with him in the ministry, in the presence of all the nobles he departed out of this world. And that day was the fifth of the week, and the fourteenth of the month Iyar,  <em>nearly answering to May</em>. And the whole city was in great mourning and bitter anguish for him. Nor was it the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> only that were distressed for him, but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also, and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, who were in this same town. But <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a> was distressed for him more than any one, he and the princes of his kingdom. And in the sadness of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> he despised and laid aside the magnificence of his kingly state on that day, and with tears mingled with moans he bewailed him with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. And all the people of the city that saw him were amazed <em>to see</em> how greatly he suffered on his account. And with great and surpassing pomp he bore <em>him</em>, and buried him like one of the princes when he dies; and he laid him in a grand sepulchre adorned with sculpture wrought by the fingers&mdash; that in which were laid those of the house of Ariu, the ancestors of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a>: there he laid him sorrowfully, with sadness and great distress. And all the people of the church went there from time to time and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> fervently; and they kept up the remembrance of his departure from year to year, according to the command and direction which had been received by them from Add&aelig;us the apostle,  and according to the word of Agg&aelig;us, who himself became Guide and Ruler, and the successor of his seat after him, by the ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> which he had received from him in the presence of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p>He too, with the same ordination which he had received from him, made Priests and Guides in the whole of this country of Mesopotamia. For they also, in like manner as Add&aelig;us the apostle, held fast his word, and listened to and received <em>it</em>, as good and faithful successors of the apostle of the adorable Christ. But silver and gold he took not from any man, nor did the gifts of the princes come near him: for, instead of <em>receiving</em> gold and silver, he <em>himself</em> enriched the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, <em>as regards</em> the entire state  of the men and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, they were chaste and circumspect, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and pure: for they lived like <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>  and chastely, without spot&mdash; in circumspect watchfulness touching the ministry, in their sympathy  toward the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, in their visitations to the sick: for their footsteps were fraught with praise from those who saw <em>them</em>, and their conduct was arrayed in commendation from strangers&mdash; so that even the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the house of  Nebu and Bel divided the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with them at all times, by reason of their dignified aspect, their truthful words, their frankness of speech arising from their noble nature, which was neither subservient through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> nor in bondage under <em>the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of</em> blame. For there was no one who saw them that did not run to meet them, that he might salute them respectfully, because the very sight of them shed peace upon the beholden: for just like a net  were their words of gentleness spread over the contumacious, and they entered within the fold of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and verity. For there was no man who saw them that was ashamed of them, because they did nothing that was not accordant with rectitude and propriety. And in consequence of these things their bearing was fearless as they published their teaching to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For, whatsoever they said to others and enjoined on them, they themselves exhibited in practice in their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; and the hearers, who saw that their actions went along with their words, without much persuasion became their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and confessed the King Christ, praising God for having turned them towards Him.</p>

<p>And some years after the death of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a>, there arose one of his contumacious  sons, who was not favourable to peace; and he sent <em>word</em> to Agg&aelig;us, as he was sitting in the church: Make me a headband of gold, such as you used to make for my fathers in former times. Agg&aelig;us sent to him: I will not give up the ministry of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was committed to me by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and make a headband of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And, when he saw that he did not comply, he sent and broke his legs  as he was sitting in the church expounding. And as he was dying he adjured Palut and Abshelama: In this house, for whose <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> sake, lo! I am dying, lay me and bury me. And, even as he had adjured <em>them</em>, so did they lay him&mdash; inside the middle door of the church, between the men and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. And there was great and bitter mourning in all the church, and in all the city&mdash; over and above the anguish and the mourning which there had been within <em>the church</em>, such as had been the mourning when Add&aelig;us the apostle himself died.</p>

<p>And,  in consequence of his dying suddenly and quickly at the breaking of his legs, he was not able to lay <em>his</em> hand upon Palut. Palut went to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and received ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Serapion <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; by which Serapion himself also ordination had been received from <a href="../cathen/15756c.htm">Zephyrinus</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in the succession of the ordination to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from Simon Cephas, who had received <em>it</em> from our Lord, and was <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> there in Rome twenty-five years in the days of the C&aelig;sar who reigned there thirteen years.</p>

<p>And, according to the custom which exists in the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar the king</a>, and in all kingdoms, that whatsoever the king commands and whatsoever is spoken in his presence is committed to writing and deposited among the records, so also did Labubna,  son of Senac, son of Ebedshaddai, the king's scribe, write these things also relating to Add&aelig;us the apostle from the beginning to the end, while Hanan also the Tabularius, a sharir of the kings, set-to his hand in <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and deposited <em>the writing</em> among the records of the kings, where the ordinances and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are deposited, and where <em>the contracts of</em> the buyers and sellers are kept with care, without any negligence whatever.</p>

<p> <em>Here</em> ends the teaching of Add&aelig;us the apostle, which he proclaimed in <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, the faithful city of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a>, the faithful king.</p>

<p><span class="sc">A Note by the Translator.</span> &mdash; The following list of the Syrian names of months, in use in the empire and during the era of the Seleucid&aelig;, several of which have been mentioned in these Documents, is taken from <em>Caswinii Calendarium Syriacum</em>, edited in Arabic and Latin by Volck, 1859. The later Hebrew names also are here added for comparison. It must, however, be noticed that "the years employed <em>in the Syrian Calendar</em>, were, at least after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, Julian years, composed of Roman months." (See <em><span lang="FR">L'Art de v&eacute;rifier les dates:</span> </em> Paris, 1818, tom. i. p. 45.) The correspondence with the Hebrew months, therefore, is not so close as the names would indicate, since these commenced with the new moons, and an intercalary month, Veadar, following their twelfth month Adar, was added.

<p><span class="sc">Month / Syrian / Hebrew</span> </p>
