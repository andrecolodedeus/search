<h1>Gospel of Nicodemus (Part II, Greek Form)</h1>

<p><strong>The Descent of Christ into Hell.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1 (17).</h2>

<p>Joseph says: And why do you wonder that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has risen? But it is wonderful that He has not risen alone, but that He has also raised many others of the dead who have appeared in Jerusalem to many. <span class="stiki" id="note081930"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse53">Matthew&nbsp;27:53</a></span> And if you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the others, Symeon at least, who received Jesus, and his two sons whom He has raised up&mdash; them at least you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For we buried them not long ago; but now their tombs are seen open <em>and</em> empty, and they are alive, and dwelling in Arimath&aelig;a. They therefore sent men, and they found their tombs open and empty. Joseph says: Let us go to Arimath&aelig;a and find them.</p>

<p>Then rose up the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, and Joseph, and <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>, and others with them, and went away to Arimath&aelig;a, and found those whom Joseph spoke of. They made <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, therefore, and saluted each other. Then they came with them to Jerusalem, and brought them into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and secured the doors, and placed in the midst the old <em>covenant</em> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> said to them: We wish you to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and Adonai, and so that you tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, how you have risen, and who has raised you from the dead.</p>

<p>The men who had risen having heard this, made upon their faces the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and said to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: Give us paper and ink and pen. These therefore they brought. And sitting down, they wrote thus:&mdash; </p>

<h2>Chapter 2 (18).</h2>

<p>O <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the resurrection and the life of the world, grant us <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that we may give an account of Your resurrection, and Your <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which You did in Hades. We then were in Hades, with all who had fallen asleep since the beginning of the world. And at the hour of midnight there rose a light as if of the sun, and shone into these dark <em>regions;</em> and we were all lighted up, and saw each other. And straightway our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was united with the patriarchs and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and at the same time they were filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and said to each other: This light is from a great source of light. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Hesaias, who was there present, said: This light is from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; about whom I prophesied when yet alive, saying, The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, the people that sat in darkness, have seen a great light. <span class="stiki" id="note081931"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;9:1-2</a></span> </p>

<p>Then there came into the midst another, an <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>; and the patriarchs said to him: Who are you? And he said: I am John, the last of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who made the paths of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> straight, <span class="stiki" id="note081932"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;3:3</a></span> and proclaimed to the people repentance for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note081933"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse4">Mark&nbsp;1:4</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> came to me; and I, seeing Him a long way off, said to the people: Behold the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world. <span class="stiki" id="note081934"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> And with my hand I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Him in the river Jordan, and I saw like a dove also the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> coming upon Him;  and I heard also the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,  thus saying: This is my beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased. <span class="stiki" id="note081937"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;3:22</a></span> And on this account He sent me also to you, to proclaim how the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is coming here, that whosoever shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him shall be saved, and whosoever shall not believe in Him shall be condemned.  On this account I say to you all, in order that when you see Him you all may adore Him, that now only is for you the time of repentance for having adored <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> in the vain upper world, and for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you have committed, and that this is impossible at any other time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3 (19).</h2>

<p>While John, therefore, was thus teaching those in Hades, the first created and forefather <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> heard, and said to his son Seth: My son, I wish you to tell the forefathers of the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> where I sent you, when it fell to my lot to die. And Seth said: Prophets and patriarchs, hear. When my father Adam, the first created, was about to fall once upon a time into death, he sent me to make entreaty to God very close by the gate of paradise, that He would guide me by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to the tree of compassion and that I might take oil and anoint my father, and that he might rise up from his sickness: which thing, therefore, I also did. And after the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord came, and said to me: What, Seth, do you ask? Do you ask oil which raises up the sick, or the tree from which this oil flows, on account of the sickness of your father? This is not to be found now. Go, therefore, and tell your father, that after the accomplishing of five thousand five hundred years  from the creation of the world, then shall come into the earth the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, being made man; and He shall anoint him with this oil, and shall raise him up; and shall wash clean, with water and with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, both him and those out of him, and then shall he be healed of every disease; but now this is impossible. </p>

<p>When the patriarchs and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> heard these words, they rejoiced greatly.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4 (20).</h2>

<p>And when all were in such <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, came <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> the heir of darkness, and said to Hades: O all-devouring and insatiable, hear my words. There is of the race of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> one named Jesus, calling himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by our working with them the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have crucified him: and now when he is dead, be ready that we may secure him here. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and I heard him also saying, My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death. <span class="stiki" id="note081941"><a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse34">Mark&nbsp;15:34</a></span> He has also done me many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> when living with mortals in the upper world. For wherever he found my servants, he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them; and whatever men I made crooked, blind, lame, <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, or any such thing, by a single word he healed them; and many whom I had got ready to be buried, even these through a single word he brought to life again.</p>

<p>Hades says: And is this <em>man</em> so powerful as to do such things by a single word? Or if he be so, can you withstand him? It seems to me that, if he be so, no one will be able to withstand him. And if you say that you heard him dreading death, he said this mocking you, and laughing, wishing to seize you with the strong hand; and woe, woe to you, to all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>!</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> says: O all-devouring and insatiable Hades, are you so afraid at hearing of our common enemy? I was not afraid of him, but worked in the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and they crucified him, and gave him also to drink gall with vinegar. <span class="stiki" id="note081942"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;27:34</a></span> Make ready, then, in order that you may lay fast hold of him when he comes.</p>

<p>Hades answered: Heir of darkness, son of destruction, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, you have just now told me that many whom you had made ready to be buried, be brought to life again by a single word. And if he has delivered others from the tomb, how and with what power shall he be laid hold of by us? For I not long ago swallowed down one dead, Lazarus by name; and not long after, one of the living by a single word dragged him up by force out of my bowels: and I think that it was he of whom you speak. If, therefore, we receive him here, I am afraid lest perchance we be in danger even about the rest. For, lo, all those that I have swallowed from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> I perceive to be in commotion, and I am pained in my belly. And the snatching away of Lazarus beforehand seems to me to be no good sign: for not like a dead body, but like an eagle, he flew out of me; for so suddenly did the earth throw him out. Wherefore also I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> even you, for your benefit and for mine, not to bring him here; for I think that he is coming here to raise all the dead. And this I tell you: by the darkness in which we live, if you bring him here, not one of the dead will be left behind in it to me.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5 (21).</h2>

<p>While <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> and Hades were thus speaking to each other, there was a great voice like thunder, saying: Lift up your gates, O you rulers; and be lifted up, you everlasting gates; and the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> shall come in.  When Hades heard, he said to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>: Go forth, if you are able, and withstand him. <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> therefore went forth to the outside. Then Hades says to his <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>: Secure well and strongly the gates of brass and the bars of iron, and attend to my bolts, and stand in order,  and see to everything; for if he come in here, woe will seize us.</p>

<p>The forefathers having heard this, began all to revile him, saying: O all-devouring and insatiable! Open, that the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may come in. David the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O blind, that I when living in the world prophesied this saying: Lift up your gates, O you rulers? Hesaias said: I, foreseeing this by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, wrote: The dead shall rise up, and those in their tombs shall be raised, and those in the earth shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.  And where, O death, is your sting? Where, O Hades, is your victory? <span class="stiki" id="note081946"><a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse14">Hosea&nbsp;13:14</a></span> </p>

<p>There came, then, again a voice saying: Lift up the gates. Hades, hearing the voice the second time, answered as if forsooth he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and says: Who is this King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of the Lord say: The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.  And immediately with these words the brazen gates were shattered, and the iron bars broken, and all the dead who had been bound came out of the prisons, and we with them. And the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> came in in the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and all the dark places of Hades were lighted up.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6 (22).</h2>

<p>Immediately Hades cried out: We have been conquered: woe to us! But who are you, that hast such power and might? And what are you, who comest here without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> who art seen to be small and yet of great power, lowly and exalted, the slave and the master, the soldier and the king, who hast power over the dead and the living? You were nailed on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and placed in the tomb; and now you are free, and hast destroyed all our power. Are you then the Jesus about whom the chief satrap <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> told us, that through cross and death you are to inherit the whole world?</p>

<p>Then the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> seized the chief satrap <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> by the head, and delivered him to His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and said: With iron chains bind his hands and his feet, and his neck, and his mouth. Then He delivered him to Hades, and said: Take him, and keep him secure till my second appearing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7 (23).</h2>

<p>And Hades receiving <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, said to him: Beelzebul, heir of fire and punishment, enemy of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, through what necessity did you bring about that the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should be crucified, so that he should come here and deprive us <em>of our power?</em> Turn and see that not one of the dead has been left in me, but all that you have gained through the tree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, all have you lost through the tree of the cross: and all your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> has been turned into grief; and wishing to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, you have put yourself to death. For, since I have received you to keep you safe, by experience shall you learn how many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> I shall do unto you. O arch-<a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the beginning of death, root of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, end of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> did you find in Jesus, that you should compass his destruction? How have you dared to do such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? How have you busied yourself to bring down such a man into this darkness, through whom you have been deprived of all who have died from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8 (24).</h2>

<p>While Hades was thus discoursing to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, the King of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> stretched out His right hand, and took hold of our forefather Adam, and raised him. Then turning also to the rest, He said: Come all with me, as many as have died through the tree which he touched: for, behold, I again raise you all up through the tree of the cross. Thereupon He brought them all out, and our forefather <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> seemed to be filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and said: I thank Your majesty, O Lord, that You have brought me up out of the lowest Hades.  Likewise also all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> said: We thank You, O Christ, Saviour of the world, that You have brought our life up out of destruction. </p>

<p>And after they had thus spoken, the Saviour blessed <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> on his forehead, and did this also to the patriarchs, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and forefathers; and He took them, and sprang up out of Hades. And while He was going, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers accompanying Him sang praises, saying: Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord:  <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>; to Him be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9 (25).</h2>

<p>And setting out to paradise, He took hold of our forefather <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by the hand, and delivered him, and all the just, to the archangel Michael. And as they were going into the door of paradise, there met them two old men, to whom the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers said: Who are you, who have not seen death, and have not come down into Hades, but who dwell in paradise in your bodies and your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>? One of them answered, and said: I am <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, who was well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and who was translated hither by Him; and this is Helias the Thesbite; and we are also to live until the end of the world; and then we are to be sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to withstand <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, and to be slain by him, and after three days to rise again, and to be snatched up in clouds to meet the Lord. </p>

<h2>Chapter 10 (26).</h2>

<p>While they were thus speaking, there came another lowly man, carrying  also upon his shoulders a cross, to whom the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers said: Who are you, who hast the look of a robber; and what is the cross which you bear upon your shoulders? He answered: I, as you say, was a robber and a thief in the world, and for these things the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> laid hold of me, and delivered me to the death of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, along with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. While, then, He was hanging upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, I, seeing the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that were done, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him, and entreated Him, and said, Lord, when You shall be King, do not forget me. And immediately He said to me, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>: today, I say unto you, shall you be with me in paradise. Therefore I came to paradise carrying my cross; and finding the archangel Michael, I said to him, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus</a>, who has been crucified, has sent me here; bring me, therefore, to the gate of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>. And the flaming sword, seeing the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, opened to me, and I went in. Then the archangel says to me, Wait a little, for there comes also the forefather of the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, Adam, with the just, that they too may come in. And now, seeing you, I came to meet you.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> hearing these things, all cried out with a loud voice: Great is our Lord, and great is His strength. </p>

<h2>Chapter 11 (27).</h2>

<p>All these things we saw and heard; we, the two brothers, who also have been sent by Michael the archangel, and have been ordered to proclaim the resurrection of the Lord, but first to go away to the Jordan and to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Thither also we have gone, and have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the rest of the dead who have risen. Thereafter also we came to Jerusalem, and celebrated the passover of the resurrection. But now we are going away, being unable to stay here.
