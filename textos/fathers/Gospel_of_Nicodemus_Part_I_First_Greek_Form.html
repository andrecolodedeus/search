<h1>Gospel of Nicodemus (Part I, First Greek Form)</h1>

<p><strong>Memorials of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Done in the Time of Pontius Pilate.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Prologue.</span> &mdash; I Ananias, of the propr&aelig;tor's bodyguard, being learned in the law, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, coming to Him by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and counted worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, searching also the memorials written at that time of what was done in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had laid up in the time of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, found these memorials written in Hebrew, and by the favour of God have translated them into Greek for the information of all who call upon the name of our Master <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, in the seventeenth year of the reign of our Lord Flavius Theodosius, and the sixth of Flavius Valentinianus, in the ninth indiction. </p>

<p>All you, therefore, who read and transfer into other books, remember me, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me, that God may be merciful to me, and pardon my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against Him.</p>

<p>Peace be to those who read, and to those who hear and to their households. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth year  of the government of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>, emperor of the Romans, and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> being king of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, in the nineteenth year of his rule, on the eighth day before the Kalends of April, which is the twenty-fifth of March, in the consulship of Rufus and Rubellio, in the fourth year of the two hundred and second Olympiad, Joseph <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> being <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>The account that <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> wrote in Hebrew, after the cross and passion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Saviour <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and left to those that came after him, is as follows:&mdash; </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p>Having called a council, the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> and Semes and Dathaes, and <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>, Judas, Levi and Nephthalim, Alexander and Ja&iuml;rus,  and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> accusing Jesus about many things, saying: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this man to be the son of Joseph the carpenter, born of Mary; and he says that he is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and a king; moreover, he profanes the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and wishes to do away with the law of our fathers. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: And what are the things which he does, to show that he wishes to do away with it?  The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: We have a law not to cure any one on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>; but this man  has on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> cured the lame and the crooked, the withered and the blind and the paralytic, the dumb and the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a>, by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> practices. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: What <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> practices? They say to him: He is a magician, and by Beelzebul prince of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> he casts out the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and all are subject to him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: This is not casting out the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by an unclean spirit, but by the god &AElig;sculapius.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: we entreat your highness that he stand at your tribunal, and be heard.  And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> having called them, says: Tell me how I, being a <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, can try a king? They say to him: We do not say that he is a king, but he himself says that he is. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> having called the runner, says to him: Let Jesus be brought in with respect. And the runner going out, and recognising Him, adored Him, and took his cloak into his hand, and spread it on the ground, and says to him: My lord, walk on this, and come in, for the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> calls you. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> seeing what the runner had done, cried out against <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, saying: Why have you ordered him to come in by a runner, and not by a crier? For assuredly the runner, when he saw him, adored him, and spread his doublet on the ground, and made him walk like a king.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> having called the runner, says to him: Why have you done this, and spread out your cloak upon the earth, and made Jesus walk upon it? The runner says to him: My lord <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, when you sent me to Jerusalem to Alexander,  I saw him sitting upon an ass, and the sons of the Hebrews held branches in their hands, and shouted; and other spread their clothes under him saying, Save now, you who are in the highest: blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note081809"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;21:8-9</a></span> </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cry out, and say to the runner: The sons of the Hebrews shouted in Hebrew; whence then have you the Greek? The runner says to them: I asked one of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and said, What is it they are shouting in Hebrew? And he interpreted it for me. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: And what did they shout in Hebrew? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: <span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> membrome Baruchamma Adona&iuml;</span> .  <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: And this hosanna, etc., how is it interpreted? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: Save now in the highest; blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: If you bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the words spoken by the children, in what has the runner done wrong? And they were silent. And the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> says to the runner: Go out, and bring him in what way you will. And the runner going out, did in the same manner as before, and says to Jesus: My lord, come in; the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> calls you.</p>

<p>And Jesus going in, and the standard-bearers holding their standards, the tops of the standards were bent down, and adored Jesus. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> seeing the bearing of the standards, how they were bent down and adored Jesus, cried  out vehemently against the standard-bearers. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Do you not wonder how the tops of the standards were bent down, and adored Jesus? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We saw how the standard-bearers bent them down, and adored him. And the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> having called the standard-bearers, says to them: Why have you done this? They say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We are Greeks and temple-slaves, and how could we adore him? And assuredly, as we were holding them up, the tops bent down of their own accord, and adored him.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and the elders of the people: Do you choose for yourselves men strong and powerful, and let them hold up the standards, and let us see whether they will bend down with them. And the elders of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> picked out twelve men powerful and strong, and made them hold up the standards six by six; and they were placed in front of the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator's</a> tribunal. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the runner: Take him outside of the pr&aelig;torium, and bring him in again in whatever way may please you. And Jesus and the runner went out of the pr&aelig;torium. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, summoning those who had formerly held up the standards, says to them: I have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> by the health of C&aelig;sar, that if the standards do not bend down when Jesus comes in, I will cut off your heads. And the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> ordered Jesus to come in the second time. And the runner did in the same manner as before, and made many entreaties to Jesus to walk on his cloak. And He walked on it, and went in. And as He went in, the standards were again bent down, and adored Jesus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> seeing this, was afraid, and sought to go away from the tribunal; but when he was still thinking of going away, his wife sent to him, saying: Have nothing to do with this just man, for many things have I suffered on his account this night. <span class="stiki" id="note081812"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;27:19</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, summoning the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, says to them: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my wife is a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and prefers to adhere to the Jewish religion along with you. They say to him: Yes; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: Behold, my wife  has sent to me, saying, Have nothing to do with this just man, for many things have I suffered on account of him this night. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answering, say unto <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Did we not tell you that he was a sorcerer?  behold, he has sent a dream to your wife.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, having summoned Jesus, says to Him: What do these <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against you? Do you say nothing? And Jesus said: Unless they had the power, they would say nothing; for every one has the power of his own mouth to speak both good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. They shall see to it. </p>

<p>And the elders of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered, and said to Jesus: What shall we see? First, that you were born of fornication; secondly, that your birth in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of the infants; thirdly, that your father Joseph and your mother Mary fled into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> because they had no confidence in the people.</p>

<p>Some of the bystanders, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, say: we deny that he was born of fornication; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Joseph espoused Mary, and he was not born of fornication. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who said that he was of fornication: This story of yours is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, because they were <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, as also these fellow-countrymen of yours say. <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: All the multitude of us cry out that he was born of fornication, and are not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; these are proselytes, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, says to them: What are proselytes? They say to him: They are by birth children of the Greeks, and have now become <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And those that said that He was not born of fornication, viz.&mdash; Lazarus, Asterius, Antonius, James, Amnes, Zeras, Samuel, Isaac, Phinees, Crispus, Agrippas, and Judas &mdash; say: We are not proselytes, but are children of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and speak of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for we were present at the betrothal of <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a>.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling these twelve men who said that He was not born of fornication, says to them: I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you by the health of C&aelig;sar, to tell me whether it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that you say, that he was not born of fornication. They say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We have a law against taking oaths, because it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but they will <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the health of C&aelig;sar,  that it is not as we have said, and we are liable to death. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>: Have you nothing to answer to this? <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: These twelve are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> when they say that he was not born of fornication; all the multitude of us cry out that he was born of fornication, and that he is a sorcerer, and he says that he is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and a king, and we are not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> orders all the multitude to go out, except the twelve men who said that He was not born of fornication, and he ordered Jesus to be separated from them. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: For what reason do they wish to put him to death? They say to him: They are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> because he cures on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: For a good work do they wish to put him to death? They say to him: Yes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, filled with rage, went outside of the pr&aelig;torium, and said to them: I take the sun to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>  that I find no fault in this man. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered and said to the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>: Unless this man were an evil-doer, we should not have delivered him to you. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said, Do you take him, and judge him according to your law. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: It is not lawful for us to put any one to death. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: Has God said that you are not to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, but that I am?</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> went again into the pr&aelig;torium, and spoke to Jesus privately, and said to Him: Are you the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Jesus answered <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Do you say this of yourself, or have others said it to you of me? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered Jesus: Am I also a Jew?  Your nation and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have given you up to me. What have you done? Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world; for if my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight in order that I should not be given up to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: but now my kingdom is not from thence. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said to Him: Are you then a king? Jesus answered him: You say that I am a king. Because for this have I been born, and have I come, in order that every one who is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might hear my voice. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to him: What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Jesus says to him: Truth is from heaven. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: Is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> not upon earth? Jesus says to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: You see how those who speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are judged by those that have the power upon earth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p>And leaving Jesus within the pr&aelig;torium, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> went out to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and said to them: I find no fault in him. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: He said, I can destroy this temple, and in three days build it. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: What temple? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: The one that Solomon <span class="stiki" id="note081820"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;2:20</a></span> built in forty-six years, and this man speaks of pulling it down and building it in three days. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: I am innocent of the blood of this just man. See you to it. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: His blood be upon us, and upon our children.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> having summoned the elders and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, said to them privately: Do not act thus, because no charge that you bring against him is worthy of death; for your charge is about curing and <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> profanation. The elders and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> say: If any one speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against C&aelig;sar, is he worthy of death or not? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: He is worthy of death. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: If any one speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against C&aelig;sar, he is worthy of death; but this man has spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against God.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> ordered the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to go outside of the pr&aelig;torium; and summoning Jesus, he says to Him: What shall I do to you? Jesus says to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: As it has been given to you. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: How given? Jesus says: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have proclaimed beforehand of my death and resurrection. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> noticing this, and hearing it, say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: What more will you hear of this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: If these words be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>, do you take him for the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, and lead him away to your <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and judge him according to your law. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Our law bears that a man who wrongs his fellow-men is worthy to receive forty save one; but he that blasphemes God is to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> with stones. </p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: Do you take him, and punish him in whatever way you please. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We wish that he be crucified. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: He is not deserving of crucifixion.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, looking round upon the crowds of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> standing by, sees many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> weeping, and says: All the multitude do not wish him to die. The elders of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: For this reason all the multitude of us have come, that he should die. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Why should he die? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: Because he called himself <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and King.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p>And one <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, a Jew, stood before the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, and said: I beseech your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, let me say a few words. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: Say on. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says: I said to the elders and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and to all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, What do you seek to do with this man? This man does many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and strange things, which no one has done or will do. Let him go, and do not wish any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against him. If the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which he does are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they will stand; but if man, they will come to nothing. <span class="stiki" id="note081822"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;5:38</a></span> For assuredly <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, being sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, did many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, which the Lord commanded him to do before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And there were there Jannes and Jambres, servants of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, and they also did not a few of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did; and the Egyptians took them to be gods&mdash; this Jannes and this Jambres. <span class="stiki" id="note081823"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:8-9</a></span> But, since the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which they did were not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both they and those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in them were destroyed. And now release this man, for he is not deserving of death.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>: You have become his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and therefore you defend him. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says to them: Perhaps, too, the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> has become his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, because he defends him. Has the emperor not appointed him to this place of dignity? And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were vehemently enraged, and gnashed their teeth against <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: Why do you gnash your teeth against him when you hear the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>: Mayst you receive his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and his portion. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>; may I receive it, as you have said.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p>One of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, stepping up, asked leave of the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> to say a word. The <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> says: If you wish to say any thing, say on. And the Jew said: Thirty-eight years I lay in my bed in great agony. And when Jesus came, many <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>, and many lying ill of various diseases, were cured by him. And some young men, taking pity on me, carried me, bed and all, and took me to him. And when Jesus saw me, he had compassion on me, and said to me: Take up your couch and walk. And I took up my couch, and walked. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Ask him on what day it was that he was cured. He that had been cured says: On a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note081824"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;5:5-9</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: Is not this the very thing that we said, that on a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> he cures and casts out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>?</p>

<p>And another Jew stepped up and said: I was born blind; I heard sounds, but saw not a face. And as Jesus passed by, I cried out with a loud voice, Pity me, O son of David. And he pitied me, and put his hands upon my eyes, and I instantly received my sight.  And another Jew stepped up and said: I was crooked, and he straightened me with a word. And another said: I was a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, and he cured me with a word. </p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p>And a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>  cried out from a distance, and said: I had an issue of blood, and I touched the hem of his garment, and the issue of blood which I had had for twelve years was stopped. <span class="stiki" id="note081828"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;9:20-26</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: we have a law, that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> evidence is not to be received. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p>And others, a multitude both of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, cried out, saying: This man is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are subject to him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them who said that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were subject to Him: Why, then, were not your teachers also subject to him? They say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And others said: He raised Lazarus from the tomb after he had been dead four days. <span class="stiki" id="note081830"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;11:1-16</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> trembled, and said to all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Why do you wish to pour out innocent blood?</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p>And having summoned <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> and the twelve men that said He was not born of fornication, he says to them: What shall I do, because there is an insurrection among the people? They say to him: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; let them see to it. Again <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, having summoned all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, says: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is customary, at the feast of unleavened bread, to release one prisoner to you. I have one condemned prisoner in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, a murderer named Barabbas, and this man standing in your presence, Jesus, in whom I find no fault. Which of them do you wish me to release to you? And they cry out: Barabbas. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: What, then, shall we do to Jesus who is called Christ? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: Let him be crucified. And others said: You are no friend of C&aelig;sar's if you release this man, because he called himself <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and king. You wish, then, this man to be king, and not C&aelig;sar? </p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, in a rage, says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Always has your nation been rebellious, and you always speak against your benefactors. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: What benefactors? He says to them: Your God led you out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> from bitter slavery, and brought you safe through the sea as through dry land, and in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> fed you with manna, and gave you quails, and quenched your thirst with water from a rock, and gave you a law; and in all these things you provoked your God to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and sought a molten calf. And you exasperated your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He sought to slay you. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for you, and you were not <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. And now you charge me with hating the emperor. </p>

<p>And rising up from the tribunal, he sought to go out. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cry out, and say: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that C&aelig;sar is king, and not Jesus. For assuredly the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> brought gifts to him as to a king. And when <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> heard from the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> that a king had been born, he sought to slay him; and his father Joseph, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, took him and his mother, and they fled into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> hearing of it, destroyed the children of the Hebrews that had been born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. </p>

<p>And when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> heard these words, he was afraid; and ordering the crowd to keep silence, because they were crying out, he said to them: So this is he whom <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> sought? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: Yes, it is he. And, taking water, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> washed his hands in the face of the sun, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; see you to it. Again the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cry out: His blood be upon us, and upon our children.</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> ordered the curtain of the tribunal where he was sitting to be drawn,  and says to Jesus: Your nation has charged you with being a king. On this account I sentence you, first to be scourged, according to the enactment of venerable kings, and then to be fastened on the cross in the garden where you were seized. And let Dysmas and Gestas, the two malefactors, be crucified with you.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>And Jesus went forth out of the pr&aelig;torium, and the two malefactors with Him. And when they came to the place, they stripped Him of his clothes, and girded Him with a towel, and put a crown of thorns on Him round His head. And they crucified Him; and at the same time also they hung up the two malefactors along with Him. And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do. And the soldiers parted His clothes among them; and the people stood looking at Him. And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the rulers with them, mocked Him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself. If he be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, let him come down from the cross. And the soldiers made sport of Him, coming near and offering Him vinegar mixed with gall, and said: You are the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; save yourself. </p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, after the sentence, ordered the charge made against Him to be inscribed as a superscription in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, according to what the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had said: He is king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>And one of the malefactors hanging up spoke to Him, saying: If you are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, save yourself and us. And Dysmas answering, reproved him, saying: Do you not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because you are in the same condemnation? And we indeed <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, for we receive the fit punishment of our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; but this man has done no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And he said to Jesus: Remember me, Lord, in Your kingdom. And Jesus said to him: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>; I say to you, Today shall you be  with me in Paradise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the earth until the ninth hour, the sun being darkened; and the curtain of the temple was split in the middle. And crying out with a loud voice, Jesus said: Father, Baddach ephkid ruel, which is, interpreted: Into Your hands I commit my spirit.  And having said this, He gave up the ghost. And the centurion, seeing what had happened, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said: This was a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man. And all the crowds that were present at this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, beat their breasts and went away.</p>

<p>And the centurion reported what had happened to the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>. And when the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> and his wife heard it, they were exceedingly grieved, and neither ate nor drank that day. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> sent for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and said to them: Have you seen what has happened? And they say: There has been an eclipse of the sun in the usual way. </p>

<p>And His acquaintances were standing at a distance, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who came with Him from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, seeing these things. And a man named Joseph, a councillor from the city of Arimath&aelig;a, who also waited for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and begged the body of Jesus. And he took it down, and wrapped it in clean linen, and placed it in a tomb hewn out of the rock, in which no one had ever lain.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, hearing that Joseph had begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, sought him and the twelve who said that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not born of fornication, and <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, and many others who had stepped up before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and declared His good works. And of all these that were hid, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> alone was seen by them, because he was a ruler of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says to them: How have you come into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: How have you come into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>? For you are a confederate of his, and his portion is with you in the world to come. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>. And likewise Joseph also stepped out and said to them: Why are you <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> against me because I begged the body of Jesus? Behold, I have put him in my new tomb, wrapping him in clean linen; and I have rolled a stone to the door of the tomb. And you have acted not well against the just man, because you have not repented of crucifying him, but also have pierced him with a spear. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> seized Joseph, and ordered him to be secured until the first day of the week, and said to him: Know that the time does not allow us to do anything against you, because the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> is dawning; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you shall not be deemed worthy of burial, but we shall give your flesh to the birds of the air. Joseph says to them: These are the words of the arrogant Goliath, who reproached the living God and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David. <span class="stiki" id="note081839"><a href="../bible/1sa017.htm#verse44">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;17:44</a></span> For God has said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, says the Lord.  And now he that is uncircumcised in flesh, but <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> in heart, has taken water, and washed his hands in the face of the sun, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man; see ye to it. And you answered and said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, His blood be upon us, and upon our children. And now I am afraid lest the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God come upon you, and upon your children, as you have said. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, hearing these words, were embittered in their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and seized Joseph, and locked him into a room where there was no window; and guards were stationed at the door, and they sealed the door where Joseph was locked in.</p>

<p>And on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>,  and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, made a decree that all should be found in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> on the first day of the week. And rising up early, all the multitude in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> consulted by what death they should slay him. And when the Sanhedrin was sitting, they ordered him to be brought with much indignity. And having opened the door, they found him not. And all the people were surprised, and struck with dismay, because they found the seals unbroken, and because <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> had the key. And they no longer dared to lay hands upon those who had spoken before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> in Jesus' behalf.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>And while they were still sitting in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and wondering about Joseph, there come some of the guard whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had begged of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to guard the tomb of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> might not come and steal Him. And they reported to the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, what had happened: how there had been a great earthquake; and we saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> coming down from heaven, and he rolled away the stone from the mouth of the tomb, and sat upon it; and he shone like snow, and like lightning. And we were very much afraid, and lay like dead men; and we heard the voice of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> saying to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who remained beside the tomb, Be not afraid, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you seek Jesus who was crucified. He is not here: He is risen, as He said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay: and go quickly, and tell His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He is risen from the dead, and is in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note081842"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;28:5-7</a></span> </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: To what <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> did he speak? The men of the guard say: We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who they were. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: At what time was this? The men of the guard say: At midnight. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: And wherefore did you not lay hold of them? The men of the guard say: We were like dead men from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, not expecting to see the light of day, and how could we lay hold of them? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: As the Lord lives, we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you. The men of the guard say to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: You have seen so great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the case of this man, and have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; and how can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us? And assuredly you have done well to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> that the Lord lives, for indeed He does live. Again the men of the guard say: We have heard that you have locked up the man that begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and put a seal on the door; and that you have opened it, and not found him. Do you then give us the man whom you were guarding, and we shall give you Jesus. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: Joseph has gone away to his own city. The men of the guard say to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: And Jesus has risen, as we heard from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and is in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</p>

<p>And when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> heard these words, they were very much afraid, and said: We must take care lest this story be heard, and all incline to Jesus. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> called a council, and paid down a considerable sum of money, and gave it to the soldiers, saying: Say, while we slept, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came by night and stole him; and if this come to the ears of the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a>, we shall persuade him, and keep you out of trouble. And they took it, and said as they had been instructed. </p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>And Phinees a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Adas a teacher, and Haggai a Levite, came down from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to Jerusalem, and said to the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>: We saw Jesus and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> sitting on the mountain called Mamilch;  and he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Go into all the world, and preach to every creature: he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved, and he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not shall be condemned. And these signs shall attend those who have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: in my name they shall cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, speak new tongues, take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall by no means hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall be well. And while Jesus was speaking to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, we saw him taken up to heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note081845"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse15">Mark&nbsp;16:15-18</a></span> </p>

<p>The elders and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> say: Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and confess to Him whether you have heard and seen those things of which you have given us an account. And those who had given the account said: As the Lord lives, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob, we heard these things, and saw him taken up into heaven. The elders and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> say to them: Have you come to give us this announcement, or to offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to God? And they say: To offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The elders and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> say to them: If you have come to offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why then have you told these idle tales in the presence of all the people?  Says Phinees the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Adas the teacher, and Haggai the Levite to the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>: If what we have said and seen be sinful, behold, we are before you; do to us as seems good in your eyes. And they took the law, and made them <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> upon it, not to give any more an account of these matters to any one. And they gave them to eat and drink, and sent them out of the city, having given them also money, and three men with them; and they sent them away to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. And these men having gone into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the elders, came together into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and locked the door, and lamented with a great lamentation, saying: Is this a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> that has happened in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? And <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> said: Why are you so much moved? Why do you weep? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have given a sum of gold to the guards of the tomb, and have instructed them to say that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came down and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb? And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the elders said: Be it that his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have stolen his body; how is it that the life has come into his body, and that he is going about in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>? And they being unable to give an answer to these things, said, after great hesitation: It is not lawful for us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the uncircumcised.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> stood up, and stood before the Sanhedrin, saying: You say well;  you are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, you people of the Lord, of these men that come down from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, that they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are men of substance, haters of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, men of peace; and they have declared with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, We saw Jesus upon the mountain Mamilch with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and he taught what we heard from him, and we saw him taken up into heaven. And no one asked them in what form he went up. For assuredly, as the book of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> taught us, Helias also was taken up into heaven, and Eliss&aelig;us cried out with a loud voice, and Helias threw his sheepskin upon Eliss&aelig;us, and Eliss&aelig;us threw his sheepskin upon the Jordan, and crossed, and came into <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. And the children of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> met him, and said, O Eliss&aelig;us, where is your master Helias? And he said, He has been taken up into heaven. And they said to Eliss&aelig;us, Has not a spirit seized him, and thrown him upon one of the mountains? But let us take our servants  with us, and seek him. And they persuaded Eliss&aelig;us, and he went away with them. And they sought him three days, and did not find him; and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> he had been taken up. <span class="stiki" id="note081849"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;2:12-18</a></span> And now listen to me, and let us send into every district of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and see lest perchance Christ has been taken up by a spirit, and thrown upon one of the mountains? And this proposal pleased all. And they sent into every district of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and sought Jesus, and did not find Him; but they found Joseph in Arimath&aelig;a, and no one dared to lay hands on him.</p>

<p>And they reported to the elders, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>: We have gone round to every district of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and have not found Jesus; but Joseph we have found in Arimath&aelig;a. And hearing about Joseph, they were glad, and gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, having held a council as to the manner in which they should meet with Joseph, took a piece of paper, and wrote to Joseph as follows:&mdash; </p>

<p>Peace to you! We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and against you; and we have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that you should deign to come to your fathers, and to your children, because we have all been grieved. For having opened the door, we did not find you. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have counselled <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel against you; but the Lord has defended you, and the Lord Himself has scattered to the winds our counsel against you, O <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> father Joseph.</p>

<p>And they chose from all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> seven men, friends of Joseph, whom also Joseph himself was acquainted with; and the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, say to them: Take notice: if, after receiving our letter, he read it, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he will come with you to us; but if he do not read it, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is ill-disposed towards us. And having saluted him in peace, return to us. And having blessed the men, they dismissed them. And the men came to Joseph, and did reverence to him, and said to him: Peace to you! And he said: Peace to you, and to all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>! And they gave him the roll of the letter. And Joseph having received it, read the letter and rolled it up, and blessed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said: Blessed be the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, who has delivered <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that they should not shed innocent blood; and blessed be the Lord, who sent out His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and covered me under his wings. And he set a table for them; and they ate and drank, and slept there. And they rose up early, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. And Joseph saddled his ass, and set out with the men; and they came to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city Jerusalem. And all the people met Joseph, and cried out: Peace to you in your coming in! And he said to all the people: Peace to you! And he kissed them. And the people <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with Joseph, and they were astonished at the sight of him. And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> received him into his house, and made a great feast, and called <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, and the elders, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> to his house. And they rejoiced, eating and drinking with Joseph; and after singing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, each proceeded to his own house. But Joseph remained in the house of <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>.</p>

<p>And on the following day, which was the preparation, the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> went early to the house of <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>; and <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> met them, and said: Peace to you! And they said: Peace to you, and to Joseph, and to all your house, and to all the house of Joseph! And he brought them into his house. And all the Sanhedrin sat down, and Joseph sat down between <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>: and no one dared to say a word to him. And Joseph said: Why have you called me? And they signalled to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> to speak to Joseph. And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, opening his mouth, said to Joseph: Father, you know that the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> teachers, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, see to learn a word from you. And Joseph said: Ask. And <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> having taken the law, made Joseph <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, saying: Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and give Him confession; for Achar being made to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jesus,  did not forsware himself, but declared unto him all, and did not hide a word from him. Do thou also accordingly not hide from us to the extent of a word. And Joseph said: I shall not hide from you one word. And they said to him: With grief were we grieved because you begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and wrap it in clean linen, and lay it in a tomb. And on account of this we secured you in a room where there was no windows: and we put locks and seals upon the doors and guards kept watching where you were locked in. And on the first day of the week we opened, and found you not, and were grieved exceedingly; and astonishment fell upon all the people of the Lord until yesterday. And now relate to us what has happened to you.</p>

<p>And Joseph said: On the preparation, about the tenth hour, you locked me up, and I remained all the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. And at midnight, as I was standing and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, the room where you locked me in was hung up by the four corners, and I saw a light like lightning into my eyes. <span class="stiki" id="note081851"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;10:11</a></span> And I was afraid, and fell to the ground. And some one took me by the hand, and removed me from the place where I had fallen; and moisture of water was poured from my head even to my feet, and a smell of perfumes came about my nostrils. And he wiped my face, and kissed me, and said to me, Fear not, Joseph; open your eyes, and see who it is that speaks to you. And looking up, I saw Jesus. And I trembled and thought it was a phantom; and I said the commandments, and he said them with me.  Even so you are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that a phantom, if it meet anybody, and hear the commandments, takes to flight. And seeing that he said them with me, I said to him, Rabbi Helias. And he said to me, I am not Helias. And I said to him, Who are you, my lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus, whose body you begged from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>; and you clothed me with clean linen, and put a napkin on my face, and laid me in your new tomb, and rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb. And I said to him that was speaking to me, Show me the place where I laid you. And he carried me away, and showed me the place where I laid him; and the linen cloth was lying in it, and the napkin for his face. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was Jesus. And he took me by the hand, and placed me, though the doors were locked, in the middle of my house, and led me away to my bed, and said to me, Peace to you! And he kissed me, and said to me, For forty days go not forth out of your house; for, behold, I go to my brethren into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>And the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, when they heard these words from Joseph, became as dead, and fell to the ground, and fasted until the ninth hour. And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, along with Joseph, exhorted <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, saying: Rise up and stand upon your feet, and taste bread, and strengthen your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, because tomorrow is the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> of the Lord. And they rose up, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and ate and drank, and departed every man to his own house.</p>

<p>And on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> our teachers and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> sat questioning each other, and saying: What is this <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that has come upon us? For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his father and mother. Levi, a teacher, says: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do not withdraw themselves from the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and give the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> thrice a year.  And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> brought him to this place, and gave <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and burnt-offerings to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when the great teacher Symeon took him into his arms, he said, Now You send away Your servant, Lord, according to Your word, in peace; for my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which You have prepared before the face of all the peoples: a light for the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Your people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And Symeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, I give you good news about this child. And Mary said, It is well, my lord. And Symeon said to her, It is well; behold, he lies for the fall and rising again of many in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for a sign spoken against; and of you yourself a sword shall go through the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in order that the reasoning of many hearts may be revealed. <span class="stiki" id="note081854"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;2:25-35</a></span> </p>

<p>They say to the teacher Levi: How do you know these things? Levi says to them: Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that from him I learned the law? The Sanhedrin say to him: We wish to see your father. And they sent for his father. And they asked him; and he said to them: Why have you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> my son? The blessed and just Symeon himself taught him the law. The Sanhedrin says to Rabbi Levi: Is the word that you have said <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? And he said: It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, said to themselves: Come, let us send into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to the three men that came and told about his teaching and his taking up, and let them tell us how they saw him taken up. And this saying pleased all. And they sent away the three men who had already gone away into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> with them; and they say to them: Say to Rabbi Adas, and Rabbi Phinees, and Rabbi Haggai: Peace to you, and all who are with you! A great inquiry having taken place in the Sanhedrin, we have been sent to you to call you to this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, Jerusalem.</p>

<p>And the men set out into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and found them sitting and considering the law; and they saluted them in peace. And the men who were in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> said to those who had come to them: Peace upon all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>! And they said: Peace to you! And they again said to them: Why have you come? And those who had been sent said: The Sanhedrin call you to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city Jerusalem. And when the men heard that they were sought by the Sanhedrin, they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and reclined with the men, and ate and drank, and rose up, and set out in peace to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>And on the following day the Sanhedrin sat in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and asked them, saying: Did you really see Jesus sitting on the mountain Mamilch teaching his eleven <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and did you see him taken up? And the men answered them, and said: As we saw him taken up, so also we said.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> says: Take them away from one another, and let us see whether their account agrees. And they took them away from one another. And first they call Adas, and say to him: How did you see Jesus taken up? Adas says: While he was yet sitting on the mountain Mamilch, and teaching his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, we saw a cloud overshadowing both him and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And the cloud took him up into heaven, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> lay upon their face upon the earth. And they call Phinees the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and ask him also, saying: How did you see Jesus taken up? And he spoke in like manner. And they again asked Haggai, and he spoke in like manner. And the Sanhedrin said: The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> holds: At the mouth of two or three every word shall be established. <span class="stiki" id="note081855"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;17:6</a></span> Buthem, a teacher, says: It is written in the law, And <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> walked with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is not, because God took him.  Jairus, a teacher, said: And the death of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> we have heard of, and have not seen it; for it is written in the law of the Lord, And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> died from the mouth of the Lord, and no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of his sepulchre unto this day. <span class="stiki" id="note081857"><a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;34:5-6</a></span> And Rabbi Levi said: Why did Rabbi Symeon say, when he saw Jesus, <q>Behold, he lies for the fall and rising again of many in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for a sign spoken against?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note081858"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;2:34</a></span> And Rabbi Isaac said: It is written in the law, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who shall go before you to keep you in every good way, because my name has been called upon him. </p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> said: Rightly have you said what is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, that no one saw the death of <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and no one has named the death of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; but Jesus was tried before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and we saw him receiving blows and spittings on his face, and the soldiers put about him a crown of thorns, and he was scourged, and received sentence from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and was crucified upon the Cranium, and two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> with him; and they gave him to drink vinegar with gall, and Longinus the soldier pierced his side with a spear; and Joseph our <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> father begged his body, and, as he says, he is risen; and as the three teachers say, We saw him taken up into heaven; and Rabbi Levi has given evidence of what was said by Rabbi Symeon, and that he said, Behold, he lies for the fall <em>and</em> rising again of many in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for a sign spoken against. And all the teachers said to all the people of the Lord: If this was from the Lord, and is wonderful in your eyes,  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O house of Jacob, that it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs upon a tree.  And another Scripture teaches: The gods which have not made the heaven and the earth shall be destroyed. <span class="stiki" id="note081862"><a href="../bible/jer010.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;10:11</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> said to each other: If his memorial be until the <em>year</em> that is called Jobel,  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it shall it endure for ever, and he has raised for himself a new people. Then the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, announced to all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, saying: Cursed is that man who shall worship the work of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> hand, and cursed is the man who shall worship the creatures more than the Creator. And all the people said, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>. </p>

<p>And all the people praised  the Lord, and said: Blessed is the Lord, who has given rest to His people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, according to all that He has spoken; there has not fallen one word of every good word of His that He spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> His servant. May the Lord our God be with us, as He was with our fathers: let Him not destroy us. And let Him not destroy us, that we may incline our hearts to Him, that we may walk in all His ways, that we may keep His commandments and His judgments which He commanded to our fathers. <span class="stiki" id="note081866"><a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse56">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;8:56-58</a></span> And the Lord shall be for a king over all the earth in that day; and there shall be one Lord, and His name one. <span class="stiki" id="note081867"><a href="../bible/zec014.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;14:9</a></span> The Lord is our king: He shall save us. <span class="stiki" id="note081868"><a href="../bible/isa033.htm#verse22">Isaiah&nbsp;33:22</a></span> There is none like You, O Lord.  Great are You, O Lord, and great is Your name. By Your power heal us, O Lord, and we shall be healed: save us, O Lord, and we shall be saved; <span class="stiki" id="note081870"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse14">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:14</a></span> because we are Your lot and heritage. And the Lord will not leave His people, for His great name's sake; for the Lord has begun to make us into His people. <span class="stiki" id="note081871"><a href="../bible/1sa012.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12:22</a></span> </p>

<p>And all, having sung praises, went away each man to his own house, glorifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for His is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
