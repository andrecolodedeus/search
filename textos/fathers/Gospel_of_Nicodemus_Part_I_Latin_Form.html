<h1>Gospel of Nicodemus (Part I, Latin Form)</h1>

<p><strong>The Acts of Pilate.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">I &AElig;neas</span> was at first a protector of the Hebrews, and follower of the law; then the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Saviour and His great gift took possession of me. I recognised Christ Jesus in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture; I came to Him, and embraced His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that I might become worthy of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. First of all I searched for the memoirs written in those times about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> published in the age of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, and we found them in Hebrew writings, drawn up in the age of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>; and I translated them into the language of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in the reign of the eminent Theodosius, who was fulfilling his seventeenth consulship, and of Valentinian, consul for the fifth time in the ninth indiction. Whosoever of you read this book, and transfer it to other copies, remember me, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me, &AElig;neas, least of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He be merciful to me, and pardon my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which I have committed against Him. Peace be to all who shall read these, and to all their house, for ever! <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass, in the nineteenth year of the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>, emperor of the Romans, and of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, son of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> king of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, in the nineteenth year of his rule, on the eighth day before the kalends of April, which is the twenty-fifth day of the month of March, in the consulship of Rufinus and Rubellio, in the fourth year of the 202d Olympiad, under the rule of Joseph and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: the things done by the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> recorded after the cross and passion of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> himself committed to Hebrew letters.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, Summas and Datam, <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a>, Judas, Levi, Neptalim, Alexander and Jairus, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, came to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, accusing the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> of many things, and saying: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him to be the son of Joseph the carpenter, born of Mary; and he says that he is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and a king. Not only so, but he also breaks the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and wishes to do away with the law of our fathers. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: What is it that he does, and wishes to destroy the law? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: We have a law, not to heal any one on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>; but he, by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arts, heals on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> the lame and the hunchbacked, the blind, the palsied, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: By what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> arts? They say to him: He is a sorcerer; and by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, prince of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, he casts out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and they are all subject to him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: It is not in an unclean spirit to cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, but in the god of Scolapius.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> your majesty to set him before your tribunal to be heard. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to him, says to them: How can I, seeing that I am a governor,  hear a king? They say to him: We do not say that he is a king, but he himself says he is. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling a runner, says to him: Let Jesus be brought in with kindness. And the runner, going out and recognising Him, adored Him, and spread on the ground the cloak which he carried in his hand, saying: My lord, walk upon this, and come in, because the governor calls you. But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, seeing what the runner did, cried out against <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, saying: Why did not you make him come in by the voice of a crier, but by a runner? For the runner, too, seeing him, has adored him, and has spread out before him on the ground the cloak which he held in his hand, and has said to him: My lord, the governor calls you.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling the runner, says to him: Wherefore have you done this, and honoured Jesus, who is called Christ? The runner says to him: When you sent me into Jerusalem to Alexander, I saw him sitting upon an ass, and the children of the Hebrews breaking branches from the trees, strewing them in the way; and others held branches in their hands; and others spread their garments in the way, shouting and saying, Save, therefore, You who are in the highest; blessed <em>is He</em> that comes in the name of the Lord!</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cried out, saying against the runner: The children of the Hebrews indeed cried out in Hebrew. How can you, a Gentile, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this? The runner says to them: I asked one of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and said, What is it that they cry out in Hebrew? And he explained to me. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: And how did they cry out in Hebrew? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: Osanna in the highest! <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: What is the meaning of Osanna in the highest? They say to him: Save us, You who are in the highest. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: If you yourselves bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the terms and words in which the children cried out, in what has the runner <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? And they were silent. The governor says to the runner: Go out, and lead him in, in whatever way you will. And the runner, going forth, did after the same form as before, and says to Jesus: My lord, go in, because the governor calls you.</p>

<p>As Jesus, then, was going in, and the standard-bearers bearing the standards, the heads of the standards were bowed of themselves, and adored Jesus. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, seeing the standards, how they bowed themselves and adored Jesus, cried out the more against the standard-bearers. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Do you not wonder at the way in which the standards have bowed themselves and adored Jesus? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: we saw how the men carrying the standards bowed themselves and adored Jesus. And the governor, calling the standard-bearers, says to them: Why have you so done? They say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We are Gentile men, and slaves of the temples: how had we  to adore him? For when we were holding the figures,  they themselves bowed and adored him.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and the elders of the people: Choose ye men powerful and strong, and let them hold the standards, and let us see whether they will bow of themselves. And the elders of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, taking twelve men very strong and powerful, made them hold the standards, six and six; and they stood before the governor's tribunal. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the runner: Take out Jesus outside of the pr&aelig;torium, and bring him in again, in whatever way you will. And Jesus and the runner went outside of the pr&aelig;torium. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling those who had formerly held the standards, said to them: By the health of C&aelig;sar, if the standards do not bow themselves when Jesus comes in, I will cut off your heads. And the governor ordered Jesus to come in a second time. And the runner did after the same form as before, and besought Jesus much that He would go up and walk upon his cloak. And He walked upon it, and went in. And as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was going in, immediately the standards bowed themselves, and adored Jesus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> seeing, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> seized him, and immediately he wished to rise from the tribunal. And while he was thinking of this, <em>viz</em>., to rise and go away, his wife sent to him, saying: Have nothing to do with that just man,  for I have suffered much on account of him this night. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, said to them: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my wife is a worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a> thinks rather with you. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: So it is, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: Lo, my wife has sent to me, saying: Have nothing to do with that just man,  for I have suffered much on account of him this night. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answering, said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Did we not say to you that he is a magician? Lo, he has sent a vision of dreams to your wife.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> called Jesus, and said to him: What is it that these <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against you, and do you say nothing to them? And Jesus answered: If they had not the power, they would not speak. Every one has power over his own mouth to say good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; let them see  <em>to it</em>.</p>

<p>And the elders of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answering, say to Jesus: What shall we see? First, that you were born of fornication; second, that at your birth in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> there took place a massacre of infants; third, that your father Joseph and your mother Mary fled into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, because they had no confidence in the people.</p>

<p>Some of the bystanders, kind <em>men</em> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, say: We say that he was not born of fornication; but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Mary was espoused to Joseph, and that he was not born of fornication. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who said that he was of fornication: This speech of yours is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, seeing that the betrothal took place, as these of your nation say. <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We with all the multitude say that he was born of fornication, and that he is a magician; but these are proselytes, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, says to them: What are proselytes? They say to him: They have been born sons of the Gentiles,  and then have become <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Then answered those who testified that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not born of fornication, Lazarus and Asterius, Antonius and James, Annes and Azaras, Samuel and Isaac, Finees and Crispus, Agrippa and Judas: We were not born proselytes, but are sons of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and we speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for we were present at the betrothal of Mary.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling to him those twelve men who <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had not been born of fornication, said to them: I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you by the health of C&aelig;sar, tell me if it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not born of fornication. They say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We have a law not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, because it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but let them <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the health of C&aelig;sar that it is not as we say, and we are worthy of death. Then said <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>: Answer you nothing to those things which these testify? <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Those twelve are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he is not born of fornication; we&mdash; all the people&mdash; cry out that he was born of fornication, and is a magician, and says that he himself is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and a king, and we are not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> ordered all the multitude to go outside, except the twelve men who said that He was not born of fornication, and ordered to separate Jesus from them. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: For what reason do the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> wish to put Jesus to death? And they say to him: They are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> because he heals on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: For a good work do they wish to put him to death? They say to him: Yes, my lord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, filled with fury, went forth outside of the pr&aelig;torium, and says to them: I take the sun to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that I find in this man not even one fault. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered and said to the governor: If he were not an evil-doer, we should never have delivered him to you. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: Take him, and judge him according to your law. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered: It is not permitted to us to put any one to death. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: Has God said to you not to put any one to death? Has He therefore said to me that I am to kill?</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, having again gone into the pr&aelig;torium, called Jesus to him privately, and said to Him: Are you the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Jesus answered <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Do you speak this of yourself, or have others said <em>it</em> to you of me? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered: Am I a Jew? Your nation and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have delivered you to me. What have you done? Jesus answering, said: My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would assuredly strive that I should not be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but now my kingdom is not from hence. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said to Him: Are you then a king? Jesus said to him: You say that I am a king. For I for this was born, and for this have I come, that I should bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and every one who is of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> hears my voice. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to him: What is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Jesus says: Truth is from heaven. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: Is not there <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> upon earth? Jesus says to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Notice how the truth-speaking are judged by those who have power upon earth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore, leaving Jesus within the pr&aelig;torium, went out to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and says to them: I find not even one fault in him. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: He said, I can destroy that temple, and in three days raise it again. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said to them: What temple? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: <em>The temple</em> which Solomon built in forty and six years; and he says <em>that he can</em> destroy and build it in three days. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: I am innocent of the blood of this man; see ye <em>to it</em>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: His blood <em>be</em> upon us, and upon our children.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling the elders and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, says to them privately: Do not do so; for in nothing, though you accuse him, do I find him deserving of death, not even about the healing and the breaking of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> and elders say: Tell us, if any one <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> C&aelig;sar, is he deserving of death or not? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: He deserves to die. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered him: How much more is he who has <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> God deserving to die!</p>

<p>And the governor ordered the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to go outside of the pr&aelig;torium; and calling Jesus, said to Him: What am I to do to you? Jesus says to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: As it has been given <em>you</em>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: How has it been given? Jesus says: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> made proclamation of my death and resurrection. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, hearing this, say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Why do you desire any more to hear <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>? And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: If this speech is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>, do you take him, and lead him to your <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and judge him according to your law. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Our law holds, If a man have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he is worthy to receive forty less one; but he who has <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: Then judge him according to your law. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We wish that he be crucified. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: He does not deserve to be crucified.</p>

<p>And the governor, looking upon the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> standing round, saw very many of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> weeping, and said: All the multitude does not wish him to die. The elders say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: And for this reason have we come&mdash; the whole multitude&mdash; that he should die. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: What has he done that he should die? They say: Because he said that he was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and a king.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p>But one <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, a Jew, stood before the governor, and said: I entreat, mercifully allow me to say a few words. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to him: Say on. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says: I said to the elders and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and to all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, What have you <em>to do</em> with this man? This man does many wonders and signs, which no one of men has done or can do. Let him go, and do not devise any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against him: if the signs which he does are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they will stand; but if of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they will come to nothing. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also, being sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, did many signs, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> told him to do before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And the sorcerers Jamnes and Mambres were there healing, and they did, they also, the signs which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did, but not all; and the Egyptians deemed them as gods, Jamnes and Mambres. And since the signs which they did were not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they perished, both they and those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in them. And now let this man go, for he is not deserving of death.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>: You have become his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and takest his part.  <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says to them: Has the governor also become his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and does he take his part? Has not C&aelig;sar set him over that dignity? And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were raging and gnashing with their teeth against <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: Why do you gnash with your teeth against him, <em>when you are</em> hearing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>: May you receive his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and a portion with him! <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>; may I receive <em>it</em>, as you have said!</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p>And of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a certain other one, starting up, asks the governor that he might say a word. The governor says: What you wish to say, say. And he said: For thirty-eight years I lay in infirmity in my bed in very grievous pain. And at the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, many <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>, and <em><a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a></em> held down by various infirmities, were healed by him. And some young men had pity on me; and carrying me in my bed, laid me before him. And Jesus, seeing, had pity on me, and said the word to me, Take up your bed, and walk. And immediately I was made whole; I took up my bed, and walked. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Ask him what was the day on which he was healed. He said: The <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: Have we not so informed you, that on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> he heals, and drives out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>?</p>

<p>And a certain other Jew starting up, said: I was born blind; I heard a voice, and saw no man. And as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was passing by, I cried out with a loud voice, Have pity upon me, you son of David. And he had pity upon me, and laid his hands upon my eyes, and I saw immediately. And another Jew starting up, said: I was hunchbacked, and he straightened me with a word. And another said: I was <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprous</a>, and he healed me with a word.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p>And also a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, Veronica by name, from afar off cried out to the governor: I was flowing with blood for twelve years; and I touched the fringe of his garment, and immediately the flowing of my blood stopped. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: We have a law, that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> does not come to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p>And certain others, a multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, cried out, saying: That man is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are subject to him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to those who said the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are subject to him: And your masters, why are they not subject to him? They say to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And others said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: He raised up dead Lazarus from the tomb after four days. The governor, hearing this, said trembling to all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: Why do you wish to shed innocent blood?</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> and the twelve men who said that He was not born of fornication, says to them: What am I to do, seeing that there is a sedition among the people? They say to him: We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; let them see to it. Again <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, said: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you have a custom during the day of unleavened bread, that I should release to you one that is bound. I have a notable one bound in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, a murderer who is called Barabbas, and Jesus who is called Christ, in whom I find no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of death. Whom do you wish that I should release unto you? And they all cried out, saying: Release unto us Barabbas. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: What, then, am I to do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all say: Let him be crucified. Again the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: You are no friend of C&aelig;sar's if you release this man, for he called himself the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and a king; unless, perhaps, you wish this man to be king, and not C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>Then, filled with fury, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said to them: Always has your nation been seditious, and always have you been opposed to those who were for you. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered: Who are for us? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them: Your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;who rescued you from the hard slavery of the Egyptians, and led you forth out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> through the sea as if through dry land, and fed you in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> with manna and quail, and brought water to you out of the rock, and gave you to drink, and gave you a law; and in all these things you provoked your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and sought for yourselves a god, a molten calf. And you exasperated your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He wished to slay you; and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> made supplication for you, that you should not die. And now you say that I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the king.</p>

<p>And rising up from the tribunal, he wished to go outside. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cried out, and said to him: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that C&aelig;sar is king, and not Jesus. For the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> also presented gifts to him as to a king; and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, hearing from the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> that a king was born, wished to slay him. But when this was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, his father Joseph took him and his mother, and fled into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> hearing, destroyed the infants of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which were born in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, hearing those words, was afraid. And silence being made among the people, who were crying out, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: This, then, is he whom <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> sought? They say to him: It is he. And taking water, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> washed his hands in presence of the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; see ye to it. Again the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cried out, saying: His blood be upon us, and upon our children.</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> ordered the veil to be loosened,  and said to Jesus: Your own nation have brought charges against you as a king; and therefore I have sentenced you first to be scourged on account of the statutes of the emperors, and then to be crucified on a cross.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was scourged, he delivered Him to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to be crucified, and two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> with Him; one by name Dismas, and the other by name Gestas. And when they came to the place, they stripped Him of His garments, and girt Him about with a linen cloth, and put a crown of thorns upon His head. Likewise also they hanged the two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> with Him, Dismas on the right and Gestas on the left. And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do. And the soldiers parted His garments among them. And the people stood waiting; and their chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and judges mocked Him, saying among themselves: He saved others, now let him save himself; if he is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, let him come down from the cross. And the soldiers mocked Him, falling prostrate  before Him, and offering vinegar with gall, and saying: If you are the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, set yourself free.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, after sentence, ordered a title to be written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin letters, according to what the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: This is the King of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>And one of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> <em>who were</em> hanged, by name Gestas, said to Him: If you are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, free yourself and us. And Dismas answering, rebuked him, saying: Do you not even <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who art in this condemnation? For we <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and deservedly have received those things which we endure; but He has done no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And he kept saying to Jesus: Remember me, Lord, in Your kingdom. And Jesus said to him: Verily I say unto you, that today shall you be with me in paradise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was darkness over the whole earth; and the sun was obscured, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. And crying out with a loud voice, He said: Father, into Your hands I commend my spirit. And thus saying, He gave up the ghost. And the centurion, seeing what was done, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying: This was a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man. And all the people who were present at that spectacle, seeing what was done, beating their breasts, returned.</p>

<p>And the centurion reported to the governor what was done. And the governor and his wife hearing, were very sorrowful, and neither ate nor drank that day. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, calling together the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, said to them: Have you seen what has been done? And they said to the governor: There has been an eclipse of the sun, as is usual.</p>

<p>And his acquaintances also stood afar off, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had followed Him from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, seeing these things. And lo, a certain man, by name Joseph, holding office, a man good and just, who did not consent to their counsels nor their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, from Arimath&aelig;a,  a city of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, waiting, he also, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, went to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and begged the body of Jesus. And taking Him down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, he wrapped Him in clean linen, and laid Him in his own new tomb, in which no one had been laid.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, hearing that Joseph had begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, sought for him; and those twelve men who had said that He was not born of fornication, and <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, and many others, who had stood before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> and declared His good works. And all of them being hid, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> alone appeared to them, because he was a chief man of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and he says to them: How have ye come into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to him: And you, how have you come into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, seeing that you consent with him? May his portion be with you in the world to come! <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> said: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>. Likewise also Joseph, coming forth, said to them: Why are you enraged against me because I begged the body of Jesus? Lo, I have laid him in my own new tomb, wrapping him in clean linen; and I have rolled a stone to the door of the cave. And you have not acted well against a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, since you have not borne in mind how you crucified him, and pierced him with a lance. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore, laying hold of Joseph, ordered him to be imprisoned because of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>; and they say to him: Know that the hour compels us not to do anything against you, because the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> is dawning. But understand that you are worthy not even of burial, but we will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth. Joseph says to them: That is the speech of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> Goliath, who reviled the living God against <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David. And God has said, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord. And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, intercepted  in his heart, took water, and washed his hands before the sun, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just man; see ye to it. And you answered and said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, His blood be upon us, and upon our children. And now I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that some time or other the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God will come upon you and your children, as you have said. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, hearing this, were embittered in heart; and taking Joseph, shut him up in a house where there was no window, and set guards at the gates, and sealed the gate where Joseph had been shut up.</p>

<p>And on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> morning they took counsel with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, that they should all be assembled after the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>. And awaking at dawn, all the multitude in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> took counsel by what death they should slay him. And when the assembly was sitting, they ordered him to be brought with much indignity; and opening the gate, they found him not. All the people therefore were in terror, and wondered with exceeding astonishment, because they found the seals sealed, and because <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> had the keys. And no longer did they dare to lay hand upon those who spoke before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> in Jesus' defence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>And while they were sitting in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and recriminating about Joseph, there came certain of the guards whom they had asked from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> to guard the sepulchre of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, lest His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> coming should steal Him. And they reported, saying to the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, what had happened: how there had happened a great earthquake, and we saw how an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord came down from heaven, and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb, and sat upon it; and his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment like snow. And for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, we became as dead. And we heard the voice of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> speaking to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who had come to the sepulchre, and saying, Be not ye afraid; for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you seek Jesus who was crucified: He is not here; He has risen, as He said: come and see the place where the Lord was laid. And go immediately and tell His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He has risen from the dead, and will go before you into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, as He said to you.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: To what <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> was he speaking? The soldiers say: We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: At what hour was it? The guards say: At midnight. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: And why did you not detain them? The guards say: We became as dead from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, not hoping now to see the light of day; and how could we detain them? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> says: <em>As</em> the Lord God lives, we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you. And the guards said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: You have seen so great signs in that man, and have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; and how can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us, that the Lord lives? For well have ye <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> lives. Again the guards say to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: we have heard that you have shut up Joseph, who begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and have sealed it with your rings; and on opening, that you have not found him. Give us Joseph, then, and we shall give you <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: Joseph has gone to Arimathea, his own city. The guards say to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: And Jesus, as we have heard from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, is in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, hearing these sayings, feared exceedingly, saying: Lest at some time or other this saying be heard, and all <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Jesus. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, taking counsel among themselves, brought forth a sufficient number of silver pieces, and gave to the soldiers, saying: Say that, while we slept, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came and stole him. And if this be heard by the governor, we shall persuade  him, and make you secure. And the soldiers, taking <em>the money</em>, said as they were advised by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and their saying was spread abroad among all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>And Finees a certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Addas a teacher, and Egias a Levite, coming down from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to Jerusalem, reported to the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, how they had seen Jesus sitting, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with him, on the Mount of Olivet, which is called Mambre or Malech. And he said to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: Go into all the world, and declare to every creature the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. He who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> and is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved; but he who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not shall be condemned. And these signs shall follow them who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: In my name shall they cast out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; they shall speak in new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they have drunk any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands upon the sick, and they shall be well. And as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was thus speaking to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, we saw him taken up into heaven. </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> and the elders say to them: Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and give confession to Him, whether you have both heard and seen those things which you have related. Those who had made the report say: As the Lord God of our fathers lives, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob, we have heard and seen. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to them: Have you come for this&mdash; to tell us? Or have you come to give <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to God? They said: We have come to give <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The elders and chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> say to them: And if you have come to give <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have you murmured before all the people about that foolish tale? Finees the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and Addas the teacher, and Egias the Levite, say to the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>: If those words which we have spoken, which we have seen and heard, be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, behold, we are in your presence; do unto us according to that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in your eyes. And they, taking the law, adjured them to report the words to no one thereafter. And they gave them to eat and drink, and put them outside of the city, giving them silver and pieces, and three men with them, who should conduct them as far as <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</p>

<p>Then the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> took counsel among themselves when those men had gone up into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; and the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> shut themselves in, and were cut up  with great fury, saying: What sign is this which has come to pass in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? And <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> say: Why are your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> sorrowful? Are we to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the soldiers, that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord came down from heaven, and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb? <em>No;</em> but that his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have given much gold to those who were guarding the sepulchre, and have taken Jesus away, and have taught them thus to say: Say ye that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord came down from heaven, and rolled away the stone from the door of the tomb. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is unlawful for <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> foreigners in a single word, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that these same who received sufficient gold from us have said as we taught them?</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> rising up, stood in the midst of the counsel, and said: You have said rightly. And are not the men who have come down from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> God-fearing, men of peace, hating a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>? And they recounted with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, how <q>we saw Jesus sitting on Mount Mambre with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and he taught them in our hearing,</q> and that they saw him taken up into heaven. And no one asked them this: How he was taken up into heaven. And, as the writing of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> book teaches us, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Elias too was taken up into heaven, and Elis&aelig;us cried out with a loud voice, and Elias threw his sheepskin over Elis&aelig;us; and again Elis&aelig;us threw that sheepskin over the Jordan, and went over and came to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. And the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> met him, and said to Elis&aelig;us, Where is your master Elias? And he said, He has been taken up into heaven. And they said to Elis&aelig;us, Has a spirit snatched him away, and thrown him upon one of the mountains? But rather let us take our boys  with us and seek him. And they persuaded Elis&aelig;us, and he went with them. And they sought him for three days and three nights, and found him not, because he was taken up. And now, men, hear me, and let us send into all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and see lest Jesus can have been taken up somewhere or other, and thrown upon one of the mountains. And that saying pleased all. And they sent to all the mountains of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to seek Jesus, and they found Him not; but they found Joseph of Arimath&aelig;a, and no one dared to lay hold of him.</p>

<p>And they reported to the elders and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>: We have gone round all the mountains of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and not found Jesus; but we have found Joseph in Arimath&aelig;a. And hearing of Joseph, they rejoiced, and gave <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, taking counsel in what manner they should send to Joseph, took paper, and wrote to Joseph:&mdash; </p>

<p>Peace to you and all that is yours! We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and against you; and you have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and He has delivered you out of our hands. And now deign to come to your fathers and your children, because we have been vehemently grieved. We have all sought for you&mdash; we who opened the door, and found you not. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we counselled <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel against you; but the Lord has supplanted our counsel against you. You are worthy to be honoured, father Joseph, by all the people.</p>

<p>And they chose out of all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> seven men friendly to Joseph, whom also Joseph <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be friendly; and the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> say to them: See, if he take the letter and read it, for certain he will come with you to us; but if he do not read it, you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is ill-disposed toward us, and, saluting him in peace, return to us. And blessing them, they sent them away. And they came to Arimath&aelig;a to Joseph, and adored him on their face upon the ground, and said: Peace to you and all yours! And Joseph said: Peace to you, and to all the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>! And they gave him the roll of the letter. And Joseph took and read it, and rolled up the letter, and blessed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said: Blessed <em>be</em> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, who has delivered <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> from shedding innocent blood; and blessed <em>be</em> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who sent His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and covered me under his wings. And he kissed them, and set a table for them; and they ate and drank, and slept there.</p>

<p>And they rose in the morning; and Joseph saddled his ass, and travelled with them, and they came into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city Jerusalem. And there met them all the people, crying out, and saying: Peace <em>be</em> in your coming in, father Joseph! To whom he answered and said: The peace of the Lord <em>be</em> upon all the people! And they all kissed him. And they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with Joseph, and were terrified at the sight of him. And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> took him into his house, and made a great feast, and called <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, and the elders and chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, to his house. And making merry, and eating and drinking with Joseph, they blessed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and went every one to his own house. And Joseph remained in the house of <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>.</p>

<p>And on the next day, which is the preparation, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> rose early, and came to the house of <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> met them, and said to them: Peace to you! And they said to him: Peace to you and Joseph, and to your house and Joseph's house! And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> brought them into his house. And the council sat; and Joseph sat between <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, and no one dared to say a word. And Joseph said to them: Why have you called me? And they made signs with their eyes to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, that he should speak with Joseph. And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, opening his mouth, said: Father Joseph, you know that the reverend teachers, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> seek to hear a word from you. And Joseph said: Ask. And <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, taking up the law, adjured Joseph, saying: Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and give confession to Him, that you will not hide any word  from us. And they said to him: With grief were we grieved that you begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and wrap it in clean linen, and lay it in a tomb. Therefore we shut you up in a house where there was no window, and put a lock and a seal on the gate; and on the first day of the week we opened the gates, and found you not. We were therefore exceedingly grieved, and astonishment came over all the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And therefore have you been sent for; and now tell us what has happened.</p>

<p>Then said Joseph: On the day of the Preparation, about the tenth hour, you shut me in, and I remained there the whole <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> in full. And when midnight came, as I was standing and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, the house where you shut me in was hung up by the four corners, and there was a flashing of light in my eyes. And I fell to the ground trembling. Then some one lifted me up from the place where I had fallen, and poured over me an abundance of water from the head even to the feet, and put round my nostrils the odour of a wonderful ointment, and rubbed my face with the water itself, as if washing me, and kissed me, and said to me, Joseph, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not; but open your eyes, and see who it is that speaks to you. And looking, I saw Jesus; and being terrified, I thought it was a phantom. And with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and the commandments I spoke to him, and he spoke with me. And I said to him: Are you Rabbi Elias? And he said to me: I am not Elias. And I said: Who are you, my lord? And he said to me: I am Jesus, whose body you begged from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and wrap in clean linen; and you laid a napkin on my face, and laid me in your new tomb, and roll a stone to the door of the tomb. Then I said to him that was speaking to me: Show me, Lord, where I laid you. And he led me, and showed me the place where I laid him, and the linen which I had put on him, and the napkin which I had wrapped upon his face; and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was Jesus. And he took hold of me with his hand, and put me in the midst of my house though the gates were shut, and put me in my bed, and said to me: Peace to you! And he kissed me, and said to me: For forty days go not out of your house; for, lo, I go to my brethren into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>And the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, hearing these words from Joseph, became as it were dead, and fell to the ground, and fasted until the ninth hour. And Joseph and <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> entreated them, saying: Arise and stand upon your feet, and taste bread, and comfort your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, seeing that tomorrow is the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> of the Lord. And they arose, and entreated the Lord, and ate and drank, and went every man to his own house.</p>

<p>And on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> the teachers and doctors sat questioning each other, and saying: What is this <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that has come upon us? Because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his father and mother. Levi the teacher said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and never depart from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and give <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> thrice a-year. And when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was born, his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> brought him up to this place, and gave to God <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and burnt-offerings. And assuredly the great teacher Simeon took him into his arms, saying: Now You send away Your servant, O Lord, according to Your word, in peace; for my eyes have seen Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which You have prepared before the face of all peoples, a light for the revealing of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Your people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. And he blessed Mary his mother, and said, I make an announcement to you concerning this child. And Mary said, Well, my lord.  And Simeon said, Well. And he said again, Lo, he has been set for the fall and rising again of many in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for a sign which shall be spoken against; and a sword shall pierce your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said to Levi: And how do you know these things? Levi says: Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that from him I learned the law? They of the council say: We wish to see your father. And they searched out his father, and got information; for he said: Why did you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> my son? The blessed and just Simeon taught him the law. The council says to Rabbi Levi: The saying which you have spoken is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. The chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and rulers of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, said to each other: Come, let us send into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to the three men who came hither and gave an account of his teaching and his being taken up, and let them tell us how they saw him taken up into heaven. And that saying pleased all. Then they sent three men into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; and Go, said they, say to Rabbi Addas and Rabbi Finees and Rabbi Egias, Peace to you and yours! Many investigations have been made in the council concerning Jesus; therefore have we been instructed to call you to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>The men went to <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and found them sitting, and meditating on the law. And they saluted them in peace. And they said: Why have you come? The messengers said: The council summon you to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city Jerusalem. And the men, hearing that they were sought for by the council, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and reclined with the men, and ate and drank with them. And rising in the morning, they went to Jerusalem in peace.</p>

<p>And on the morrow the council sat; and they questioned them, saying: Did you plainly see Jesus sitting on Mount Mambre teaching his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and taken up into heaven?</p>

<p>First Addas the teacher says: I really saw him sitting on Mount Mambre teaching his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; and a shining cloud overshadowed him and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and he went up into heaven; and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> upon their faces on the ground. And calling Finees the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, they questioned him also, saying: How did you see Jesus taken up? And he said the same as the other. And again they called the third, Rabbi Egias, and questioned him, and he said the same as the first and second. And those who were in the council said: The <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> holds that by the mouth of two or three every word should stand. Abudem, a teacher, one of the doctors, says: It is written in the law, <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> walked with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was translated; for God took him. Jairus, a teacher, said: And we have heard of the death of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and have not seen <em>it</em>; for it is written in the law of the Lord, And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> died according to the word  of the Lord, and no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of his burying even to the present day. Rabbi Levi said: What is it that Rabbi Simeon said: Lo, he lies for the fall and rising again of many in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for a sign which shall be spoken against? Rabbi Isaac said: It is written in the law, Lo, I send mine <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, who shall go before your face to keep you in every good way, because I have brought his  new name.</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> said: Rightly have ye said that these things are written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, that no one saw the death of <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and no one has named the burying of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. And Jesus gave account to  <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and we saw him scourged, and receiving spitting on his face; and the soldiers put a crown of thorns on him, and he received sentence from <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>; and then he was crucified, and they gave him gall and vinegar to drink, and two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> were crucified with him, and the soldier Longinus pierced his side with a lance; and our <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> father Joseph begged his body, and he has risen again, and, as they say, the three teachers have seen him taken up into heaven. And Rabbi Levi has borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to what was said by Simeon the elder&mdash; that he has been set for the fall and rising again of many in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and for a sign which shall be spoken against.</p>

<p>Then Didas, a teacher, said to all the assembly: If all the things which these have borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to have come to pass in Jesus, they are from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and let it not be wonderful in our eyes.  The chiefs of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, said to each other how our law holds, saying: His name shall be blessed for ever: His place endures before the sun, and His seat before the moon: and all the tribes of earth shall be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in Him, and all nations shall serve Him; and kings shall come from far, adoring and magnifying Him. </p>
