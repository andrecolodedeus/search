<h1>Gospel of Nicodemus (Part I, Second Greek Form)</h1>

<p><span class="sc">A narrative</span> about the suffering of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> resurrection.</p>

<p>Written by a Jew, &AElig;neas by name, and translated out of the Hebrew tongue into the Romaic language by <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, a Roman toparch.</p>

<p>After the dissolution of the kingdom of the Hebrews, four hundred years having run their course, and the Hebrews also coming at last under the kingdom of the Romans, and the king of the Romans appointing them a king; when <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a> at last swayed the Roman sceptre, in the eighteenth year of his reign,  he appointed as king of Jud&aelig;a, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, the son of the <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> who had formerly slaughtered the infants in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and he made <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> in Jerusalem; when <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> held the high-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of Jerusalem, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, a Roman toparch, having summoned a Jew, &AElig;neas by name, asked him to write an account of the things done in Jerusalem about Christ in the times of <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>. The Jew accordingly did this, and delivered it to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>; and he, again, translated it from the Hebrew writing into the Romaic language. And the account is as follows:&mdash; </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> having wrought in Jud&aelig;a many and great and extraordinary <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and on account of this being <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the Hebrews, while <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> was <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> in Jerusalem, and <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a>, there came of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, Judas, Levi, Nephthalim, Alexander, Syrus, and many others, speaking against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And these chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sent them away to say these things to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> also. And they went away, and said to him: A man walks about in this city whose father is called Joseph, and his mother Mary; and he calls himself king and <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; and being a Jew, he overturns the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and does away with the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> then asked, in order to learn from them in what manner he did away with the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. And they answered, saying: He cures the sick on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: If he makes the sick whole, he does no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. They say to him: If he effected the cures properly, small would be the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but by using magic he does these things, and by having the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> on his side. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: To cure a person that is ill is not a diabolic work, but a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>The Hebrews said: We beseech your highness to summon him, in order that you may make accurate inquiry into what we say. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore, throwing off his cloak, gave it to one of his officers,  saying: Go away, and show this to Jesus, and say to him, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> the <a href="../cathen/12451a.htm">procurator</a> calls you to come before him. The officer accordingly went away, and finding Jesus, summoned Him, having unfolded on the ground also <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate's</a> mantle, and urged Him to walk upon it. And the Hebrews, seeing this, and being greatly enraged, came to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, murmuring against him, how he had deemed Jesus worthy of so great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>

<p>And he, having inquired of the officer who had been sent how he had done so, the officer answered: When you sent me to the Jew Alexander, I came upon Jesus entering the gate of the city, sitting upon an ass. And I saw that the Hebrews spread their garments in the way, and the ass walked upon the garments; and others cut branches, and they went forth to meet him, and cried out, <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> in the highest! Thus, therefore, it was necessary for me also to do.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, hearing these words, said to him: How did you, being a Roman, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what was said by the Hebrews? The officer answered: I asked one of the Hebrews, and he told me these things. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: What means <a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a>? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: Save us, O Lord. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered: Since you confess that your children said so, how now do you bring charges, and say against Jesus what you do say? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were silent, and had nothing to answer. </p>

<p>Now, as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was coming to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, the soldiers of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> adored Him. And others also were standing before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> holding standards. And as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was coming, the standards also bowed down, and adored Him. As <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, therefore, was wondering at what had happened, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said to him: My lord, it was not the standards that adored Jesus, but the soldiers who were holding them carelessly.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: Choose twelve powerful men, and give them the standards, so that they may hold them firmly. And this having taken place, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> ordered the officer to take Jesus outside, and bring Him in again. And as He was coming in, the standards again bowed down, and adored Him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore wondered greatly. But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: He is a magician, and through that he does these things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to Jesus: Do you hear what these testify against you, and do you not answer? <span class="stiki" id="note081875"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;27:13-14</a></span> And Jesus answered and said: Every man has power to speak either good or bad, as he wishes; these also, therefore, having power, say what they wish. <span class="stiki" id="note081876"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;19:11</a></span> </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said to Him: What have we to say about you? First, that you were begotten from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; second, that on account of you, when you were born, the infants  were murdered; third, that your father and your mother fled into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, because they had no confidence in the people.</p>

<p>To these the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were there present, God-fearing men, answered and said: We say that his birth is not from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Joseph received into keeping his mother Mary, according to the practice of betrothal. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: Consequently you lie who say that his birth is from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. They say again to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: All the people testify that he is a magician. The God-fearing <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered and said: We also were at the betrothal of his mother, and we are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all his daily life; but that he is a magician, that we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that thus said were these: Lazarus, Astharius, Antonius, James, Zaras, Samuel, Isaac, Phinees, Crispus, Dagrippus, Amese, and Judas.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore says to them: By the life of C&aelig;sar, I wish you to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> whether the birth of this man is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. They answered: Our law lays down that we are to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> not at all, because an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> is great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Notwithstanding, by the life of C&aelig;sar we <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> that his birth is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and if we lie, order us all to be beheaded. And when they had thus spoken, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that were bringing the charge answered <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and said: And do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these twelve single <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> more than all the multitude and us, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain that he is a magician and blasphemer, and that he names himself <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> ordered them all to go forth out of the pr&aelig;torium except the said twelve alone. And when this had been done, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says to them privately: As to this man, it appears that from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> wish to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> him: for of one thing&mdash; that he does away with the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>&mdash; they accuse him; but he then does a good work, because he cures the sick. For this, sentence of death is not upon the man. The twelve also say to him: Assuredly, my lord, it is so.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore went outside in rage and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and says to <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, and to the crowd who brought Jesus: I take the sun to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that I find no fault in this man. The crowd answered: If he were not a sorcerer, and a magician, and a blasphemer, we should not have brought him to your highness. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: Try him yourselves; and since you have a law, do as your law says. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: Our law permits to put no man to death. <span class="stiki" id="note081878"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;19:6-7</a></span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: If you are unwilling to put him to death, how much more am I!</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> returned to the palace, and says to Jesus: Tell me, are you the king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Jesus answered: Do you say this, or have the other <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said this to you, that you might question me? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: You do not think that I am a Hebrew? I am not a Hebrew. Your people and the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> have delivered you into my hands; and tell me if you are king of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Jesus answered: My kingdom is not of this world; for if my kingdom were in this world, my soldiers would not be unconcerned at my being seized: wherefore my kingdom is not in this world. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: But are you a king? Jesus said: You have said: for this was I born, to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and if any one be a man of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he believes my word, and does it. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: What is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note081879"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;18:33-38</a></span> Jesus answered: The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is from the heavens. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: On earth, then, is there no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Christ says: I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and how is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> judged on earth by those that have earthly power!</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore, leaving Christ alone, went outside, and says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: I find no fault in this man. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> answered: Let us tell your highness what he said. He said, I am able to destroy the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in three days to build it. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: And what temple did he say that he was to destroy? The Hebrews say: The temple of Solomon, which Solomon built in forty-six years. <span class="stiki" id="note081880"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse20">John&nbsp;2:20</a></span> </p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says privately to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>: I entreat you, do nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against this man; for if you do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against him, you will do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>: for it is not just that such a man should die, who has done great good to many men. They said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: If, my lord, he who has dishonoured C&aelig;sar is worthy of death, how much more this <em>man</em> who dishonours God!</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> dismissed them, and they all went outside. Thereupon he says to Jesus: What do you wish that I shall do to you? Jesus says to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Do to me as is determined. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: How is it determined? Jesus answered: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> wrote about me being crucified, and rising again. The Hebrews, hearing <em>this</em>, said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: Why do you seek to hear a greater insult out of him against God? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: These words are not an insult against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since they are written in the books of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The Hebrews said: Our <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, If a man offend against a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that is to say, if he insult him, he is worthy to receive forty strokes with a rod; but if any one insult <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>. </p>

<p>Then came a messenger from Procle, the wife of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, to him; and the message said: Take care that you do not agree that any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should happen to Jesus the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man; because during this night I have seen fearful dreams on account of him. <span class="stiki" id="note081882"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;27:19</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> spoke to the Hebrews, saying: If you hold as insult against God the words which you declare Jesus to have spoken, take and judge him yourselves according to your law. <span class="stiki" id="note081883"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;18:31</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: We wish that you should crucify him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: This is not good.</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, turning towards the people, saw many weeping, and said: To me it seems that it is not the wish of all the people that this man should die. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> say: We on this account have brought all the people, that you might have full conviction that all wish his death. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: For what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has he done? The Hebrews said: He says that he is a king, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p>A God-fearing Jew, therefore, <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> by name, stood up in the midst, and said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: I entreat your highness to permit me to say a few words. Say on, said <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says: I, being present in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, said to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, and the people, What have you to say against this man? This man does many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, such as man has never yet done nor will do. Let him go, therefore; and if indeed what he does be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it will stand; but if from man, it will be destroyed. <span class="stiki" id="note081884"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;5:38</a></span> Just as happened also when God sent <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and Pharoah king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> told him to do a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and he did it. Then Pharoah had also two magicians, Jannes and Jambres; and they also did <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> by the use of magic art, but not such as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did. <span class="stiki" id="note081885"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;7:10-14</a></span> And the Egyptians held these magicians to be gods; but because they were not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what they did was destroyed. This Jesus, then, raised up Lazarus, and he is alive. On this account I entreat you, my lord, by no means to allow this man to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>.</p>

<p>The Hebrews were enraged against <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, and said: Mayst you receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and have a portion with him. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>; be it to me as you say.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p>And when <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> had thus spoken, another Hebrew rose up, and said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: I beg of you, my lord <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, hear me also. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> answered: Say what you wish. The Hebrew says: I lay sick in bed thirty-eight years; and when he saw me he was grieved, and said to me, Rise, take up your couch, and go into your house. And while he was saying the word to me, I rose and walked about. The Hebrews say: Ask him on what day of the week this happened. He says: On <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note081886"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;5:5-9</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: And consequently we say <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, that he does not keep the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>.</p>

<p>Another, again, standing in the midst, said: I was born blind; and as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was going along the road, I cried to him, saying, Have mercy upon me, Lord, you son of David. And he took clay, and anointed my eyes; and straightway I received my sight. <span class="stiki" id="note081887"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;9:6-7</a></span> Another said: I was crooked; and seeing him, I cried, Have mercy upon me, O Lord. And he took me by the hand, and I was immediately raised. <span class="stiki" id="note081888"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse7">Acts&nbsp;3:7</a></span> Another said: I was a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, and he healed me merely by a word. <span class="stiki" id="note081889"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;17:11-19</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p>There was found there also a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> named Veronica, and she said: Twelve years I was in an issue of blood, and I only touched the edge of his garment, and directly I was cured. <span class="stiki" id="note081890"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;9:20-22</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: Our law does not admit the testimony of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p>Other men cried: This man is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are afraid of him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: And how were the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> not at all thus afraid of your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> also? They say: We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Others, again, said: Lazarus, after having been four days in the tomb, he raised by a single word. <span class="stiki" id="note081892"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;11:43</a></span> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore, hearing of the raising of Lazarus, was afraid, and said to the people: Why do you wish to shed the blood of a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man?</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p>Then he summoned <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> and the twelve God-fearing <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and said to them: What do you say that I should do? Because the people are in commotion. They say: We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: do as you will; but what the people do, they do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, in order to kill him. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> again went outside, and said to the people: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in the feasts of unleavened bread it is customary that I free on your account one of the criminals kept in custody. I have, then, one malefactor in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, a robber named Barabbas. I have also Jesus, who has never done any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Which of the two, then, do you wish that I release to you? The people answered: Release to us Barabbas. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: What then shall I do with Jesus? They say: Let him be crucified.  Again, others of them cried out: If you release Jesus, you are no friend of C&aelig;sar, <span class="stiki" id="note081894"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;19:12</a></span> because he calls himself <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and king. And if you free him, he becomes a king, and will take C&aelig;sar's kingdom.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore was enraged, and said: Always has your nation been devilish  and unbelieving; and ever have you been adversaries to your benefactors. The Hebrews say: And who were our benefactors? <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who freed you out of the hand of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, and brought you through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> as upon dry land, and fed you with quails, and gave you water to drink out of the dry rock, and who gave you a law which, denying God you broke; and if <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had not stood and entreated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you would have perished by a bitter death. All these, then, you have forgotten. Thus also, even now, you say that I do not at all <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> C&aelig;sar, but <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him, and wish to plot against his kingdom.</p>

<p>And having thus spoken, <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> rose up from the throne with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, wishing to flee from them. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore cried out, saying: We wish C&aelig;sar to be king over us, not Jesus, because Jesus received gifts  from the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>. And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> also heard this&mdash; that there was going to be a king&mdash; and wished to put him to death, and for this purpose sent and <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> all the infants that were in <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. And on this account also his father Joseph and his mother fled from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of him into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. </p>

<p>So then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, hearing <em>this</em>, silenced all the people, and said: This, then, is the Jesus whom <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> then sought that he might put him to death? They say to him: Yes. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore, having ascertained that he was of the jurisdiction of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, as being derived of the race of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, sent Jesus to him. And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, seeing Him, rejoiced greatly, because he had been long desiring to see Him, hearing of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He did. He put on Him, therefore, white garments. Then he began to question Him. But Jesus did not give him an answer. And <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, wishing to see also some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> or other done by Jesus, and not seeing it, and also because He did not answer him a single word, sent Him back again to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>.  <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, seeing this, ordered his officers to bring water. Washing, then, his hands with the water, he said to the people: I am innocent of the blood of this <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man. See you to it, that he is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, since neither I have found a fault in him, nor <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>; for because of this he has sent him back again to me. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: His blood be upon us, and upon our children. <span class="stiki" id="note081899"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;27:25</a></span> </p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> sat down upon his throne to pass sentence. He gave order, therefore, and Jesus came before him. And they brought a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and a reed into His right hand.  Then he passed sentence, and said to Him: Your nation says, and testifies against you, that you wish to be a king. Therefore I decree that they shall beat you first with a rod forty strokes, as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the kings decree, and that they shall mock you; and finally, that they shall crucify you.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>The sentence to this effect, then, having been passed by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> began to strike Jesus, some with rods, others with <em>their</em> hands, others with <em>their</em> feet; some also spat in His face. Immediately, therefore, they got ready the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and gave it to Him, and flew to take the road. And thus going along, bearing also the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, He came as far as the gate of the city of Jerusalem. But as He, from the many blows and the weight of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, was unable to walk, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, out of the eager desire they had to crucify Him as quickly as possible, took the cross from Him, and gave it to a man that met them, Simon by name, who had also two sons, Alexander and Rufus. And he was from the city of Cyrene. <span class="stiki" id="note081901"><a href="../bible/mar015.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;15:21</a></span> They gave the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, then, to him, not because they pitied Jesus, and wished to lighten Him of the weight, but because they eagerly desired, as has been said, to put Him to death more speedily.</p>

<p>Of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, therefore, John followed Him there. Then he came fleeing to the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  and said to her: Where have you been, that you have not come to see what has happened? She answered: What is it that has happened? John says: Know that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have laid hold of my Master, and are taking Him away to crucify Him. Hearing this, His mother cried out with a loud voice, saying: My son, my son, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> then have you done, that  they are taking you away to crucify you? And she rose up as if blinded,  and goes along the road weeping. And <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> followed her&mdash; Martha, and Mary Magdalene, and Salome, and other <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. And John also was with her. When, therefore, they came to the multitude of the crowd, the mother of God says to John: Where is my son? John says: Do you see Him bearing the crown of thorns, and having His hands bound? And the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hearing this, and seeing Him, fainted, and fell backwards to the ground, and lay a considerable time. And the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, as many as followed her, stood round her, and wept. And as soon as she revived and rose up, she cried out with a loud voice: My Lord, my son, where has the beauty of your form sunk? How shall I endure to see you suffering such things? And thus saying, she tore her face with her nails, and beat her breast. Where are they gone, said she, the good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which you did in Jud&aelig;a? What <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> have you done to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, then, seeing her thus lamenting and crying, came and drove her from the road; but she would not flee, but remained, saying: Kill me first, you lawless <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>Then they got safe to the place called Cranium, which was paved with stone;  and there the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> set up the cross. Then they stripped Jesus, and the soldiers took His garments, and divided them among themselves; and they put on Him a tattered robe of scarlet, and raised Him, and drew Him up on the cross at the sixth hour of the day. After this they brought also two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, the one on His right, the other on His left.</p>

<p>Then the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, standing and looking, cried out with a loud voice, saying: My son! My son! And Jesus, turning to her, and seeing John near her, and weeping with the rest of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, said: Behold your son! Then He says also to John: Behold your mother! <span class="stiki" id="note081906"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;19:26-27</a></span> And she wept much, saying: For this I weep, my son, because you suffer <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, because the lawless <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have delivered you to a bitter death. Without you, my son, what will become of me? How shall I live without you? What sort of life shall I spend? Where are your <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who boasted that they would die with you? Where those healed by you? How has no one been found to help you? And looking to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, she said: Bend down, O cross, that I may embrace and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> my son, whom I suckled at these breasts after a strange manner, as not having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> man. Bend down, O cross; I wish to throw my arms round my son. Bend down, O cross, that I may bid farewell to my son like a mother. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, hearing these words, came forward, and drove to a distance both her and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and John.</p>

<p>Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Father, let not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> stand against them; for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.  Then He says: I thirst. And immediately there ran one of the soldiers, and took a sponge, and filled it with gall and vinegar mixed, and put it on a reed, and gave Jesus to drink. And having tasted it, He would not drink it.  And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> standing and looking on laughed at Him, and said: If you <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> say that you are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, come down from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and immediately, that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in you. Others said mocking: Others he saved, others he cured, and he healed the sick, the paralytic, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>, the blind, the lame, the dead; and himself he cannot cure. <span class="stiki" id="note081909"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;27:40-42</a></span> </p>

<p>In the same manner also, the robber crucified on His left hand said to Him: If you are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, come down and save both yourself and us. His name was Gistas. And he that was crucified on the right, Dysmas by name, reproved that robber, saying: O wretched and miserable man, do you not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God? We suffer the due punishment of what we have done; but this man has done no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> at all. And turning to Jesus, he says to Him: Lord, when You shall reign do not forget me. And He said to him: Today, I tell you <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I shall have you in paradise with me. </p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>Then Jesus, crying out with a loud voice, Father, into Your hands I shall commit my spirit, breathed His last. <span class="stiki" id="note081911"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;23:46</a></span> And immediately one could see the rocks rent: for there was an earthquake over all the earth; and from the earthquake being violent and great, the rocks also were rent. And the tombs of the dead were opened, and the curtain of the temple was rent, and there was darkness from the sixth hour till the ninth. And from all these things that had happened the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were afraid, and said: Certainly this was a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man. And Longinus, the centurion who stood by, said: Truly this was a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>. Others coming and seeing Him, beat their breasts from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and again turned back. <span class="stiki" id="note081912"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;23:44-49</a></span> </p>

<p>And the centurion having perceived all these so great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, went away and reported them to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. And when he heard, he wondered and was astonished, and from his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and grief would neither eat nor drink that day. And he sent notice, and all the Sanhedrin came to him as soon as the darkness was past; and he said to the people: You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the sun has been darkened; you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the curtain has been rent. Certainly I did well in being by no means willing to <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man. And the malefactors said to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>: This darkness is an eclipse of the sun, such as has happened also at other times. Then they say to him: We hold the feast of unleavened bread tomorrow; and we entreat you, since the crucified are still breathing, that their bones be broken, and that they be brought down. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> said: It shall be so. He therefore sent soldiers, and they found the two <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> yet breathing, and they broke their legs; but finding Jesus dead, they did not touch Him at all, except that a soldier speared Him in the right side, and immediately there came forth blood and water. <span class="stiki" id="note081913"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;19:31-34</a></span> </p>

<p>And as the <em>day of the</em> preparation  was drawing towards evening, Joseph, a man well-born and rich, a God-fearing Jew, finding <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, whose sentiments his foregoing speech had shown, says to him: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> Jesus when living, and gladly heard his words, and I saw you fighting with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> on his account. If, then, it seem good to you, let us go to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and beg the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> for burial, because it is a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for him to lie unburied. I am afraid, said <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, lest <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> should be enraged, and some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should befall me. But if you will go alone, and beg the dead, and take him, then will I also go with you, and help you to do everything necessary for the burial. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> having thus spoken, Joseph directed his eyes to heaven, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that he might not fail in his request; and he went away to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and having saluted him, sat down. Then he says to him: I entreat you, my lord, not to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me, if I shall ask anything contrary to what seems good to your highness. And he said: And what is it that you ask. Joseph says: Jesus, the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man whom through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have taken away to crucify, him I entreat that you give me for burial. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> says: And what has happened, that we should deliver to be honoured again the dead body of him against whom evidence of sorcery was brought by his nation, and who was in suspicion of taking the kingdom of C&aelig;sar, and so was given up by us to death? And Joseph, weeping and in great grief, fell at the feet of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, saying: My lord, let no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> fall upon a dead man; for all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that a man has done should perish with him in his death. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your highness, how eager you were that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> should not be crucified, and how much you said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> on his behalf, now in entreaty and again in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and at last how you washed your hands, and declare that you would by no means take part with those who wished him to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>; for all which <em>reasons</em> I entreat you not to refuse my request. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, therefore, seeing Joseph thus lying, and supplicating, and weeping, raised him up, and said: Go, I grant you this dead man; take him, and do whatever you will.</p>

<p>And then Joseph, having thanked <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and kissed his hands and his garments, went forth, rejoicing indeed in heart as having obtained his desire, but carrying tears in his eyes. Thus also, though grieved, he was glad. Accordingly he goes away to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, and discloses to him all that had happened. Then, having bought myrrh and aloes a hundred pounds, and a new tomb, <span class="stiki" id="note081915"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse60">Matthew&nbsp;27:60</a></span> they, along with the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Mary Magdalene and Salome, along with John, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, did what was customary for the body with white linen, and placed it in the tomb. <span class="stiki" id="note081916"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;19:38-42</a></span> </p>

<p>And the mother of God said, weeping: How am I not to lament you, my son? How should I not tear my face with my nails? This is that, my son, which Symeon the elder foretold to me when I brought you, an infant of forty days old, into the temple. This is the sword which now goes through my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note081917"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;2:35</a></span> Who shall put a stop to my tears, my sweetest son? No one at all except yourself alone, if, as you said, you shall rise again in three days.</p>

<p>Mary Magdalene said, weeping: Hear, O peoples, tribes, and tongues, and learn to what death the lawless <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have delivered him who did them ten thousand good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Hear, and be astonished. Who will let these things be heard by all the world? I shall go alone to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to the C&aelig;sar. I shall show him what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> has done in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the lawless <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Likewise also, Joseph lamented, saying: Ah, me! sweetest Jesus, most excellent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, if indeed it be proper to call you man, who hast wrought such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as no man has ever done. How shall I enshroud you? How shall I entomb you? There should now have been here those whom you fed with a few loaves; for thus should I not have seemed to fail in what is due.</p>

<p>Then Joseph, along with <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, went home; and likewise also the mother of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, John  also being present with them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>When the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were made acquainted with these things done by Joseph and <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, they were greatly stirred up against them. And the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> sent for Joseph, and said: Why have you done this service to Jesus? Joseph says: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was a man just, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and good in all respects; and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that you, through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, managed to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> him: and therefore I buried him. Then the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priests</a> were enraged, and laid hold of Joseph, and threw him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and said to him: If we had not tomorrow the feast of unleavened bread, tomorrow also should we have put you, like him, to death; but being kept in the meantime, early in the morning of the Lord's day  you shall be given up to death. Thus they spoke, and affixed their seal to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, having secured it by fastenings of all sorts.</p>

<p>Thus, therefore, when the Preparation was ended, early on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> went away to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, and said to him: My lord, that deceiver said, that after three days he should rise again. Lest, therefore, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should steal him by night, and lead the people astray by such deceit, order his tomb to be guarded. <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> therefore, upon this, gave them five hundred soldiers, who also sat round the sepulchre so as to guard it, after having put seals upon the stone of the tomb. <span class="stiki" id="note081920"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse62">Matthew&nbsp;27:62-66</a></span> </p>

<p>The Lord's day, then, having dawned, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, along with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, called a council, and sent to take Joseph out of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, in order to put him to death. But having opened it, they found him not. And they were astonished at this&mdash; how, with the doors shut, and the bolts safe, and the seals unbroken, Joseph had disappeared.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>And upon this there came up one of the soldiers guarding the tomb, and he said in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: Learn that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has risen. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: How? And he said: First there was an earthquake; then an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord, clothed with lightning, came from heaven, and rolled the stone from the tomb, and sat upon it. And from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of him, all of us soldiers became as dead, and were able neither to flee nor speak. And we heard the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> saying to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who came there to see the tomb: Be not you afraid, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you seek Jesus. He is not here, but is risen, as He told you before. Bend down and see the tomb where His body lay; but go and tell His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that He is risen from the dead, and let them go into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, for there shall they find Him. For this reason I tell you this first. <span class="stiki" id="note081921"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;28:1-8</a></span> </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say to the soldiers: What sort of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> were they who came to the tomb? And why did you not lay hold of them? The soldiers say: From the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and the mere sight of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, we were able neither to speak nor move. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> lives, we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> a word you say. The soldiers say: Jesus did so great wonders, and you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, and are you going to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us? You say <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> that God lives; and certainly he whom you crucified <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> lives. But we have heard that you had Joseph shut up in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and that you afterwards opened the doors, and did not find him. Do you then present Joseph, and so we also shall present Jesus. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say: Joseph, that fled from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, you will find in Arimath&aelig;a, his own country. And the soldiers say: Go you too into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and you will find Jesus, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</p>

<p>At these <em>words</em> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were afraid, and said to the soldiers: See that you tell this story to nobody, or all will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Jesus. And for this reason they gave them also much money. And the soldiers said: We are afraid lest by any chance <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> hear that we have taken money, and he will kill us. And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: Take it; and we pledge ourselves that we shall speak to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> in your defence. Only say that you were asleep, and in your slumber the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came and stole him from the tomb. The soldiers therefore took the money, and said as they were bid. And up to this day this same lying tale is told among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note081922"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;28:11-15</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>And a few days after there came from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> to Jerusalem three men. One of them was a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, by name Phinees; the second a Levite, by name Aggai; and the third a soldier, by name Adas. These came to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and said to them and to the people: Jesus, whom you crucified, we have seen in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> with his eleven <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>, teaching them, and saying, Go into all the world, and proclaim the good news; and whosoever will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be saved; but whosoever will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> shall be condemned. And having thus spoken, he went up into heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note081923"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse16">Mark&nbsp;16:16</a></span> And both we and many others of the five hundred <span class="stiki" id="note081924"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:6</a></span> besides were looking on.</p>

<p>And when the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> heard these things, they said to these three: Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and repent of these lies that you have told. They answered: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and Jacob lives, we do not lie, but tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Then the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> spoke, and they brought the old <em>covenant</em> of the Hebrews out of the temple, and he made them <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, and giving them also money, he sent them into another place, in order that they might not proclaim in Jerusalem the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>And when these stories had been heard by all the people, the crowd came together into the temple, and there was a great commotion. For many said: Jesus has risen from the dead, as we hear, and why did you crucify him? And <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> said: Do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, you <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, what the soldiers say; and do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they saw an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> coming down from heaven. For we have given money to the soldiers, in order that they should not tell such tales to any one; and thus also have the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> given them money, in order that they should say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has risen from the dead.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says: O children of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Helias went up into the height of heaven with a fiery chariot, and it is nothing incredible if Jesus too has risen; for the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Helias was a prototype of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, in order that you, hearing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has risen, might not disbelieve. I therefore say and advise, that it is befitting that we send soldiers into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, to that place where these men testify that they saw him with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, in order that they may go round about and find him, and that thus we may ask pardon of him for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which we have done to him. This proposal pleased them; and they chose soldiers, and sent them away into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>. And Jesus indeed they did not find; but they found Joseph in Arimath&aelig;a.</p>

<p>When, therefore, the soldiers had returned, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, having ascertained that Joseph was found, brought the people together, and said: What shall we do to get Joseph to come to us? After deliberating, therefore, they wrote to him a letter to the following effect:&mdash; O father Joseph, peace <em>be</em> to you and all your house, and your friends! We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have offended against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and against you His servant. On account of this, we entreat you to come here to us your children. For we have wondered much how you escaped from the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and we say in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that we had an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> design against you. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing that our designs against you were <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, has delivered you out of our hands. But come to us, for you are the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of our people.</p>

<p>This letter the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> sent to Arimath&aelig;a, with seven soldiers, friends of Joseph. And they went away and found him; and having respectfully saluted him, as they had been ordered, they gave him the letter. And after receiving it and reading it, he <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and embraced the soldiers; and having set a table, ate and drank with them during all the day and the night.</p>

<p>And on the following day he set out with them to Jerusalem; and the people came forth to meet him, and embraced him. And <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> received him into his own house. And the day after, <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, having summoned him to the temple, said to him: Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and tell us the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you buried Jesus; and on this account we laid hold of you, and locked you up in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Thereafter, when we sought to bring you out to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, we did not find you, and we were greatly astonished and afraid. Moreover, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to God that we might find you, and ask you. Tell us therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Joseph said to them: In the evening of the Preparation, when you secured me in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, I fell a-<a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> throughout the whole night, and throughout the whole day of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>. And at midnight I see the prison-house that four <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> lifted it up,  holding it by the four corners. And Jesus came in like lightning, and I fell to the ground from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Taking hold of me, therefore, by the hand, he raised me, saying, Fear not, Joseph. Thereafter, embracing me, he kissed me, and said, Turn yourself, and see who I am. Turning myself, therefore, and looking, I said, My lord, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not who you are. He says, I am Jesus, whom you buried the day before yesterday. I say to him, Show me the tomb, and then I shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. He took me, therefore, by the hand, and led me away to the tomb, which had been opened. And seeing the linen and the napkin, and recognising him, I said, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord;  and I adored him. Then taking me by the hand, and accompanied by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, he brought me to my house in Arimath&aelig;a, and said to me, Sit here for forty days; for I go to my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, in order that I may enable them fully to proclaim my resurrection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>When Joseph had thus spoken, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cried out to the people: We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had a father and mother; how can we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he is the Christ? One of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> answered and said: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, noble-minded men,  great servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and receiving <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> from the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also Symeon the elder, that he received him when he was an infant, and said to him: Now you send away Your servant, O Lord.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: Let us now find the three men that saw him on the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>, that we may question them, and learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> more accurately. They found them, and brought them before all, and made them <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And they said: As the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> lives, we saw Jesus alive on the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>, and going up into heaven.</p>

<p>Then <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas</a> and <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> took the three apart, one by one, and questioned them singly in private. They agreed with one another, therefore, and gave, even the three, one account. The chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> answered, saying: Our <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says that every word shall be established by two or three witnesses.  Joseph, then, has confessed that he, along with <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, attended to his body, and buried him, and how it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that he has risen. </p>
