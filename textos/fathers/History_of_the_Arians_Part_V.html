<h1>History of the Arians, Part V</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. ATHANASIUS</em></strong>

<h2>35. Persecution and Lapse of Liberius</h2>

<p>35. Now it had been better if from the first Constantius had never become connected with this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> at all; or being connected with it, if he had not yielded so much to those impious men; or having yielded to them, if he had stood by them only thus far, so that judgment might come upon them all for these atrocities alone. But as it would seem, like madmen, having fixed themselves in the bonds of impiety, they are drawing down upon their own heads a more severe judgment. Thus from the first  they spared not even Liberius, Bishop of Rome, but extended  their fury even to those parts; they respected not his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a>, because it was an Apostolical throne; they felt no reverence for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, because she is the Metropolis of Romania ; they remembered not that formerly in their letters they had spoken of her Bishops as Apostolical men. But confounding all things together, they at once forgot everything, and cared only to show their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in behalf of impiety. When they perceived that he was an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> man and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and earnestly endeavoured to persuade all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to renounce and withdraw from it, these impious men reasoned thus with themselves: 'If we can persuade Liberius, we shall soon prevail over all.' Accordingly they accused him <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> before the Emperor; and he, expecting easily to draw over all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to his side by means of Liberius, writes to him, and sends a certain eunuch called Eusebius with letters and offerings, to cajole him with the presents, and to threaten him with the letters. The eunuch accordingly went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and first proposed to Liberius to subscribe against Athanasius, and to hold communion with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, saying, 'The Emperor wishes it, and commands you to do so.' And then showing him the offerings, he took him by the hand, and again besought him saying, 'Obey the Emperor, and receive these.'</p>

<h2>36. The Eunuch Eusebius attempts Liberius in vain</h2>

<p>But the Bishop endeavoured to convince him, reasoning with him thus: 'How is it possible for me to do this against Athanasius? How can we condemn a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whom not one  Council only, but a second  assembled from all parts of the world, has fairly acquitted, and whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Romans dismissed in peace? Who will approve of our conduct, if we reject in his absence one, whose presence  among us we gladly welcomed, and admitted him to our communion? This is no Ecclesiastical Canon; nor have we had transmitted to us any such tradition  from the Fathers, who in their turn received from the great and blessed Apostle Peter.  But if the Emperor is really concerned for the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if he requires our letters respecting Athanasius to be reversed, let their proceedings both against him and against all the others be reversed also; and then let an Ecclesiastical Council be called at a distance from the Court, at which the Emperor shall not be present, nor any Count be admitted, nor magistrate to threaten us, but where only the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the Apostolical rule  shall prevail; that so in the first place, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may be secure, as the Fathers defined it in the Council of Nic&aelig;a, and the supporters of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> doctrines may be cast out, and their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a>. And then after that, an enquiry being made into the charges brought against Athanasius, and any other besides, as well as into those things of which the other party is accused, let the culprits be cast out, and the innocent receive encouragement and support. For it is impossible that they who maintain an impious creed can be admitted as members of a Council: nor is it fit that an enquiry into matters of conduct should precede the enquiry concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ; but all diversity of opinions on points of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought first to be eradicated, and then the enquiry made into matters of conduct. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a> did not heal them that were afflicted, until they showed and declared what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they had in Him. These things we have received from the Fathers; these report to the Emperor; for they are both profitable for him and edifying to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But let not Ursacius and Valens be listened to, for they have retracted their former assertions, and in what they now say they are not to be trusted.'</p>

<h2>37. Liberius refuses the Emperor's offering</h2>

<p>These were the words of the Bishop Liberius. And the eunuch, who was vexed, not so much because he would not subscribe, as because he found him an enemy to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, forgetting that he was in the presence of a Bishop, after threatening him severely, went away with the offerings; and next commits an offense, which is foreign to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and too audacious for a eunuch. In imitation of the transgression of Saul, he went to the Martyry  of the Apostle Peter, and then presented the offerings. But Liberius having notice of it, was very <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the person who kept the place, that he had not prevented him, and cast out the offerings as an unlawful <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, which increased the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of the mutilated creature against him. Consequently he exasperates the Emperor against him, saying, 'The matter that concerns us is no longer the obtaining the subscription of Liberius, but the fact that he is so resolutely opposed to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, that he <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> by name.' He also stirs up the other eunuchs to say the same; for many of those who were about Constantius, or rather the whole number of them, are eunuchs , who engross all the influence with him, and it is impossible to do anything there without them. The Emperor accordingly writes to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and again Palatines, and Notaries, and Counts are sent off with letters to the Prefect, in order that either they may inveigle Liberius by stratagem away from Rome and send him to the Court to him, or else <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> him by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>.</p>

<h2>38. The evil influence of Eunuchs at Court</h2>

<p>Such being the tenor of the letters, there also <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and treachery immediately became rife throughout the whole city. How many were the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> against which threats were held out! How many received great promises on condition of their acting against Liberius! How many Bishops hid themselves when they saw these things! How many noble <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> retired to country places in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of the enemies of Christ! How many <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a> were made the objects of their plots! How many who were sojourning there, and had made that place their home, did they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>! How often and how strictly did they guard the harbour  and the approaches to the gates, lest any <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> person should enter and visit Liberius! Rome also had trial of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and now experienced what before she would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, when she heard how the other Churches in every city were ravaged by them. It was the eunuchs who instigated these proceedings against all. And the most remarkable circumstance in the matter is this; that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which denies the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, receives its support from eunuchs, who, as both their bodies are fruitless, and their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> barren of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, cannot bear even to hear the name of son. The Eunuch of <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> indeed, though he understood not what he read <span class="stiki" id="note281634"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse27">Acts&nbsp;8:27</a></span>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the words of Philip, when he taught him concerning the Saviour; but the eunuchs of Constantius cannot endure the confession of Peter , nay, they turn away when the Father manifests the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and madly rage against those who say, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is His genuine Son, thus claiming as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of eunuchs, that there is no genuine and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> offspring of the Father. On these grounds it is that the law forbids such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be admitted into any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Council ; notwithstanding which they have now regarded these as competent judges of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> causes, and whatever seems good to them, that Constantius decrees, while men with the name of Bishops dissemble with them. Oh! Who shall be their historian? Who shall transmit the record of these things to another generation? Who indeed would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, were he to hear it, that eunuchs who are scarcely entrusted with household services (for theirs is a pleasure-loving race, that has no serious concern but that of hindering in others what nature has taken from them); that these, I say, now exercise authority in <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> matters, and that Constantius in submission to their will treacherously conspired against all, and banished Liberius!</p>

<h2>39. Liberius's speech to Constantius</h2>

<p>For after the Emperor had frequently written to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had threatened, sent commissioners, devised schemes, on the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>  subsequently breaking out at Alexandria, Liberius is dragged before him, and uses great boldness of speech towards him. 'Cease,' he said, 'to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; attempt not by my means to introduce impiety into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. We are ready to suffer anything rather than to be called <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> madmen. We are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; compel us not to become enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. We also give you this counsel: fight not against Him who gave you this empire, nor show impiety towards Him instead of thankfulness  ;' <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> not them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, lest you also hear the words, 'It is hard for you to kick against the pricks <span class="stiki" id="note281639"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;9:5</a></span>.' Nay, I would that you might hear them, that you might <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did. Behold, here we are; we have come, before they fabricate charges. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we hastened hither, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that banishment awaits us at your hands, that we might suffer before a charge encounters us, and that all may clearly see that all the others too have suffered as we shall suffer, and that the charges brought against them were fabrications of their enemies, and all their proceedings were mere <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.'</p>

<h2>40. Banishment of Liberius and others</h2>

<p>These were the words of Liberius at that time, and he was admired by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> for them. But the Emperor instead of answering , only gave orders for their banishment, separating each of them from the rest, as he had done in the former cases. For he had himself devised this plan in the banishments which he inflicted, that so the severity of his punishments might be greater than that of former tyrants and persecutors.  In the former <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> Maximian, who was then Emperor, commanded a number of Confessors to be banished together , and thus lightened their punishment by the consolation which he gave them in each other's society. But this man was more savage than he; he separated those who had spoken boldly and confessed together, he put asunder those who were united by the bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that when they came to die they might not see one another; thinking that bodily separation can disunite also the affections of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and that being severed from each other, they would forget the concord and unanimity which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among them. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that however each one may remain  apart from the rest, he has nevertheless with him that Lord, whom they confessed in one body together, who will also provide (as he did in the case of the Prophet Elisha <span class="stiki" id="note281644"><a href="../bible/2ki006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;6:16</a></span>) that more shall be with each of them, than there are soldiers with Constantius. Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> iniquity is blind; for in that they thought to afflict the Confessors, by separating them from one another, they rather brought thereby a great injury upon themselves. For had they continued in each other's company, and abode together, the pollutions of those impious men would have been proclaimed from one place only; but now by putting them asunder, they have made their impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to spread abroad and become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in every place. </p>

<h2>41. Lapse of Liberius</h2>

<p>Who that shall hear what they did in the course of these proceedings will not think them to be anything rather than <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? When Liberius sent Eutropius, a Presbyter, and Hilarius, a Deacon, with letters to the Emperor, at the time that Lucifer and his fellows made their confession, they banished the Presbyter on the spot, and after stripping Hilarius  the Deacon and scourging him on the back, they banished him too, clamouring at him, 'Why did you not resist Liberius instead of being the bearer of letters from him.' Ursacius and Valens, with the eunuchs who sided with them, were the authors of this outrage. The Deacon, while he was being scourged, praised the Lord, remembering His words, 'I gave My back to the smiters <span class="stiki" id="note281647"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;50:6</a></span>;' but they while they scourged him laughed and mocked him, feeling no shame that they were insulting a Levite. Indeed they acted but consistently in laughing while he continued to praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is the part of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to endure stripes, but to scourge <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is the outrage of a <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> or a <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>. Thus they endeavoured at the first to corrupt the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Romans, wishing to introduce impiety into it as well as others. But Liberius after he had been in banishment two years gave way, and from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of threatened death subscribed. Yet even this only shows their violent conduct, and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of Liberius against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and his support of Athanasius, so long as he was suffered to exercise a free choice. For that which men are forced by torture to do contrary to their first judgment, ought not to be considered the willing deed of those who are in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but rather of their tormentors. They however attempted everything in support of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, while the people in every Church, preserving the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they had learned, waited for the return of their teachers, and condemned the Antichristian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and all avoid it, as they would a serpent.</p>
