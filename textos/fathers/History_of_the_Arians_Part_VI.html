<h1>History of the Arians, Part VI</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. ATHANASIUS</em></strong>

<h2>42. Persecution and Lapse of Hosius</h2>

<p>But although they had done all this, yet these impious men thought they had accomplished nothing, so long as the great Hosius escaped their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> machinations. And now they undertook to extend their fury  to that great old man. They felt no shame at the thought that he is the father  of the Bishops; they regarded not that he had been a Confessor ; they reverenced not the length of his Episcopate, in which he had continued more than sixty years; but they set aside everything, and looked only to the interests of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, as being of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> such as neither <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor regard man. <span class="stiki" id="note281651"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;18:2</a></span> Accordingly they went to Constantius, and again employed such arguments as the following: 'We have done everything; we have banished the Bishop of the Romans; and before him a very great number of other Bishops, and have filled every place with alarm. But these strong measures of yours are as nothing to us, nor is our success at all more secure, so long as Hosius remains. While he is in his own place, the rest also continue in their Churches, for he is able by his arguments and his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to persuade all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> against us. He is the president of Councils , and his letters are everywhere attended to. He it was who put forth the Nicene Confession, and proclaimed everywhere that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> were <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. If therefore he is suffered to remain, the banishment of the rest is of no avail, for our <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> will be destroyed. Begin then to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> him also and spare him not, ancient as he is. Our <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> even the hoary hairs of the aged.'</p>

<h2>43. Brave resistance of Hosius</h2>

<p>Upon hearing this, the Emperor no longer delayed, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the man, and the dignity of his years, wrote to summon him. This was when he first  began his attempt upon Liberius. Upon his arrival he desired him, and urged him with the usual arguments, with which he thought also to deceive the others, that he would subscribe against us, and hold communion with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. But the old man, scarcely bearing to hear the words, and grieved that he had even ventured to utter such a proposal, severely rebuked him, and after gaining his consent, withdrew to his own country and Church. But the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> still complaining, and instigating him to proceed (he had the eunuchs also to remind him and to urge him further), the Emperor again wrote in threatening terms; but still Hosius, while he endured their insults, was unmoved by any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of their designs against him, and remaining firm to his purpose, as one who had built the house of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> upon the rock, he spoke boldly against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, regarding the threats held out to him in the letters but as drops of rain and blasts of wind. And although Constantius wrote frequently, sometimes flattering him with the title of Father, and sometimes threatening and recounting the names of those who had been banished, and saying, 'Will you continue the only person to oppose the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>? Be persuaded and subscribe against Athanasius; for whoever subscribes against him thereby embraces with us the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>;' still Hosius remained fearless, and while suffering these insults, wrote an answer in such terms as these. We have read the letter, which is placed at the end. </p>

<h2>44. 'Hosius to Constantius the Emperor sends health in the Lord.'</h2>

<p>I was a Confessor at the first, when a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> arose in the time of your grandfather Maximian; and if you shall <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> me, I am ready now, too, to endure anything rather than to shed innocent blood and to betray the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But I cannot approve of your conduct in writing after this threatening manner. Cease to write thus; adopt not the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, nor listen to those in the East, nor give credit to Ursacius, Valens and their fellows. For whatever they assert, it is not on account of Athanasius, but for the sake of their own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Believe my statement, O Constantius, who am of an age to be your grandfather. I was present at the Council of Sardica, when you and your brother Constans of blessed memory assembled us all together; and on my own account I challenged the enemies of Athanasius, when they came to the church where I abode , that if they had anything against him they might declare it; desiring them to have confidence, and not to expect otherwise than that a right judgment would be passed in all things. This I did once and again, requesting them, if they were unwilling to appear before the whole Council, yet to appear before me alone; promising them also, that if he should be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> guilty, he should certainly be rejected by us; but if he should be found to be blameless, and should prove them to be <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>, that if they should then refuse to hold communion with him, I would persuade him to go with me into the Spains. Athanasius was willing to comply with these conditions, and made no objection to my proposal; but they, altogether distrusting their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, would not consent. And on another occasion Athanasius came to your Court , when you wrote for him, and his enemies being at the time in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, he requested that they might be summoned either altogether or separately, in order that they might either convict  him, or be convicted , and might either in his presence prove him to be what they represented, or cease to accuse him when absent. To this proposal also you would not listen, and they equally rejected it. Why then do you still give ear to them that speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of him? How can you endure Valens and Ursacius, although they have retracted and made a written confession of their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> ? For it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as they pretend, that they were forced to confess; there were no soldiers at hand to influence them; your brother was not cognizant of the matter.  No, such things were not done under his government, as are done now; God forbid. But they voluntarily went up to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and in the presence of the Bishop and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> wrote their recantation, having previously addressed to Athanasius a friendly and peaceable letter. And if they pretend that force was employed towards them, and acknowledge that this is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing, which you also disapprove of; then do you cease to use force; write no letters, send no Counts; but release those that have been banished, lest while you are complaining of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, they do but exercise greater <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. When was any such thing done by Constans? What Bishop suffered banishment? When did he appear as arbiter of an Ecclesiastical trial? When did any Palatine of his compel men to subscribe against any one, that Valens and his fellows should be able to affirm this? Cease these proceedings, I beseech you, and remember that you are a mortal man. Be afraid of the day of judgment, and keep yourself pure thereunto. Intrude not yourself into Ecclesiastical matters, neither give commands unto us concerning them; but learn them from us. God has put into your hands the kingdom; to us He has entrusted the affairs of His Church; and as he who would steal the empire from you would resist the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so likewise <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> on your part lest by taking upon yourself the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, you become guilty of a great offense. It is written, <q>Render unto C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's, and unto God the things that are God's <span class="stiki" id="note281660"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;22:21</a></span> .</q> Neither therefore is it permitted unto us to exercise an earthly rule, nor have you, Sire, any authority to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>.  These things I write unto you out of a concern for your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. With regard to the subject of your letters, this is my determination; I will not unite myself to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; I <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Neither will I subscribe against Athanasius, whom both we and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Romans and the whole Council pronounced to be guiltless. And yourself also, when you understood this, sent for the man, and gave him permission to return with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to his country and his Church. What reason then can there be for so great a change in your conduct? The same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were his enemies before, are so now also; and the things they now whisper to his prejudice (for they do not declare them openly in his presence), the same they spoke against him, before you sent for him; the same they spread abroad concerning him when they come to the Council. And when I required them to come forward, as I have before said, they were unable to produce their <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>; had they possessed any, they would not have fled so disgracefully. Who then persuaded you so long after to forget your own letters and declarations? Forbear, and be not influenced by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, lest while you act for the mutual advantage of yourself and them, you render yourself responsible. For here you comply with their desires, hereafter in the judgment you will have to answer for doing so alone. These men desire by your means to injure their enemy, and wish to make you the minister of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, in order that through your help they may sow the seeds  of their accursed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Now it is not a <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> thing to cast one's self into manifest danger for the pleasure of others. Cease then, I beseech you, O Constantius, and be persuaded by me. These things it becomes me to write, and you not to despise.'</p>

<h2>45. Lapse of Hosius, due to cruel persecution</h2>

<p>Such were the sentiments, and such the letter, of the Abraham-like old man, Hosius, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> so called.  But the Emperor desisted not from his designs, nor ceased to seek an occasion against him; but continued to threaten him severely, with a view either to bring him over by force, or to banish him if he refused to comply. And as the Officers and Satraps of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> <span class="stiki" id="note281664"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm#verse5">Daniel&nbsp;6:5</a></span>, seeking an occasion against Daniel, found none except in the law of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so likewise these present Satraps of impiety were unable to invent any charge against the old man (for this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Hosius, and his blameless life were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all), except the charge of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. They therefore proceeded to accuse him; though not under the same circumstances as those others accused Daniel to Darius, for Darius was grieved to hear the charge, but as <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> accused Naboth, and as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> applied themselves to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>. And they said, 'He not only will not subscribe against Athanasius, but also on his account condemns us; and his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is so great, that he also writes to others, that they should rather suffer death, than become traitors to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For, he says, our beloved Athanasius also is <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for the Truth's sake, and Liberius, Bishop of Rome, and all the rest, are treacherously assailed.' When this patron of impiety, and Emperor of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> , Constantius, heard this, and especially that there were others also in the Spains of the same mind as Hosius, after he had tempted them also to subscribe, and was unable to compel them to do so, he sent for Hosius, and instead of banishing him, detained him a whole year in Sirmium. Godless, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>, without natural affection, he feared not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he regarded not his father's affection for Hosius, he reverenced not his great age, for he was now a hundred years old ; but all these things this modern Ahab, this second Belshazzar of our times, disregarded for the sake of impiety. He used such <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> towards the old man, and confined him so tightly, that at last, broken by suffering, he was brought, though hardly, to hold communion with Valens, Ursacius, and their fellows, though he would not subscribe against Athanasius. Yet even thus he forgot not his duty, for at the approach of death, as it were by his last testament, he bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the force which had been used towards him, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and gave strict charge that no one should receive it.</p>

<h2>46. Arbitrary expulsion of so many bishops</h2>

<p>Who that witnessed these things, or that has merely heard of them, will not be greatly amazed, and cry aloud unto the Lord, saying, 'Will You make a full end of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note281667"><a href="../bible/eze011.htm#verse13">Ezekiel&nbsp;11:13</a></span>?' Who that is acquainted with these proceedings, will not with good reason cry out and say, 'A wonderful and horrible thing is done in the land;' and, 'The heavens are astonished at this, and the earth is even more horribly afraid. ' The fathers of the people and the teachers of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are taken away, and the impious are brought into the Churches? Who that saw when Liberius, Bishop of Rome, was banished, and when the great Hosius, the father  of the Bishops, suffered these things, or who that saw so many Bishops banished out of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and the other parts, could fail to perceive, however little sense he might possess, that the charges  against Athanasius also and the rest were false, and altogether mere <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>? For this reason those others also endured all suffering, because they saw plainly that the conspiracies laid against these were founded in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. For what charge was there against Liberius? Or what accusation against the aged Hosius? Who bore even a false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against Paulinus, and Lucifer, and Dionysius, and Eusebius? Or what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> could be lain to the account of the rest of the banished Bishops, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a>, and Deacons? None whatever; God forbid. There were no charges against them on which a plot for their ruin might be formed; nor was it on the ground of any accusation that they were severally banished. It was an insurrection of impiety against godliness; it was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and a prelude to the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, for whom Constantius is thus preparing the way.</p>
