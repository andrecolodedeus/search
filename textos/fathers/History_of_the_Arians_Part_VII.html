<h1>History of the Arians, Part VII</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. ATHANASIUS</em></strong>

<h2>47. Persecution at Alexandria</h2>

<p>'After' he had accomplished all that he desired against the Churches in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, and the other parts; after he had banished some, and violently oppressed others, and filled every place with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he at last turned his fury, as it had been some pestilential disorder, against Alexandria. This was artfully contrived by the enemies of Christ; for in order that they might have a show of the signatures of many Bishops, and that Athanasius might not have a single Bishop in his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> to whom he could even complain, they therefore anticipated his proceedings, and filled every place with terror, which they kept up to second them in the prosecution of their designs. But herein they perceived not through their folly that they were not exhibiting the deliberate choice of the Bishops, but rather the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> which themselves had employed; and that, although his brethren should desert him, and his friends and acquaintance stand afar off, and no one be found to sympathise with him and console him, yet far above all these, a refuge with his God was sufficient for him. For Elijah also was alone in his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and God was all in all to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man. And the Saviour has given us an example herein, who also was left alone, and exposed to the designs of His enemies, to teach us, that when we are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and deserted by men, we must not faint, but place our hope in Him, and not betray the Truth. For although at first <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may seem to be afflicted, yet even they who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> shall afterwards acknowledge it.</p>

<h2>48. Attacks upon the Alexandrian Church</h2>

<p>Accordingly they urge on the Emperor, who first writes a menacing letter, which he sends to the Duke and the soldiers. The Notaries Diogenius and Hilarius , and certain Palatines with them, were the bearers of it; upon whose arrival those terrible and cruel outrages were committed against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which I have briefly related a little above , and which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from the protests put forth by the people, which are inserted at the end of this history, so that any one may read them. Then after these proceedings on the part of Syrianus, after these enormities had been perpetrated, and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> offered to the Virgins, as approving of such conduct and the infliction of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> upon us, he writes again to the senate and people of Alexandria, instigating the younger men, and requiring them to assemble together, and either to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Athanasius, or consider themselves as his enemies. He however had withdrawn before these instructions reached them, and from the time when Syrianus broke into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for he remembered that which was written, 'Hide yourself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast <span class="stiki" id="note281673"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;26:20</a></span>.' One Heraclius, by rank a Count, was the bearer of this letter, and the precursor of a certain George that was dispatched by the Emperor as a spy, for one that was sent from him cannot be a Bishop ; God forbid. And so indeed his conduct and the circumstances which preceded his entrance sufficiently prove.</p>

<h2>49 and 50. Hypocrisy of the pretended respect of Constantius for his brother's memory</h2>

<p>Heraclius then published the letter, which reflected great disgrace upon the writer. For whereas, when the great Hosius wrote to Constantius, he had been unable to make out any plausible pretext for his change of conduct, he now invented an excuse much more discreditable to himself and his advisers. He said, 'From regard to the affection I entertained towards my brother of divine and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, I endured for a time the coming of Athanasius among you.' This proves that he has both broken his promise, and behaved ungratefully to his brother after his death. He then declares him to be, as indeed he is, 'deserving of divine and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> remembrance;' yet as regards a command of his, or to use his own language, the 'affection' he bore him, even though he complied merely 'for the sake' of the blessed Constans, he ought to deal fairly by his brother, and make himself heir to his sentiments as well as to the Empire. But, although, when seeking to obtain his just rights, he deposed Vetranio, with the question, 'To whom does the inheritance belong after a brother's death ?' yet for the sake of the accursed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he disregards the claims of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and behaves undutifully towards his brethren. Nay, for the sake of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, he would not consent to observe even his father's wishes without infringement; but, in what he may gratify these impious men, he pretends to adopt his intention, while in order to distress the others, he cares not to show the reverence which is due unto a father. For in consequence of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of Eusebius and his fellows, his father sent the Bishop for a time into <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> to avoid the cruelty of his persecutors (this was shown by the blessed Constantine, the brother of the former, after their father's death, as appears by his letters ), but he would not be persuaded by Eusebius and his fellows to send the person whom they desired for a Bishop, but prevented the accomplishment of their wishes, and put a stop to their attempts with severe threats.</p>

<h2>51. How Constantius shows his respect for his father and brother</h2>

<p>If therefore, as he declares in his letters, he desired to observe his sire's practice, why did he first send out Gregory, and now this George, the eater of stores ? Why does he endeavour so earnestly to introduce into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> these <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, whom his father named Porphyrians , and banish others while he patronises them? Although his father admitted <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> to his presence, yet when <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjured</a> himself and burst asunder  he lost the compassion of his father; who, on learning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, condemned him as an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Why moreover, while pretending to respect the Canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has he ordered the whole course of his conduct in opposition to them? For where is there a Canon that a Bishop should be appointed from Court? Where is there a Canon  that permits soldiers to invade Churches? What tradition is there allowing counts and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> eunuchs to exercise authority in Ecclesiastical matters, and to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their edicts the decisions of those who bear the name of Bishops? He is guilty of all manner of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> for the sake of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. At a former time he sent out Philagrius as Prefect a second time , in opposition to the opinion of his father, and we see what has taken place now. Nor 'for his brother's sake' does he speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For after his death he wrote not once nor twice, but three times to the Bishop, and repeatedly promised him that he would not change his behaviour towards him, but exhorted him to be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and not suffer any one to alarm him, but to continue to abide in his Church in perfect security. He also sent his commands by Count Asterius, and Palladius the Notary, to Felicissimus, who was then Duke, and to the Prefect <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, that if either Philip the Prefect, or any other should venture to form any plot against Athanasius, they should prevent it.</p>

<h2>52. The Emperor has no right to rule the Church</h2>

<p>Wherefore when Diogenes came, and Syrianus laid in wait for us, both he and we  and the people demanded to see the Emperor's letters, supposing that, as it is written, 'Let not a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> be spoken before the king ;' so when a king has made a promise, he will not lie, nor change. If then 'for his brother's sake he complied,' why did he also write those letters upon his death? And if he wrote them for 'his memory's sake,' why did he afterwards behave so very unkindly towards him, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the man, and write what he did, alleging a judgment of Bishops, while in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he acted only to please himself? Nevertheless his craft has not escaped detection, but we have the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of it ready at hand. For if a judgment had been passed by Bishops, what concern had the Emperor with it? Or if it was only a threat of the Emperor, what need in that case was there of the so-named Bishops? When was such a thing heard of before from the beginning of the world? When did a judgment of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> receive its validity from the Emperor? Or rather when was his decree ever recognised by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? There have been many Councils held heretofore; and many judgments passed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but the Fathers never sought the consent of the Emperor thereto, nor did the Emperor busy himself with the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> had friends among them of C&aelig;sar's household, and in his Epistle to the Philippians he sent salutations from them; but he never took them as his associates in Ecclesiastical judgments. Now however we have witnessed a novel spectacle, which is a discovery of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Heretics have assembled together with the Emperor Constantius, in order that he, alleging the authority of the Bishops, may exercise his power against whomsoever he pleases, and while he persecutes may avoid the name of persecutor; and that they, supported by the Emperor's government, may conspire the ruin of whomsoever they will  and these are all such as are not as impious as themselves. One might look upon their proceedings as a comedy which they are performing on the stage, in which the pretended Bishops are actors, and Constantius the performer of their behests, who makes promises to them, as <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> did to the daughter of <a href="../cathen/07292a.htm">Herodias</a>, and they dancing before him accomplish through false accusations the banishment and death of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in the Lord.</p>

<h2>53. Despotic interference of Constantius</h2>

<p>Who indeed has not been injured by their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>? Whom have not these enemies of Christ conspired to destroy? Whom has Constantius failed to banish upon charges which they have brought against them? When did he refuse to hear them willingly? And what is most strange, when did he permit any one to speak against them, and did not more readily receive their testimony, of whatever kind it might be? Where is there a Church which now enjoys the privilege of worshipping Christ freely? If a Church be a maintainer of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, it is in danger; if it dissemble, it abides in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Every place is full of hypocrisy and impiety, so far as he is concerned; and wherever there is a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> person and a lover of Christ (and there are many such everywhere, as were the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the great Elijah) they hide themselves, if so be that they can find a faithful friend like Obadiah, and either they withdraw into caves and dens of the earth, or pass their lives in wandering about in the deserts. These men in their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> prefer such <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against them as <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> invented against Naboth, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against the Saviour; while the Emperor, who is the patron of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and wishes to pervert the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as Ahab wished to change the vineyard into a garden of herbs, does whatever they desire him to do, for the suggestions he receives from them are agreeable to his own wishes.</p>

<h2>54. Constantius gives up the Alexandrian Churches to the heretics</h2>

<p>Accordingly he banished, as I said before the genuine Bishops, because they would not profess impious doctrines, to suit his own pleasure; and so he now sent Count Heraclius to proceed against Athanasius, who has publicly made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his decrees, and announced the command of the Emperor to be, that unless they complied with the instructions contained in his letters, their bread  should be taken away, their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> overthrown, and the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of many of the city-magistrates and people delivered over to certain slavery. After threatening them in this manner, he was not ashamed to declare publicly with a loud voice, 'The Emperor disclaims Athanasius, and has commanded that the Churches be given up to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>.' And when all wondered to hear this, and made signs to one another, exclaiming, 'What! Has Constantius become a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>?' instead of blushing as he ought, the man all the more <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> the senators and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> magistrates and wardens  of the idol temples to subscribe to these conditions, and to agree to receive as their Bishop whomsoever  the Emperor should send them. Of course Constantius was strictly upholding the Canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when he caused this to be done; when instead of requiring letters from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he demanded them of the market-place, and instead of the people he asked them of the wardens of the temples. He was conscious that he was not sending a Bishop to preside over <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, but a certain intruder for those who subscribed to his terms.</p>

<h2>55. Irruption into the great Church</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> accordingly, as purchasing by their compliance the safety of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and certain of the trades , subscribed, though unwillingly, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the threats which he had held out to them; just as if the matter had been the appointment of a general, or other magistrate. Indeed what as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, were they likely to do, except whatever was pleasing to the Emperor? But the people having assembled in the great Church (for it was the fourth day of the week), Count Heraclius on the following day  takes with him Cataphronius the Prefect of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and Faustinus the Receiver-General , and Bithynus a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; and together they stir up the younger men of the common multitude  who worshipped <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, to attack the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and stone the people, saying that such was the Emperor's command. As the time of dismissal however had arrived, the greater part had already left the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but there being a few <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> still remaining, they did as the men had charged them, whereupon a piteous spectacle ensued. The few <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> had just risen from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and had sat down when the youths suddenly came upon them naked with stones and clubs. Some of them the godless wretches <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned to death</a>; they scourged with stripes the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the Virgins, tore off their veils and exposed their heads, and when they resisted the insult, the cowards kicked them with their feet. This was dreadful, exceedingly dreadful; but what ensued was worse, and more intolerable than any outrage. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> character of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and that their ears were unaccustomed to pollution, and that they were better able to bear stones and swords than expressions of obscenity, they assailed them with such language. This the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> suggested to the young men, and laughed at all they said and did; while the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgins and other godly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> fled from such words as they would from the bite of asps, but the enemies of Christ assisted them in the work, nay even, it may be, gave utterance to the same; for they were well-pleased with the obscenities which the youths vented upon them.</p>

<h2>56. The great Church pillaged</h2>

<p>After this, that they might fully execute the orders they had received (for this was what they earnestly desired, and what the Count and the Receiver-General instructed them to do), they seized upon the seats, the throne, and the table which was of wood , and the curtains  of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and whatever else they were able, and carrying them out burnt them before the doors in the great street, and cast frankincense upon the flame. Alas! Who will not weep to hear of these things, and, it may be, close his ears, that he may not have to endure the recital, esteeming it hurtful merely to listen to the account of such enormities? Moreover they sang the praises of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and said, 'Constantius has become a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> have acknowledged our customs;' for indeed they scruple not even to pretend <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>, if only their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> may be established. They even were ready to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> a heifer which drew the water for the gardens in the C&aelig;sareum ; and would have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> it, had it not been a female ; for they said that it was unlawful for such to be offered among them.</p>

<p>57. Thus acted the impious  <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> in conjunction with the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, thinking that these things tended to our dishonour. But Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> reproved their iniquity, and wrought a great and remarkable sign, thereby plainly showing to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that as in their acts of impiety they had dared to attack none other but the Lord, so in these proceedings also they were again attempting to do dishonour unto Him. This was more manifestly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the marvellous event which now came to pass. One of these licentious youths ran into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and ventured to sit down upon the throne; and as he sat there the wretched man uttered with a nasal sound some lascivious song. Then rising up he attempted to pull away the throne, and to drag it towards him; he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that he was drawing down vengeance upon himself. For as of old the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/02169a.htm">Azotus</a>, when they ventured to touch  the Ark, which it was not lawful for them even to look upon, were immediately destroyed by it, being first grievously tormented by emerods; so this unhappy person who presumed to drag the throne, drew it upon himself, and, as if Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> had sent the wood to punish him, he struck it into his own bowels; and instead of carrying out the throne, he brought out by his blow his own entrails; so that the throne took away his life, instead of his taking it away. For, as it is <span class="stiki" id="note281699"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse18">Acts&nbsp;1:18</a></span> written of Judas, his bowels gushed out; and he fell down and was carried away, and the day after he died. Another also entered the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with boughs of trees  and, as in the Gentile manner he waved them in his hands and mocked, he was immediately struck with blindness, so as straightway to lose his sight, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no longer where he was; but as he was about to fall, he was taken by the hand and supported by his companions out of the place, and when on the following day he was with difficulty brought to his senses, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not either what he had done or suffered in consequence of his audacity.</p>

<h2>58. General Persecution at Alexandria</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, when they beheld these things, were seized with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and ventured on no further outrage; but the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> were not even yet touched with shame, but, like the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> when they saw the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, were faithless and would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, nay, like <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, they were hardened; they too having placed their hopes below, on the Emperor and his eunuchs. They permitted the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, or rather the more abandoned of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, to act in the manner before described; for they found that Faustinus, who is the Receiver-General by style, but is a vulgar  person in habits, and profligate in heart, was ready to play his part with them in these proceedings, and to stir up the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. Nay, they undertook to do the like themselves, that as they had modelled their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> upon all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> together , so they might share their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> with the more depraved of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. What they did through the instrumentality of others I described above; the enormities they committed themselves surpass the bounds of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; and they exceed the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of any hangman. Where is there a house which they did not ravage? Where is there a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> they did not plunder on pretence of searching for their opponents? Where is there a garden they did not trample under foot? What tomb  did they not open, pretending they were seeking for Athanasius, though their sole object was to plunder and spoil all that came in their way? How many men's houses were sealed up!  The contents of how many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons'</a> lodgings did they give away to the soldiers who assisted  them! Who had not experience of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? Who that met them but was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to hide himself in the market-place? Did not many an one leave his house from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of them, and pass the night in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>? Did not many an one, while anxious to preserve his property from them, lose the greater part of it? And who, however inexperienced of the sea, did not choose rather to commit himself to it, and to risk all its dangers, than to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> their threatenings? Many also changed their residences, and removed from street to street, and from the city to the suburbs. And many submitted to severe fines, and when they were unable to pay, borrowed of others, merely that they might escape their machinations.</p>

<h2>59. Violence of Sebastianus</h2>

<p>For they made themselves formidable to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and treated all with great arrogance, using the name of the Emperor, and threatening them with his displeasure. They had to assist them in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> the Duke Sebastianus, a Manichee, and a profligate young man; the  Prefect, the Count, and the Receiver-General as a dissembler. Many Virgins who condemned their impiety, and professed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they brought out from the houses; others they insulted as they walked along the streets, and caused their heads to be uncovered by their young men. They also gave permission to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a> of their party to insult whom they chose; and although the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and faithful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> withdrew on one side, and gave them the way, yet they gathered round them like Bacchanals and Furies , and esteemed it a misfortune if they found no means to injure them, and spent that day sorrowfully on which they were unable to do them some mischief. In a word, so cruel and bitter were they against all, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> called them hangmen, murderers, lawless, intruders, evil-doers, and by any other name rather than that of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<h2>60. Martyrdom of Eutychius</h2>

<p>Moreover, imitating the savage practices of Scythians, they seized upon Eutychius a Subdeacon, a man who had served the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> honourably, and causing him to be scourged on the back with a leather whip, till he was at the point of death, they demanded that her should be sent away to the mines; and not simply to any mine, but to that of Ph&aelig;no , where even a condemned murderer is hardly able to live a few days. And what was most unreasonable in their conduct, they would not permit him even a few hours to have his wounds dressed, but caused him to be sent off immediately, saying, 'If this is done, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> will be afraid, and henceforward will be on our side.' After a short interval, however, being unable to accomplish his journey to the mine on account of the pain of his stripes, he died on the way. He perished rejoicing, having obtained the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. But the miscreants were not even yet ashamed, but in the words of Scripture, 'having bowels without mercy <span class="stiki" id="note281708"><a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;12:10</a></span>,' they acted accordingly, and now again perpetrated a satanic deed. When the people <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> them to spare Eutychius and besought them for him, they caused four <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and free citizens to be seized, one of whom was Hermias who washed the beggars' feet ; and after scourging them very severely, the Duke cast them into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, who are more cruel even than Scythians, when they had seen that they did not die from the stripes they had received, complained of the Duke and threatened, saying, 'We will write and tell the eunuchs , that he does not flog as we wish.' Hearing this he was afraid, and was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to beat the men a second time; and they being beaten, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> for what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> they suffered and by whom they had been accused, said only, 'We are beaten for the sake of the Truth, but we will not hold communion with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>: beat us now as you will; God will judge you for this.' The impious men wished to expose them to danger in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, that they might die there; but the people of God observing their time, besought him for them, and after seven days or more they were set at liberty.</p>

<h2>61. Ill-treatment of the poor</h2>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, as being grieved at this, again devised another yet more cruel and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> deed; cruel in the eyes of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but well suited to their antichristian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The Lord commanded that we should remember the poor; He said, 'Sell that you have, and give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms'</a> and again 'I was a hungred, and you gave Me meat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me drink; for inasmuch as you have done it unto one of these little ones, you have done it unto Me. ' But these men, as being in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have presumed to act contrary to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in this respect also. For when the Duke gave up the Churches to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and the destitute <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> were unable to continue any longer in them, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> sat down in places which the Clergy entrusted with the care of them appointed. And when the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> saw that the brethren readily ministered unto them and supported them, they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> also, beating them on the feet, and accused those who gave to them before the Duke. This was done by means of a certain soldier named Dynamius. And it was well-pleasing to Sebastian , for there is no mercy in the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>; nay, it is considered a hateful thing among them to show mercy to a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man.  Here then was a novel subject of complaint; and a new kind of court now first invented by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. Persons were brought to trial for acts of kindness which they had performed; he who showed mercy was accused, and he who had received a benefit was beaten; and they wished rather that a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man should suffer hunger, than that he who was willing to show mercy should give to him. Such sentiments these modern <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for such they are, have learned from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of old, who when they saw him who had been blind from his birth recover his sight, and him who had been a long time sick of the palsy made whole, accused  the Lord who had bestowed these benefits upon them, and judged them to be transgressors who had experienced His goodness. </p>

<h2>62. Ill-treatment of the poor</h2>

<p>Who was not struck with astonishment at these proceedings? Who did not execrate both the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and its defenders? Who failed to perceive that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are indeed more cruel than wild beasts? For they had no prospect of gain  from their iniquity, for the sake of which they might have acted in this manner; but they rather increased the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> against themselves. They thought by treachery and terror to force certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> into their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, so that they might be brought to communicate with them; but the event turned out quite the contrary. The sufferers endured as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> whatever they inflicted upon them, and neither betrayed nor denied the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And those who were without and witnessed their conduct, and at last even the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, when they saw these things, execrated them as antichristian, as cruel executioners; for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is prone to pity and sympathise with the poor. But these men have lost even the common sentiments of humanity; and that kindness which they would have desired to meet with at the hands of others, had themselves been sufferers, they would not permit others to receive, but employed against them the severity and authority of the magistrates, and especially of the Duke.</p>

<h2>63. Ill-treatment of the Presbyters and Deacons</h2>

<p>What they have done to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> and Deacons; how they drove them into banishment under sentence passed upon them by the Duke and the magistrates, causing the soldiers to bring out their kinsfolk from the houses , and Gorgonius, the commander of the police  to beat them with stripes; and how (most cruel act of all) with much insolence they plundered the loaves  of these and of those who were now dead; these things it is impossible for words to describe, for their cruelty surpasses all the powers of language. What terms could one employ which might seem equal to the subject? What circumstances could one mention first, so that those next recorded would not be found more dreadful, and the next more dreadful still? All their attempts and iniquities  were full of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and impiety; and so unscrupulous and artful are they, that they endeavour to deceive by promises of protection, and by bribing with money , that so, since they cannot recommend themselves by fair means, they may thereby make some display to impose on the simple.</p>
