<h1>History of the Arians, Part VIII</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. ATHANASIUS</em></strong>

<h2>64. Persecution in Egypt</h2>

<p>64. Who would call them even by the name of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; much less by that of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Would any one regard their habits and feelings as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and not rather those of wild beasts, seeing their cruel and savage conduct? They are more worthless than public hangmen; more audacious than all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. To the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> they are much inferior, and stand far apart and separate from them.  I have heard from our fathers, and I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> their report to be a faithful one, that long ago, when a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> arose in the time  of Maximian, the grandfather of Constantius, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> concealed our brethren the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who were sought after, and frequently suffered the loss of their own substance, and had trial of imprisonment, solely that they might not betray the fugitives. They protected those who fled to them for refuge, as they would have done their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and were determined to run all risks on their behalf. But now these admirable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the inventors of a new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, act altogether the contrary part; and are distinguished for nothing but their treachery. They have appointed themselves as executioners, and seek to betray all alike, and make those who conceal others the objects of their plots, esteeming equally as their enemy both him that conceals and him that is concealed. So murderous are they; so emulous in their evil-doings of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of Judas.</p>

<h2>65. Martyrdom of Secundus of Barka</h2>

<p>The crimes these men have committed cannot adequately be described. I would only say, that as I write and wish to enumerate all their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of iniquity, the thought enters my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, whether this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> be not the fourth daughter of the horse-leach <span class="stiki" id="note281724"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse15">Proverbs&nbsp;30:15</a></span> in the Proverbs, since after so many acts of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, so many murders, it has not yet said, 'It is enough.' No; it still rages, and goes about  seeking after those whom it has not yet discovered, while those whom it has already injured, it is eager to injure anew. After the night attack, after the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> committed in consequence of it, after the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> brought about by Heraclius, they cease not yet to accuse us <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> before the Emperor (and they are confident that as impious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> they will obtain a hearing), desiring that something more than banishment may be inflicted upon us, and that hereafter those who do not consent to their impieties may be destroyed. Accordingly, being now emboldened in an extreme degree, that most abandoned Secundus  of Pentapolis, and Stephanus  his accomplice, conscious that their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was a defence of any <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> they might commit, on discovering a Presbyter at Barka who would not comply with their desires (he was called Secundus, being of the same name, but not of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>), they kicked him till he died.  While he was thus suffering he imitated the Saint, and said, 'Let no one avenge my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> before <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judges; I have the Lord for my avenger, for whose sake I suffer these things at their hands.' They however were not moved with pity at these words, nor did they feel any awe of the sacred season; for it was during the time of Lent  that they thus kicked the man to death.</p>

<h2>66. Persecution the weapon of Arianism</h2>

<p>O new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, that hast put on the whole <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in impiety and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>! For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is but a lately invented <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and although certain heretofore appear to have adopted its doctrines, yet they concealed them, and were not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to hold them. But Eusebius and <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, like serpents coming out of their holes, have vomited forth the poison of this impiety; <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> daring to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> openly, and  Eusebius defending his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. He was not however able to support the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, until, as I said before, he found a patron  for it in the Emperor. Our fathers called an Ecumenical Council, when three hundred of them, more or less , met together and condemned the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and all declared that it was alien and strange to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Upon this its supporters, perceiving that they were dishonoured, and had now no good ground of argument to insist upon, devised a different method, and attempted to vindicate it by means of external power. And herein one may especially admire the novelty as well as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of their device, and how they go beyond all other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. For these support their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> by persuasive arguments calculated to deceive the simple; the Greeks, as the Apostle has said, make their attack with excellency and persuasiveness of speech, and with plausible fallacies; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, leaving the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, now, as the Apostle again has said, contend about 'fables and endless genealogies <span class="stiki" id="note281733"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:4</a></span>;' and the Manichees and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> with them, and others, corrupting the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, put forth fables in terms of their own inventions. But the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> are bolder than them all, and have shown that the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are but their younger sisters , whom, as I have said, they surpass in impiety, emulating them all, and especially the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their iniquity. For as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when they were unable to prove the charges which they pretended to allege against <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, straightway led him to the chief captain and the governor; so likewise these men, who surpass the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their devices, make use only of the power of the judges; and if any one so much as speaks against them, he is dragged before the Governor or the General.</p>

<h2>67. Arianismworse than other heresies, because of Persecution</h2>

<p>The other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> also, when the very Truth has refuted them on the clearest evidence, are wont to be silent, being simply confounded by their conviction. But this modern and accursed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, when it is overthrown by argument, when it is cast down and covered with shame by the very Truth, immediately endeavours to coerce by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and stripes and imprisonment those whom it has been unable to persuade by argument, thereby acknowledging itself to be anything rather than godly. For it is the part of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> godliness not to compel , but to persuade, as I said before. Thus our Lord Himself, not as employing force, but as offering to their free choice, has said to all, 'If any man will follow after Me <span class="stiki" id="note281736"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;16:24</a></span>;' and to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, 'Will you also go away <span class="stiki" id="note281737"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse67">John&nbsp;6:67</a></span>?' This <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, however, is altogether alien from godliness; and therefore how otherwise should it act, than contrary to our Saviour, seeing also that it has enlisted that enemy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Constantius, as it were <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> himself , to be its leader in impiety? He for its sake has earnestly endeavoured to emulate Saul in savage cruelty. For when the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> gave victuals to David, Saul commanded, and they were all destroyed, in number three hundred and five ; and this man, now that all avoid the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and confess a sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, annuls a Council of full three hundred Bishops, banishes the Bishops themselves, and hinders the people from the practice of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and from their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, preventing their public assemblies. And as Saul overthrew Nob, the city of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, so this man, advancing even further in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, has given up the Churches to the impious. And as he honoured Doeg the accuser before the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> David, giving ear to the Ziphites; so this man prefers <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the godly, and still persecutes them that flee from him, giving ear to his own eunuchs, who <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accuse the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. He does not perceive that whatever he does or writes in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, involves an attack  upon the Saviour.</p>

<h2>68. Constantius worse than Saul, Ahab, and Pilate. His past conduct to his own relations</h2>

<p>Ahab himself did not act so cruelly towards the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as this man has acted towards the Bishops. For he was at least pricked in his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, when Naboth had been murdered, and was afraid at the sight <span class="stiki" id="note281741"><a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;21:20</a></span> of Elijah, but this man neither reverenced the great Hosius, nor was wearied or pricked in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, after banishing so many Bishops; but like another <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, the more he is afflicted, the more he is hardened, and imagines greater <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> day by day. And the most extraordinary instance of his iniquity was the following. It happened that when the Bishops were condemned to banishment, certain other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> also received their sentence on charges of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> or sedition or theft, each according to the quality of his offense. These men after a few months he released, on being requested to do so, as <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> did Barabbas; but the servants of Christ he not only refused to set at liberty, but even sentenced them to more unmerciful punishment in the place of their exile, proving himself 'an undying <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ' to them. To the others through congeniality of disposition he became a friend; but to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> he was an enemy on account of their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Is it not clear to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from hence, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of old when they demanded Barabbas, and crucified the Lord, acted but the part which these present enemies of Christ are acting together with Constantius? Nay, that he is even more bitter than <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, when he perceived <span class="stiki" id="note281743"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;27:24</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of the deed, washed his hands; but this man, while he banishes the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, gnashes his teeth against them more and more.</p>

<p>69. But what wonder is it if, after he has been led into impious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, he is so cruel towards the Bishops, since the common feelings of humanity could not induce him to spare even his own kindred. His uncles  he slew; his cousins he put out of the way; he commiserated not the sufferings of his father-in-law, though he had married his daughter, or of his kinsmen; but he has ever been a transgressor of his oaths towards all. So likewise he treated his brother in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> manner; and now he pretends to build his sepulchre, although he delivered up to the barbarians his <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> wife Olympias, whom his brother had protected till his death, and had brought up as his intended consort. Moreover he attempted to set aside his wishes, although he boasts to be his heir ; for so he writes, in terms which any one possessed of but a small measure of sense would be ashamed of. But when I compare his letters, I find that he does not possess common understanding, but that his mind is solely regulated by the suggestions of others, and that he has no mind of his own at all. Now Solomon says, 'If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <span class="stiki" id="note281746"><a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;29:12</a></span>.' This man proves by his actions that he is such an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> one, and that those about him are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</p>

<h2>70. Inconstancy of Constantius</h2>

<p>How then, being such an one, and taking pleasure in such associates, can he ever design anything just or reasonable, entangled as he is in the iniquity of his followers, men who verily bewitch him, or rather who have trampled his brains under their heels? Wherefore he now writes letters , and then repents that he has written them, and after repenting is again stirred up to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and then again laments his <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, and being undetermined what to do, he shows a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> destitute of understanding. Being then of such a character, one must fairly pity him, because that under the semblance and name of freedom he is the slave of those who drag him on to gratify their own impious pleasure. In a word, while through his folly and inconstancy, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says , he is willing to comply with the desires of others, he has given himself up to condemnation, to be consumed by fire in the future judgment; at once consenting to do whatever they wish, and gratifying them in their designs against the Bishops, and in their exertion of authority over the Churches. For behold, he has now again thrown into disorder all the Churches of Alexandria  and of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Libya, and has publicly given orders, that the Bishops of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be cast out of their churches, and that they be all given up to the professors of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> doctrines.  The General began to carry this order into execution; and straightway Bishops were sent off in chains, and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> and Monks bound with iron, after being almost beaten to death with stripes. Disorder prevails in every place; all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Libya are in danger, the people being indignant at this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> command, and seeing in it the preparation for the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, and beholding their property plundered by others, and given up into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>71. This wickednessunprecedented</h2>

<p>When was ever such iniquity heard of? When was such an <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a> ever perpetrated, even in times of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>? They were <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> formerly; but they did not bring their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> into the Churches. Zenobia , was a Jewess, and a supporter of <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>; but she did not give up the Churches to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for Synagogues. This is a new piece of iniquity. It is not simply <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but more than <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, it is a prelude and preparation  for the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. Even if it be admitted that they invented false charges against Athanasius and the rest of the Bishops whom they banished, yet what is this to their later practices? What charges have they to allege against the whole of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Libya and Pentapolis ? For they have begun no longer to lay their plots against individuals, in which case they might be able to frame a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> against them; but they have set upon all in a body, so that if they merely choose to invent accusations against them, they must be condemned. Thus their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> has blinded their understanding <span class="stiki" id="note281754"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse21">Wisdom&nbsp;2:21</a></span>; and they have required, without any reason assigned, that the whole body of the Bishops shall be expelled, and thereby they show that the charges they framed against Athanasius and the rest of the Bishops whom they banished were false, and invented for no other purpose than to support the accursed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This is now no longer concealed, but has become most manifest to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. He commanded Athanasius to be expelled out of the city, and gave up the Churches to them. And the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> and Deacons that were with him, who had been appointed by Peter and Alexander, were also expelled and driven into banishment; and the real <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, who not through any suspicions arising from circumstances, but on account of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> had been expelled at first together with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> himself by the Bishop Alexander,&mdash; Secundus in Libya, in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> Euzoius  the Chanan&aelig;an, Julius, Ammon, Marcus, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, Zosimus, and Sarapion surnamed Pelycon, and in Libya Sisinnius, and the younger men with him, associates in his impiety; these have obtained possession of the Churches.</p>

<h2>72. Banishment of Egyptian Bishops</h2>

<p>And the General Sebastian wrote to the governors and military authorities in every place; and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Bishops were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and those who professed impious doctrines were brought in in their stead. They banished Bishops who had grown old in orders, and had been many years in the Episcopate, having been ordained by the Bishop Alexander; Ammonius , Hermes, Anagamphus, and Marcus, they sent to the Upper Oasis; Muis, Psenosiris, Nilammon, Plenes, Marcus, and Athenodorus to Ammoniaca, with no other intention than that they should perish in their passage through the deserts. They had no pity on them though they were suffering from illness, and indeed proceeded on their journey with so much difficulty on account of their weakness, that they were <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to be carried in litters, and their sickness was so dangerous that the materials for their burial accompanied them. One of them indeed died, but they would not even permit the body to be given up to his friends for interment. With the same purpose they banished also the Bishop Dracontius to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> places about Clysma, Philo to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, Adelphius to Psinabla in the Thebais, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> Hierax and Dioscorus to Syene. They likewise drove into exile Ammonius, Agathus, Agathod&aelig;mon, Apollonius, Eulogius, Apollos, Paphnutius, Gaius, and Flavius, ancient Bishops, as also the Bishops Dioscorus, Ammonius, Heraclides, and Psais; some of whom they gave up to work in the stone-quarries, others they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> with an intention to destroy, and many others they plundered. They banished also forty of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, with certain <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> whom they had before exposed to the fire ; beating them so severely with rods taken from palm-trees, that after lingering five days some of them died, and others had recourse to surgical treatment on account of the thorns left in their limbs, from which they suffered torments worse than death.  But what is most dreadful to the mind of any man of sound understanding, though characteristic of these miscreants, is this: When the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> during the scourging called upon the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they gnashed their teeth against them with increased fury. Nay more, they would not give up the bodies of the dead to their friends for burial, but concealed them that they might appear to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. They did not however escape detection; the whole city perceived it, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> withdrew from them as executioners, as malefactors and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>. Moreover they overthrew <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, and endeavoured to cast <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> into the fire; they plundered houses, and breaking into the house of certain free citizens where the Bishop had deposited a treasure, they plundered and took it away. They scourged the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> on the soles of their feet, and hindered them from receiving their <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.</p>

<h2>73. Character of Ariannominees</h2>

<p>Such were the iniquities practised by the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; and as to their further <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of impiety, who could hear the account of them without shuddering? They had caused these venerable old men and aged Bishops to be sent into banishment; they now appointed in their stead profligate <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> youths, whom they thought to raise at once to the highest dignity, though they were not even Catechumens.  And others who were accused of bigamy , and even of worse crimes, they nominated Bishops on account of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and civil power which they possessed, and sent them out as it were from a market, upon their giving them gold. And now more dreadful calamities befell the people. For when they rejected these mercenary dependents of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, so alien from themselves, they were scourged, they were proscribed, they were shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by the General (who did all this readily, being a Manichee), in order that they might no longer seek after their own Bishops, but be forced to accept those whom they abominated, men who were now guilty of the same mockeries as they had before practised among their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</p>

<h2>74. The Episcopal appointments of Constantius a mark of Antichrist</h2>

<p>Will not every just person break forth into lamentations at the sight or hearing of these things, at perceiving the arrogance and extreme <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> of these impious men? 'The righteous lament in the place of the impious. ' After all these things, and now that the impiety has reached such a pitch of audacity, who will any longer venture to call this Costyllius  a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and not rather the image of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>? For what mark of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> is yet wanting? How can he in any way fail to be regarded as that one? Or how can the latter fail to be supposed such a one as he is? Did not the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> offer those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in the great Church in the C&aelig;sareum , and utter their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> against Christ as by His command? And does not the vision of Daniel thus describe <span class="stiki" id="note281764"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse25">Daniel&nbsp;7:25</a></span> <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>; that he shall make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and prevail against them, and exceed all that have been before him in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> and shall <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> three kings, and speak words against the Most High, and shall think to change times and <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>? Now what other person besides Constantius has ever attempted to do these things? He is surely such a one as <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> would be. He speaks words against the Most High by supporting this impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: he makes <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> by banishing the Bishops; although indeed he exercises this power but for a little while  to his own destruction. Moreover he has surpassed those before him in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, having devised a new mode of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; and after he had overthrown three kings, namely Vetranio, Magnentius, and Gallus, he straightway undertook the patronage of impiety; and like a giant  he has dared in his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to set himself up against the Most High. He has thought to change <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, by transgressing the ordinance of the Lord given us through His Apostles, by altering the customs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and inventing a new kind of appointments. For he sends from strange places, distant a fifty days' journey , Bishops attended by soldiers to people unwilling to receive them; and instead of an introduction to the acquaintance of their people, they bring with them threatening messages and letters to the magistrates. Thus he sent Gregory from Cappadocia  to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>; he transferred Germinius from <a href="../cathen/04598a.htm">Cyzicus</a> to Sirmium; he removed Cecropius from <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a> to <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>.</p>

<h2>75. Arrival of George at Alexandria, and proceedings of Constantius in Italy</h2>

<p>Again he transferred from Cappadocia to Milan one Auxentius , an intruder rather than a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, whom he commanded to stay there, after he had banished for his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards Christ Dionysius the Bishop of the place, a godly man. But this person was as yet even <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Latin language, and unskilful in everything except impiety. And now one George, a Cappadocian, who was contractor of stores  at Constantinople, and having embezzled all monies that he received, was <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to fly, he commanded to enter Alexandria with military pomp, and supported by the authority of the General. Next, finding one Epictetus  a novice, a bold young man, he loved him , perceiving that he was ready for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; and by his means he carries on his designs against those of the Bishops whom he desires to ruin. For he is prepared to do everything that the Emperor wishes; who accordingly availing himself of his assistance, has committed at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a strange act, but one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> resembling the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. Having made preparations in the Palace instead of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and caused some three of his own eunuchs to attend instead of the people, he then compelled three  ill-conditioned spies  (for one cannot call them Bishops), to ordain forsooth as Bishop one Felix , a man worthy of them, then in the Palace. For the people perceiving the iniquitous proceedings of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> would not allow them to enter the Churches , and withdrew themselves far from them.</p>

<h2>76. Tyrannous banishment of Bishops by Constantius</h2>

<p>Now what is yet wanting to make him <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>? Or what more could <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> do at his coming than this man has done? Will he not find when he comes that the way has been already prepared for him by this man easily to deceive the people? Again , he claims to himself the right of deciding causes, which he refers to the Court instead of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and presides at them in person. And strange it is to say, when he perceives the accusers at a loss, he takes up the accusation himself, so that the injured party may no longer be able to defend himself on account of the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> which he displays. This he did in the proceedings against Athanasius. For when he saw the boldness of the Bishops Paulinus, Lucifer, Eusebius, and Dionysius, and how out of the recantation of Ursacius and Valens  they confuted those who spoke against the Bishop, and advised that Valens and his fellows should no longer be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, since they had already retracted what they now asserted, he immediately stood up  and said, 'I am now the accuser of Athanasius; on my account you must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what these assert.' And then, when they said&mdash;'But how can you be an accuser, when the accused person is not present? For if you are his accuser, yet he is not present, and therefore cannot be tried. And the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not one that concerns Rome, so that you should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> as being the Emperor; but it is a matter that concerns a Bishop; for the trial ought to be conducted on equal terms both to the accuser and the accused. And besides, how can you accuse him? For you could not be present to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the conduct of one who lived at so great a distance from you; and if you speak but what you have heard from these, you ought also to give credit to what he says; but if you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him, while you do <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, it is plain that they assert these things for your sake, and accuse Athanasius only to gratify you?'&mdash; when he heard this, thinking that what they had so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> spoken was an insult to himself, he sent them into banishment; and being exasperated against Athanasius, he wrote in a more savage strain, requiring that he should suffer what has now befallen him, and that the Churches should be given up to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, and that they should be allowed to do whatever they pleased.</p>

<h2>77. Constantius the precursor of Antichrist</h2>

<p>Terrible indeed, and worse than terrible are such proceedings; yet conduct suitable to him who assumes the character of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. Who that beheld him taking the lead of his pretended Bishops, and presiding in Ecclesiastical causes, would not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> exclaim that this was 'the <a href="../cathen/01046a.htm">abomination of desolation</a> <span class="stiki" id="note281780"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse27">Daniel&nbsp;9:27</a></span> ' spoken of by Daniel? For having put on the profession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and entering into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, and standing therein, he lays waste the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, transgressing their Canons, and enforcing the observance of his own decrees. Will any one now venture to say that this is a peaceful time with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and not a time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>? A <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> indeed, such as never arose before, and such as no one perhaps will again stir up, except 'the son of lawlessness <span class="stiki" id="note281781"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:8</a></span>,' do these enemies of Christ exhibit, who already present a picture of him in their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Wherefore it especially behooves us to be sober, lest this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which has reached such a height of impudence, and has diffused itself abroad like the 'poison of an adder <span class="stiki" id="note281782"><a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse32">Proverbs&nbsp;23:32</a></span>,' as it is written in the Proverbs, and which teaches doctrines contrary to the Saviour; lest, I say, this be that 'falling away <span class="stiki" id="note281783"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:3</a></span>,' after which He shall be revealed, of whom Constantius is surely the forerunner.  Else why is he so mad against the godly? Why does he contend for it as his own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and call every one his enemy who will not comply with the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and admit gladly the allegations of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and dishonour so many venerable Councils? Why did he command that the Churches should be given up to the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>? Was it not that, when that other comes, he may thus find a way to enter into them, and may take to himself him who has prepared those places for him? For the ancient Bishops who were ordained by Alexander, and by his predecessor Achillas, and by Peter before him, have been cast out; and those introduced whom the companions of soldiers nominated; and they nominated only such as promised to adopt their doctrines.</p>

<h2>78. Alliance of Meletians with Arians</h2>

<p>This was an easy proposition for the <a href="../cathen/10164a.htm">Meletians</a> to comply with; for the greater part, or rather the whole of them, have never had a religious education, nor are they acquainted with the 'sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ' in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor do they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at all what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> is, or what writings we <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> possess. For having come out, some of them from the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and others from the senate, or from the first civil offices, for the sake of the miserable exemption  from duty and for the patronage they gained, and having <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a>  the <a href="../cathen/10164a.htm">Meletians</a> who preceded them, they have been advanced to this dignity even before they had been under instruction. And even if they pretended to have been such, yet what kind of instruction is to be obtained among the <a href="../cathen/10164a.htm">Meletians</a>? But indeed without even pretending to be under instruction, they came at once, and immediately were called Bishops, just as children receive a name. Being then <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of this description, they thought the thing of no great consequence, nor even supposed that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was different from impiety. Accordingly from being <a href="../cathen/10164a.htm">Meletians</a> they readily and speedily became <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>; and if the Emperor should command them to adopt any other profession, they are ready to change again to that also. Their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> godliness quickly brings them to submit to the prevailing folly, and that which happens to be first taught them. For it is nothing to them to be carried about by every wind  and tempest, so long as they are only exempt from duty, and obtain the patronage of men; nor would they scruple probably to change again  to what they were before, even to become such as they were when they were <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. Any how, being men of such an easy temper, and considering the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as a civil senate, and like <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> being idolatrously minded, they put on the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> name  of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, under which they polluted the whole of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, by causing so much as the name of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> therein. For <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> has heretofore been the only country, throughout which the profession of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was boldly maintained ; and therefore these misbelievers have striven to introduce jealousy there also, or rather not they, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who has stirred them up, in order that when his herald <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> shall come, he may find that the Churches in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> also are his own, and that the <a href="../cathen/10164a.htm">Meletians</a> have already been instructed in his principles, and may recognise himself as already formed  in them.</p>

<h2>79. Behaviour of the Meletians contrasted with that of the Alexandrian Christians</h2>

<p>Such is the effect of that iniquitous order which was issued by Constantius. On the part of the people there was displayed a ready alacrity to submit to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and an increased <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of this most impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and yet lamentations for their Churches, and groans burst from all, while they cried unto the Lord, 'Spare Your people, O Lord, and give not Your heritage unto Your enemies to reproach <span class="stiki" id="note281793"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse17">Joel&nbsp;2:17</a></span>;' but make haste to deliver us out of the hand of the lawless.  For behold, 'they have not spared Your servants, but are preparing the way for <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.' For the <a href="../cathen/10164a.htm">Meletians</a> will never resist him, nor will they care for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor will they esteem it an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing to deny Christ. They are men who have not approached the word with sincerity; like the chameleon  they assume every various appearance; they are hirelings of any who will make use of them. They make not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> their aim, but prefer before it their present pleasure; they say only, 'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die <span class="stiki" id="note281796"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:32</a></span>.' Such a profession and faithless temper is more worthy of Epicritian  players than of <a href="../cathen/10164a.htm">Meletians</a>. But the faithful servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Bishops who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with sincerity, and live not for themselves, but for the Lord; these faithfully believing in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, as I said before, that the charges which were alleged against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were false, and plainly fabricated for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (for by the recantation  of Ursacius and Valens they detected the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> which were devised against Athanasius, for the purpose of removing him out of the way, and of introducing into the Churches the impieties of the enemies of Christ); these, I say, perceiving all this, as defenders and preachers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, chose rather, and endured to be insulted and driven into banishment, than to subscribe against him, and to hold communion with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> madmen. They forgot not the lessons they had taught to others; yea, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well that great dishonour remains for the traitors, but for them which confess the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; and that to the careless and such as <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Constantius will happen no good thing; but for them that endure tribulations here, as sailors reach a quiet haven after a storm, as wrestlers receive a crown after the combat, so these shall obtain great and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and delight in heaven;&mdash; such as Joseph obtained after those tribulations; such as the great Daniel had after his <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> and the manifold conspiracies of the courtiers against him; such as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> now enjoys, being crowned by the Saviour; such as the people of God everywhere expect. They, seeing these things, were not infirm of purpose, but waxed strong in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> , and increased in their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> more and more. Being fully persuaded of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and impieties of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, they condemn the persecutor, and in heart and mind run together the same course with them that are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, that they also may obtain the crown of Confession.</p>

<h2>80. Duty of separating from heretics</h2>

<p>One might say much more against this detestable and antichristian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and might demonstrate by many arguments that the practices of Constantius are a prelude to the coming of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. But seeing that, as the Prophet <span class="stiki" id="note281800"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;1:6</a></span> has said, from the feet even to the head there is no reasonableness in it, but it is full of all filthiness and all impiety, so that the very name of it ought to be avoided as a dog's vomit or the poison of serpents; and seeing that Costyllius openly exhibits the image of the adversary <span class="stiki" id="note281801"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:4</a></span>; in order that our words may not be too many, it will be well to content ourselves with the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, and that we all <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the precept which it has given us both in regard to other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and especially respecting this. That precept is as follows; 'Depart, depart, go out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go out of the midst of them, and be separate, that bear the vessels of the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note281802"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;52:11</a></span>.' This may suffice  to instruct us all, so that if any one has been deceived by them, he may go out from them, as out of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and not return again unto them, lest he suffer the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife; and if any one has continued from the beginning pure from this impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, he may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in Christ and say, 'We have not stretched out our hands to a strange god ; neither have we worshipped the works of our own hands, nor served the creature  more than You, the God that hast created all things through Your word, the Only-Begotten Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through whom to You the Father together with the same Word in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and power for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.'</p>

<h2>81. The Second Protest</h2> 

<p>The people of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, which is under the government of the most Reverend Bishop Athanasius, make this public protest by those whose names are under-written.</p>

<p>We have already protested against the nocturnal assault which was committed upon ourselves and the Lord's house; although in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> there needed no protest in respect to proceedings with which the whole city has been already made acquainted. For the bodies of the slain which were discovered were exposed in public, and the bows and arrows and other arms found in the Lord's house loudly proclaim the iniquity.</p>

<p>But whereas after our Protest already made, the most illustrious Duke Syrianus endeavours to force all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to agree with him, as though no tumult had been made, nor any had perished (wherein is no small <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that these things were not done according to the wishes of the most gracious Emperor Augustus Constantius; for he would not have been so much afraid of the consequences of this transaction, had he acted therein by command); and whereas also, when we went to him, and requested him not to do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to any, nor to deny what had taken place, he ordered us, being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to be beaten with clubs; thereby again giving <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the nocturnal assault which has been directed against the Church:&mdash; </p>

<p>We therefore make also this present Protest, certain of us being now about to travel to the most religious Emperor Augustus: and we <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> Maximus the Prefect of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and the Controllers , in the name of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the most religious Augustus Constantius, to relate all these things to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of Augustus, and to the authority of the most illustrious Prefects.  We <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> also the masters of vessels, to publish these things everywhere, and to carry them to the ears of the most religious Augustus, and to the Prefects and the Magistrates in every place, in order that it may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> has been waged against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that, in the times of Augustus Constantius, Syrianus has caused <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and many others to become <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</p>

<p>As it dawned upon the fifth before the Ides of February , that is to say, the fourteenth of the month Mechir, while we were keeping vigil  in the Lord's house, and engaged in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (for there was to be a communion on the Preparation ); suddenly about midnight, the most illustrious Duke Syrianus attacked us and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with many legions of soldiers  armed with naked swords and javelins and other warlike instruments, and wearing helmets on their heads; and actually while we were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and while the lessons were being read, they broke down the doors. And when the doors were burst open by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the multitude, he gave command, and some of them were shooting; others shouting, their arms rattling, and their swords flashing in the light of the lamps; and immediately <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> were being slain, many men trampled down, and falling over one another as the soldiers came upon them, and several were pierced with arrows and perished. Some of the soldiers also were betaking themselves to plunder, and were stripping the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who were more afraid of being even touched by them than they were of death. The Bishop continued sitting upon his throne, and exhorted all to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. The Duke led on the attack, having with him Hilarius the notary, whose part in the proceedings was shown in the sequel. The Bishop was seized, and barely escaped being torn to pieces; and having fallen into a state of insensibility, and appearing as one dead, he disappeared from among them, and has gone we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whither. They were eager to kill him. And when they saw that many had perished, they gave orders to the soldiers to remove out of sight the bodies of the dead. But the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who were left behind were buried in the tombs, having attained the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> in the times of the most religious Constantius. Deacons also were beaten with stripes even in the Lord's house, and were shut up there.</p>

<p>Nor did matters stop even here: for after all this had happened, whosoever pleased broke open any door that he could, and searched, and plundered what was within. They entered even into those places which not even all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are allowed to enter. Gorgonius, the commander of the city force , <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this, for he was present. And no unimportant evidence of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this hostile assault is afforded by the circumstance, that the armour and javelins and swords borne by those who entered were left in the Lord's house. They have been hung up in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> until this time, that they might not be able to deny it: and although they sent several times Dynamius the soldier , as well as the Commander  of the city police, desiring to take them away, we would not allow it, until the circumstance was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all.</p>

<p>Now if an order has been given that we should be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> we are all ready to suffer <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. But if it be not by order of Augustus, we desire Maximus the Prefect of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and all the city magistrates to request of him that they may not again be suffered thus to assail us. And we desire also that this our petition may be presented to him, that they may not attempt to bring in hither any other Bishop: for we have resisted unto death , desiring to have the most Reverend Athanasius, whom God gave us at the beginning, according to the succession of our fathers; whom also the most religious Augustus Constantius himself sent to us with letters and oaths. And we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that when his Piety is informed of what has taken place, he will be greatly displeased, and will do nothing contrary to his oaths, but will again give orders that our Bishop Athanasius shall remain with us.</p>

<p>To the Consuls to be elected  after the Consulship of the most illustrious Arb&aelig;thion and Collianus , on the seventeenth Mechir , which is the day before the Ides of February.</p>
