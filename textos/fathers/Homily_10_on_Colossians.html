<h1>Homily 10 on Colossians</h1>

<p class="c12"><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse18">Colossians 3:18-25</a></span> </p>

<p><q> <em>Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives, and be not bitter against them. Children, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in all things, for this is well-pleasing in</em>  <em>the Lord. Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged. Servants, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord: whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that from the Lord you shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ. For he that does wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he has done: and there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </em> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse1">Colossians 4:1</a></span> <em> Masters, render unto your servants that which is just and equal; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you also have a Master in heaven.</em></q></p>

<p>Why does he not give these commands everywhere, and in all the Epistles, but only here, and in that to the Ephesians, and that to Timothy, and that to Titus? Because probably there were dissensions in these cities; or probably they were correct in other respects, so that it was expedient they should hear about these things. Rather, however, what he says to these, he says to all. Now in these things also this Epistle bears great resemblance to that to the Ephesians, either  because it was not fitting to write about these things to men now  at peace, who needed to be instructed in high doctrines as yet lacking to them, or because that for <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had been comforted under trials, it were superfluous to hear on these subjects. So that I conjecture, that in this place the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was now well-grounded, and that these things are said as in finishing.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse18">Ver. 18</a>. <q>Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</q></p>

<p>That is, be subject for God's sake, because this adorns you, he says, not them. For I mean not that subjection which is due to a master, nor yet that alone which is of nature, but that for God's sake.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse19">Ver. 19</a>. <q>Husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives, and be not bitter against them.</q></p>

<p>See how again he has exhorted to reciprocity. As in the other case he enjoins <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so also does he here. For it is possible for one who loves even, to be bitter. What he says then is this. Fight not; for nothing is more bitter than this fighting, when it takes place on the part of the husband toward the wife. For the fightings which happen between beloved <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, these are bitter; and he shows that it arises from great bitterness, when, says he, any one is at variance with his own member. To <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> therefore is the husband's part, to yield pertains to the other side. If then each one contributes his own part, all stands firm. From being loved, the wife too becomes loving; and from her being submissive, the husband becomes yielding. And see how in nature also it has been so ordered, that the one should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the other <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. For when the party governing loves the governed, then everything stands fast. Love from the governed is not so requisite, as from the governing towards the governed; for from the other <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is due. For that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has beauty, and the man desire, shows nothing else than that for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it has been made so. Do not therefore, because your wife is subject to you, act the despot; nor because your husband loves you, be thou puffed up. Let neither the husband's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> elate the wife, nor the wife's subjection puff up the husband. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> has He subjected her to you, that she may be loved the more. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> He has made you to be loved, O wife, that you may easily bear your subjection. Fear not in being a subject; for subjection to one that loves you has no hardship. Fear not in loving, for you have her yielding. In no other way then could a bond have been. You have then your authority of necessity, proceeding from nature; maintain also the bond that proceeds from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for this allows the weaker to be endurable. </p>

<p><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse20">Ver. 20</a>. <q>Children, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.</q></p>

<p>Again he has put that, <q>in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,</q> at once laying down the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and shaming them, and casting them down. For this, says he, is well-pleasing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. See how he would have us do all not from nature only, but, prior to this, from what is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may also have reward.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse21">Ver. 21</a>. <q>Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.</q></p>

<p>Lo! Again here also is subjection and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And he said not, <q>Love your children,</q> for it had been superfluous, seeing that nature itself constrains to this; but what needed correction he corrected; that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> should in this case also be the more vehement, because that the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is greater. For it nowhere lays down as an exemplification the relation of husband and wife; but what? Hear the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> saying, <q>Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pitied them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa102.htm#verse13">Psalm 103:13</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> And again Christ says, <q>What man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse9">Matthew 7:9</a></span></p>

<p><q>Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.</q></p>

<p>He has set down what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> had the greatest power to seize upon them; and while commanding them he has spoken more like a friend; and nowhere does he mention <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for he would overcome <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and bow their tender affections. That is, <q>Make them not more contentious, there are occasions when you ought even to give way.</q></p>

<p>Next he comes to the third kind of authority.</p>

<p>There is here also a certain <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but that no more proceeding from nature, as above, but from habit, and from the authority itself, and the works done. Seeing then that in this case the sphere of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is narrowed, while that of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is amplified, he dwells upon this, wishing to give to these from their <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, what the first have from nature. So that what he discourses with the servants alone  is not for their masters' sakes, but for their own also, that they may make themselves the objects of tender affection to their masters. But he sets not this forth openly; for so he would doubtless have made them supine.</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ver. 22. <q>Servants,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> in all things your masters according to the flesh.</q></p>

<p>And see how always he sets down the names, <q>wives, children, servants,</q> being at once a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> claim upon their <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. But that none might be pained, he added, <q>to your masters according to the flesh.</q> Your better part, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is free, he says; your service is for a season. It therefore do thou subject, that your service be no more of constraint. <q>Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers.</q> Make, he says, your service which is by the law, to be from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if when your master sees you not, you do your duty and what is for his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, it is manifest that you do it because of the sleepless Eye. <q>Not with eye-service,</q> he says, <q>as men-pleasers</q>; thus implying, <q>it is you who will have to sustain the damage.</q> For hear the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> saying, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has scattered the bones of the men-pleasers.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa052.htm#verse6">Psalm 53:6</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> See then how he spares them, and brings them to order. <q>But in singleness of heart,</q> he says, <q>fearing God.</q>  For that is not singleness, but hypocrisy, to hold one thing, and act another; to appear one when the master is present, another when he is absent. Therefore he said not simply, <q>in singleness of heart,</q> but, <q>fearing God.</q> For this is to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when, though none be seeing, we do not anything that is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if we do, we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but men. Do you see how he brings them to order?</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse23">Ver. 23</a>. <q>Whatsoever you do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men.</q></p>

<p>He desires to have them freed not only from hypocrisy, but also from slothfulness. He has made them instead of slaves free, when they need not the superintendence of their master; for the expression <q>heartily</q> means this, <q>with good will,</q> not with a slavish necessity, but with freedom, and of choice. And what is the reward?</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse24">Ver. 24</a>. <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a>,</q> he says, <q>that from the Lord you shall receive the recompense of your  inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.</q></p>

<p>For from Him also it is evident that you shall receive the reward. And that you serve the Lord is plain from this.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse25">Ver. 25</a>. <q>For he that does wrong,</q> he says, <q>shall receive again for the wrong that he has done.</q></p>

<p>Here he confirms his former statements. For that his words may not appear to be those of flattery, <q>he shall receive,</q> he says, <q>the wrong he has done,</q> that is, he shall suffer punishment also, <q>for there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</q>  For what if you are a servant? It is no shame to you. And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> he might have said this to the masters, as he did in the Epistle to the Ephesians. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse9">Ephesians 6:9</a></span> But here he seems to me to be alluding to the Grecian masters. For, what if he is a Greek and thou a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? Not the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> but the actions are examined, so that even in this case you ought to serve with good will, and heartily.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse1">Chap. iv. 1</a>. <q>Masters, render unto your servants that which is just and equal.</q></p>

<p>What is <q>just</q>? What is <q>equal</q>? To place them in plenty of everything, and not allow them to stand in need of others, but to recompense them for their labors. For, because I have said that they have their reward from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not thou therefore deprive them of it. And in another place he says, <q>forbearing threatening</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse9">Ephesians 6:9</a></span>, wishing to make them more gentle; for those were perfect men; that is, <q>with what measure you mete, it shall be measured unto you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse2">Matthew 7:2</a></span> And the words, <q>there is no respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>,</q> are spoken with a view to these,  but they are assigned to the others, in order that these may receive them. For when we have said to one person what is applicable to another, we have not corrected him so much, as the one who is in fault. <q>You also,</q> along with them, he says. He has here made the service common, for he says, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you also have a Master in heaven.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse2">Ver. 2</a>. <q>Continue in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, watching therein with thanksgiving.</q></p>

<p>For, since continuing in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> frequently makes <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> listless, therefore he says, <q>watching,</q> that is, sober, not wandering. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, how great a good <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is; therefore he presses heavily. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how careless  many are when they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, wherefore he says, <q>continue</q>  in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as of somewhat laborious, <q>watching therein with thanksgiving.</q> For let this, he says, be your work, to give thanks in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> both for the seen and the unseen, and for His benefits to the willing and unwilling, and for the kingdom, and for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and for tribulation, and for refreshment. For thus is the custom of the Saints to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and to give thanks for the common benefits of all.</p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> a certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> thus. He used to say nothing before these words, but thus, <q>We give You thanks for all Your benefits bestowed upon us the unworthy, from the first day until the present, for what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, for the seen, for the unseen, for those in deed, those in word, those with our wills, those against our wills, for all that have been bestowed upon the unworthy, even us; for tribulations, for refreshments, for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, for punishment, for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. We beseech You to keep our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, having a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; an end worthy of your lovingkindness. You that loved us so as to give Your Only-Begotten for us, grant us to become worthy of Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; give us wisdom in Your word, and in Your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Only-Begotten Christ, inspire the strength that is from You. Thou that gavest The Only-Begotten for us, and hast sent Your <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for the remission of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if in anything we have wilfully or unwillingly transgressed, pardon, and impute it not. Remember all that call upon Your Name in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; remember all that wish us well, or the contrary, for we are all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> Then having added the Prayer  of the Faithful, he there ended; having made that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as a certain crowning part, and a binding together for all. For many benefits does God bestow upon us even against our wills; many also, yea more, without our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> even. For when we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for one thing, and He does to us the reverse, it is plain that He does us good even when we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse3">Ver. 3</a>. <q>Withal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for us also.</q> See his lowlymindedness; he sets himself after them.</p>

<p><q>That God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> He means an entrance, and boldness in speaking. Wonderful! The great athlete said not <q>that I may be freed from my bonds,</q> but being in bonds he exhorted others; and exhorted them for a great object, that himself might get boldness in speaking. Both the two are great, both the quality of the person, and of the thing. Wonderful! How great is the dignity! <q>The <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>,</q> he says, <q>of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> He shows that nothing was more dearly desired by him than this, to speak. <q>For which I am also in bonds; that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse4">Colossians 4:4</a></span> He means with much boldness of speech, and withholding nothing. His bonds display, not obscure him. With much boldness he means. Tell me, are you in bonds, and do you exhort others? Yea, my bonds give me the greater boldness; but I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for God's furtherance, for I have heard the voice of Christ saying, <q>When they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what you shall speak.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse19">Matthew 10:19</a></span> And see, how he has expressed himself in metaphor, <q>that God may open to us a door for the word</q>; (see, how unassuming he is; even in his bonds, how he expresses himself;) that is, that He would soften their hearts. Still he said not so; but, <q>that He would give us boldness</q>; out of lowlymindedness he thus spoke, and that which he had, he asks to receive.</p>

<p>He shows in this Epistle, why Christ came not in those times, in that he calls the former things <q>shadow, but the body,</q> says he, <q>is of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> So that it was necessary they should be formed to habits under the shadow. At the same time also he exhibits the greatest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he bears to them; <q>in order that you,</q> he says, <q>may hear, for that reason, 'I am in bonds.'</q> Again he sets before us those bonds of his; which I so greatly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which rouse up my heart, and always draw me into longing to see <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bound, and in his bonds writing, and preaching, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, and catechizing. In his bonds he was referred to on behalf of the Churches everywhere; in his bonds he built up incalculably. Then was he rather at large. For hear him saying, <q>So that most of the brethren being confident through my bonds are more abundantly bold to speak the word without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse14">Philippians 1:14</a></span> And again he makes the same avowal of himself, saying, <q>For when I am weak, then am I strong.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 12:10</a></span> Wherefore he said also, <q>But the word of God is not bound.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse9">2 Timothy 2:9</a></span> He was bound with malefactors, with prisoners, with murderers; he, the teacher of the world, he that had ascended into the third heaven, that had heard the unspeakable words, was bound. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 12:4</a></span> But then was his course the swifter. He that was bound, was now loosed; he that was unbound, was bound. For he indeed was doing what he would; while the other prevented him not, nor accomplished his own purpose.</p>

<p>What are you about, O senseless one? Do you think he is a fleshly runner? Does he strive in our race-course? His course of life is in heaven; him that runs in heaven, things on earth cannot bind nor hold. Do you see not this sun? Enclose his beams with fetters! stay him from his course! You can not. Then neither can you <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>! Yea, much less this one than that, for this enjoys more of Providence than that, seeing he bears to us light, not such as that is, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>

<p>Where now are they who are unwilling to suffer anything for Christ? But why do I say <q>suffer,</q> seeing that they are unwilling even to give up their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>? In time past <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also used to bind, and cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; but since he has become Christ's servant, he <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a> no more of doing, but of suffering. And this, moreover, is marvelous in the Preaching, when it is thus raised up and increased by the sufferers themselves, and not by the persecutors. Where has any seen such contests as this? He that suffers ill, conquers; he that does ill, is worsted. Brighter is this man than the other. Through bonds the Preaching entered. <q>I am not ashamed</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse16">Romans 1:16</a></span>, yea, I <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> even, he says, in preaching The Crucified. For consider, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: the whole world left those who were at large, and went over to those that are bound; turning away from the imprisoners, it <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> those laden with chains; hating the crucifiers, it worships the Crucified.</p>

<p>Not the only marvel is it that the preachers were fishermen, that they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; but that there were also other hindrances, hindrances too by nature; still the increase was all the more abundant. Not only was their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> no hindrance; but even it itself caused the Preaching to be manifested. For hear Luke saying, <q>And perceiving that they were unlearned and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men, they marveled.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse13">Acts 4:13</a></span> Not only were bonds no hindrance, but even of itself this made them more confident. Not so bold were the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was at large, as when he was bound. For he says, they <q>are more abundantly bold to speak the word</q> of God <q>without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse14">Philippians 1:14</a></span> Where are they that will gainsay the divinity of the Preaching? Was not their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> enough to procure them to be condemned? Would it not then in this case too, affright them? For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that by these two <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> the many are possessed, vainglory and cowardice. Suppose their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> suffered them not to feel ashamed, still the dangers must have put them in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>But, says one, they wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. You do <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> then that they wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. But did they not work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? This is a greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> than to work them, if men were drawn to them without <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Socrates too among the Greeks was put in bonds. What then? Did not his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> straightway flee to Megara? Assuredly, why not? They admitted  his arguments about <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. But see here. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was put in bonds, and his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> waxed the more confident, with reason, for they saw that the Preaching was not hindered. For, can you put the tongue in bonds? Hereby chiefly it runs. For as, except thou have bound the feet of a runner, you have not prevented him from running; so, except thou have bound the tongue of an <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, you have not hindered him from running. And as the former, if you have bound his loins, runs on the rather, and is supported, so too the latter preaches the rather, and with greater boldness.</p>

<p>A prisoner is in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, when there is nothing beyond bonds: but one that despises death, how should he be bound? They did the same as if they had put in bonds the shadow of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and had gagged its mouth. For it was a fighting with shadows; for he was both more tenderly regretted by his friends, and more reverenced by his enemies, as bearing the prize for <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in his bonds. And a crown binds the head; but it disgraces it not, yea rather, it makes it brilliant. Against their wills they crowned him with his chain. For, tell me, was it possible he could <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> iron, who braved the adamantine gates of death? Come we, beloved, to emulate these bonds. As many of you <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as deck yourselves with trinkets of gold, long ye for the bonds of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Not so glitters the collar round your necks, as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of these iron bonds gleamed about his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! If any longs for those, let him <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> these. For what communion has softness with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>; tricking out of the body with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? Those bonds Angels reverence, these they even make a mock of; those bonds are wont to draw up from earth to heaven; these bonds draw down to earth from heaven. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> these are bonds, not those; those are ornament, these are bonds; these, along with the body, afflict the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also; those, along with the body, adorn as well the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Would you be convinced that those are ornament? Tell me which would more have won the notice of the spectators? thou or <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? And why do I say, <q>thou</q>? The queen  herself who is all bedecked with gold would not have attracted the spectators so much; but if it had chanced that both <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in his bonds and the queen had entered the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the same time, all would have removed their eyes from her to him; and with good reason. For to see a man of a nature greater than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and having nought of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> upon earth, is more admirable than to see a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> decked with finery. For such indeed one may see both in theaters, and in pageants, and at baths, and many places; but whoso sees a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with bonds upon him, and deeming himself to have the greatest of ornaments, and not giving way under his bonds, does not behold a spectacle of earth, but one worthy of the heavens. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is in that way attired looks about&mdash;who has seen? Who not seen?&mdash; is filled with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, is possessed with anxious thoughts, is bound with countless other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: but he that has these bonds on him, is without <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>: his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> exults, is freed from every anxious care, is joyous, has its gaze on heaven, is clad with wings. If any one were to give me the choice of seeing <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> either stooping out of heaven, and uttering his voice, or out of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, I would choose the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. For they of heaven visit him when he is in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. The bonds of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> were the bond of the Preaching, that chain of his was its foundation. Long we for those bonds!</p>

<p>And how, some one says, may this be? If we break up and dash in pieces these. No good results to us from these bonds, but even harm. These will show us as prisoners There; but the bonds of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> will loose those bonds; she that is bound with these here, with those deathless bonds shall she also be bound There, both hands and feet; she that has been bound with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a>, shall have them in that day as it were an ornament about her. Free both yourself from your bonds, and the poor man from his hunger. Why do you rivet fast the chains of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Some one says, How? When you wear gold while another is perishing, when thou, to get you vainglory, takest so much gold, while another hast not even what to eat, have you not wedged fast your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Put Christ about you, and not gold; where Mammon is, there Christ is not, where Christ is, there Mammon is not. Would you not put on the King of all Himself? If one had offered you the purple, and the diadem, would you not have taken them before all the gold in the world? I give you not the regal ornaments, but I offer you to put on the King Himself. And how can one put Christ on, does any say? Hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saying, <q>As many of you as were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ, did put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians 3:27</a></span> Hear the Apostolical precept, <q>Make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans 13:14</a></span> Thus does one put on Christ, if one provide not for the flesh unto its <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. If you have put on Christ, even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> will <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> you; but if gold, even men will laugh you to scorn: if you have put on Christ, men also will reverence you.</p>

<p>Would you appear fair and comely? Be content with the Creator's fashioning. Why do you overlay these bits of gold, as if about to put to rights God's creation? Would you appear comely? Clothe you in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; clothe you in benevolence; clothe you in modesty, humbleness. These are all more precious than gold; these make even the beautiful yet more comely; these make even the ill formed to be well formed. For when any one looks upon a countenance with good will, he gives his judgment from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, even though she be beautiful, none can call beautiful; for the mind being confounded pronounces not its sentence aright.</p>

<p>That <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of old was adorned; Joseph too was adorned; which of them was the more beautiful? I say not when she was in the palace, and he in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.  He was naked, but clothed in the garments of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; she was clothed, but more unseemly than if she had been naked; for she had not modesty. When you have excessively adorned you, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, then you have become more unseemly than a naked one; for you have stripped you of your fair adorning. Eve also was naked; but when she had clothed herself, then was she more unseemly, for when she was naked indeed, she was adorned with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but when she had clothed herself with the garment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, then was she unseemly. And thou, when arraying yourself in the garment of studied finery, dost then appear more unseemly. For that costliness avails not to make any appear beautiful, but that it is possible even for one dressed out to be even more unseemly than if naked, tell me now; if you had ever put on the dresses of a piper or a flute-player, would it not have been unseemliness? And yet those dresses are of gold; but for this very reason it were unseemliness, because they are of gold. For the costliness suits well with people on the stage, tragedians, players, mimes, dancers, fighters with wild beasts; but to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that is a believer, there are given other robes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Only-Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself. <q>For,</q> he says, <q>as many as were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ, did put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians 3:27</a></span> Tell me, if one had given you kingly apparel, and you had taken a beggar's  dress, and put this on above it, would you not, besides the unseemliness, have also been punished for it? You have put on the Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and of the Angels, and are you still busied about earth?</p>

<p>I have spoken thus, because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of ornament is of itself a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, even were no other gendered by it, and it were possible to hold it without peril, (for it incites to vainglory and to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>,) but now many other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are gendered by finery, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suspicions, unseasonable expenses, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speakings, occasions of rapacity. For why do you adorn yourself? Tell me. Is it that you may please your husband? Then do it at home. But here the reverse is the case. For if you would please your own husband, please not others; but if you please others, you will not be able to please your own. So that you should put away all your ornaments, when you go to the forum or proceedest to the church. Besides, please not your husband by those means which harlots use, but by those rather which wives that are free employ. For wherein, tell me, does a wife differ from a harlot? In that the one regards one thing only, namely, that by the beauty of her person she may attract to herself him whom she loves; while the other both rules the house, and shares in the children, and in all other things.</p>

<p>Have you a little daughter? Look to it lest she inherit the mischief, for they are wont to form their manners according to their nurture, and to imitate their mothers' behavior. Be a pattern to your daughter of modesty, deck yourself with that adorning, and see that thou despise the other; for that is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> an ornament, the other a disfigurement. Enough has been said. Now God that made the world, and has given to us the ornament  of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, adorn us, and clothe us with His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that all shining brightly in good works, and living unto His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, we may send up <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now and always, etc.</p>
