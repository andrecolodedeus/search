<h1>Homily 10 on the First Epistle of John</h1>

<h2>1 John 5:1-3</h2>

<p><q>Whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves Him that begot Him, loves Him also that is begotten of Him. By this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do His commandments. For this is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God that we keep His commandments.</q></p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">I Suppose</span> ye remember, those of you who were present yesterday, to what place in the course of this epistle our exposition has reached: namely, <q>He that loves not his brother whom he sees, how can he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God whom he sees not? And this commandment have we from Him, That he who loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his brother also.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172486"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:20-21</a></span> Thus far we discoursed. Let us see then what comes next in order. <q>Whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172487"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:1</a></span> Who is he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ? He that does not so live as Christ commanded. For many say, <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>:</q> but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without works saves not. Now the work of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is Love, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle says, <q>And <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172488"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> Your past works indeed, before you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, were either none, or if they seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, were nothing worth. For if they were none, you were as a man without feet, or with sore feet unable to walk: but if they seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, before you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, you ran indeed, but by running aside from the way you went astray instead of coming to the goal. It is for us, then, both to run, and to run in the way. He that runs aside from the way, runs to no purpose, or rather runs but to toil. He goes the more astray, the more he runs aside from the way. What is the way by which we run? Christ has told us, <q>I am the Way.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172489"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> What the home to which we run? <q>I am the Truth.</q> By Him you run, to Him you run, in Him you rest. But, that we might run by Him, He reached even unto us: for we were afar off, foreigners in a far country. Not enough that we were in a far country, we were feeble also that we could not stir. A Physician, He came to the sick: a Way, He extended Himself to them that were in a far country. Let us be saved by Him, let us walk in Him. This it is to <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, who are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> only in name, but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and in life, not as the devils <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For <q>the devils also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and tremble,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172490"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse19">James&nbsp;2:19</a></span> as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> tells us. What more could the devils <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, than that they should say, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who you are, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</q>  What the devils said, the same said Peter also. When the Lord asked them who He was, and whom did men say that He was, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> made answer to Him, <q>Some say that you are John the Baptist; some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. He says unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter answered and said, You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the Living God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172492"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;16:13-18</a></span> And this he heard from the Lord: <q>Blessed are you, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you, but my Father which is in heaven.</q> See what praises follow this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my Church.</q> What means, <q>Upon this rock I will build my Church</q>? Upon this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; upon this that has been said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the Living God. Upon this rock,</q> says He, <q>I will build my Church.</q> Mighty praise! So then, Peter says, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the Living God:</q> the devils also say, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who you are, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> This Peter said, this also the devils: the words the same, the mind not the same. And how is it clear that Peter said this with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Because a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. How without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Peter said this, that he might embrace Christ; the devils said it, that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> might depart from them. For before they said, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who you are, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> they said, <q>What have we to do with you? Why are you come to destroy us before the time?</q> It is one thing then to confess Christ that you may hold Christ, another thing to confess Christ that you may drive Christ from you. So then ye see, that in the sense in which he here says, <q>Whoso <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>,</q> it is a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of one's own, not as one has a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in common with many. Therefore, brethren, let none of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> say to you, <q>We also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> For to this end have I given you an instance from the case of devils, that you may not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the words of believing, but search well the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the life.</p>

<p>2. Let us see then what it is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ; what to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, He is the Christ. He proceeds: <q>Whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> But what is it to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that? <q>And every one that loves Him that begot Him, loves Him also that is begotten of Him.</q> To <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he has straightway joined <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is nothing worth. With <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: but those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, are worse than devils, more stupid than devils. Some man will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ: so far, he is not even upon a par with devils. A person does now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> Christ: he has the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment, not in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the crown: thus the devils also feared to be punished. Add to this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that it may become a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> such as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> speaks of, a <q><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172493"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> you have found a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, found a citizen of Jerusalem, found a fellow-citizen of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, found a pilgrim sighing in the way: join yourself to him, he is your fellow-traveller, run with him, if indeed you also art this. <q>Every one that loves Him that begot Him, loves Him also that is begotten of Him.</q> Who <q>begot</q>? The Father. Who <q>is begotten</q>? The Son. What says he then? <q>Every one that loves the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, loves the Son.</q></p>

<p>3. <q>In this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172494"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:2</a></span> What is this, brethren? Just now he was speaking of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, not of sons of God: lo, here one Christ was set before us to contemplate, and we were told, <q>Whosoever <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loves Him that begot,</q> <em>i.e.</em> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>loves Him also that is begotten of Him,</q> <em>i.e.</em> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. And he goes on: <q>In this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> as if he had been about to say, <q>In this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> He has said, <q>the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> whereas he was speaking just before of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; because the sons of God are the Body of the Only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and when He is the Head, we the members, it is one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. Therefore, he that loves the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and he that loves the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, loves the Father; nor can any <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Father except he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he that loves the sons, loves also the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. What sons of God? The members of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And by loving he becomes himself a member, and comes through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to be in the frame of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so there shall be one Christ, loving Himself. For when the members <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, the body loves itself. <q>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, all the members <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172495"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:26-27</a></span> And then he goes on to say, <q>Now you are the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and members.</q> John was speaking just before of brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and said, <q>He that loves not his brother whom he sees, how can he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God whom he sees not?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172496"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:20</a></span> But if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your brother, haply you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your brother and lovest not Christ? How should that be, when you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> members of Christ? When therefore you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ; when you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; when you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> also the Father. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> therefore cannot be separated into parts. Choose what you will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; the rest follow you. Suppose you say, I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God alone, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. You are lying: if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him not alone; but if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> also the Son. Behold, do you say, I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Son: but this only, the Father God and the Son <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that Word by which all things were made, and <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt in us:</q> this alone I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. You are lying; for if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Head, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> also the members; but if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the members, neither do you love the Head.

Now what are His members, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren: none other than the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. <q>In this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God.</q> And how? Are not the sons of God one thing, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself another? But he that loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, loves His precepts. And what are the precepts of God? <q>A new commandment give I unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172498"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34</a></span> Let none excuse himself by another <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for another <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; so and so only is it with this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: as the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself is compacted in one, so all that hang by it does it make one, and as fire melts them down into one. It is gold: the lump is molten and becomes some one thing. But unless the fervor of charity be applied, of many there can be no melting down into one. <q>That we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> by this <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>4. And by what do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the sons of God? By this, <q>that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do His commandments.</q> We sigh here, by reason of the hardness of doing the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Hear what follows. O man, at what do you toil in loving? In loving <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. With toil is that loved which you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: there is no toil in loving God. Avarice will enjoin you labors, perils, sore hardships and tribulations; and you will do its bidding. To what end? That you may have that with which you shall fill your chest, and lose your peace of mind. You felt yourself haply more secure before you had it, than since you began to have. See what <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> has enjoined you. You have filled your house, and art in dread of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>; hast gotten gold, lost your sleep. See what <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> has enjoined you. Do, and you did. What does God enjoin you! Love me. You love gold, you will seek gold, and perchance not find it: whoever seeks me, I am with him. You will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and perchance not attain unto it: who ever loved me, and did not attain? God says to you, you would make you a patron, or a powerful friend: you seek a way to his favor by means of another inferior. Love me, says God to you: favor with me is not had by making interest with some other: your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> itself makes me present to you. What sweeter than this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, brethren? It is not without reason that you heard just now in the Psalm, <q>The unrighteous told me of delights,  but not as is Your law, O Lord.</q>  What is the Law of God? The commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What is the commandment of God? That <q>new commandment,</q> which is called new because it makes new: <q>A new commandment give I unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172501"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34</a></span> Hear because this is the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The apostle says, <q>Bear ye one another's burdens, and so shall you fulfill the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172502"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;6:2</a></span> This, even this, is the consummation of all our works; Love. In it is the end: for this we run: to it we run; when we have come to it, we shall rest.</p>

<p>5. You have heard in the Psalm, <q>I have seen the end of all perfection.</q>  He has said, I have seen the end of all perfection: what had he seen? Think we, had he ascended to the peak of some very high and pointed mountain, and looked out thence and seen the compass of the earth, and the circles of the round world, and therefore said, <q>I have seen the end of all perfection</q>? If this be a thing to be praised, let us ask of the Lord eyes of the flesh so sharp-sighted, that we shall but require some exceeding high mountain on earth, that from its summit we may see the end of all perfection. Go not far: lo, I say to you, it is here; ascend the mountain, and see the end. Christ is the Mountain; come to Christ: you see thence the end of all perfection. What is this end? Ask <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: <q>But the end of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172504"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> and in another place, <q>Charity is the fullness,</q> or fulfillment, <q>of the law.</q> What so finished and terminated as <q>fullness</q>? For, brethren, the apostle here uses <em>end</em> in a way of praise. Think not of consumption, but of consummation. For it is in one sense that one says, I have finished my bread, in another, I have finished my coat. I have finished the bread, by eating it: the coat, by making it. In both places the word is <q>end,</q> <q>finish:</q> but the bread is finished by its being consumed, the coat is finished by being made: the bread, so as to be no more; the coat, so as to be complete. Therefore in this sense take ye also this word, end, when the Psalm is read and you hear it said, <q>On the end, a Psalm of David.</q>  You are for ever hearing this in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, and you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what ye hear. What means, <q>On the end</q>?&mdash; <q>For Christ is the end of the law unto every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172506"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> And what means, <q>Christ is the end</q>? Because Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <q>the end of the commandment is charity,</q> and <q>Charity is God:</q> because Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are One. There is He the End to you; elsewhere He is the Way. Do not stick fast in the way, and so never come to the end. Whatever else you come to, pass beyond it, until you come to the end. What is the end? It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me to <q>hold me fast in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Have you laid fast hold on God? You have finished the way: you shall abide in your own country. Mark well! Some man seeks money: let not it be the end to you: pass on, as a traveller in a strange land. But if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it, you are entangled by <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>; <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> will be shackles to your feet: you can make no more progress. Pass therefore this also: seek the end. You seek health of the body: still do not stop there. For what is it, this health of the body, which death makes an end of, which sickness debilitates, a feeble, mortal, fleeting thing? Seek that, indeed, lest haply ill-health hinder your good works: but for that very reason, the end is not there, for it is sought in order to something else. Whatever is sought in order to something else, the end is not there: whatever is loved for its own sake, and freely, the end is there. You seek <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>; perchance seekest them in order to do something, that you may accomplish something, and so please God: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> itself, lest you stop there. Do you seek praise? If you seek God's, you do well; if you seek your own, you do ill; you stop short in the way. But behold, you are loved, art praised: think it not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> when in yourself you are praised; be praised in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, that you may sing, <q>In the Lord shall my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be praised.</q>  Thou deliverest some good discourse, and your discourse is praised. Let it not be praised as yours, the end is not there. If you set the end there, there is an end of you: but an end, not that you be perfected, but that you be consumed. Then let not your discourse be praised as coming from you, as being yours. But how praised? As the Psalm says, <q>In God will I praise the discourse, in God will I praise the word.</q>  Hereby shall that which there follows come to pass in you: <q>In God have I hoped, I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man can do unto me.</q>  For when all things that are yours are praised in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest your praise be lost, since God fails not. Pass therefore this also.</p>

<p>6. See, brethren, how many things we pass, in which is not the end. These we use as by the way; we take as it were our refreshment at the halting places on our journey, and pass on.  Where then is the end? <q>Beloved, we are sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172512"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> here is this said, in this epistle. As yet then, we are on the way; as yet, wherever we come, we must pass on, until we attain unto some end. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. That is the end; there perpetual praising, there <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>  always without fail. This, then is the end he has spoken of in the Psalm: <q>I have seen the end of all perfection:</q>  and as though it were said to him, What is the end you have seen? <q>Your commandment, exceeding broad.</q> This is the end: the breadth of the commandment. The breadth of the commandment is charity, because where charity is, there are no straits. In this breadth, this wide room, was the apostle when he said, <q>Our mouth is open to you, O you Corinthians, our heart is enlarged: you are not straitened in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172515"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:11-12</a></span> In this, then, is <q>Your commandment exceeding broad.</q> What is the broad commandment? <q>A new commandment give I unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> Charity, then, is not straitened. Would you not be straitened here on earth? Dwell in the broad room. For whatever man may do to you, he shall not straiten you; because you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that which man cannot hurt: lovest <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lovest the brotherhood, lovest the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, lovest the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>: it shall be for ever. Thou laborest here on earth, but you shall come to the promised enjoyment. Who can take from you that which you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? If no man can take from you that which you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, secure you sleep, or rather secure you watch, lest by sleeping you lose that which you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For not without reason is it said, <q>Enlighten my eyes, lest at any time I sleep in death.</q>  They that shut their eyes against charity, fall asleep in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of carnal delights. Be wakeful, therefore. For then are the delights, to eat, to drink, to wanton in luxury, to play, to hunt; these vain pomps all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> follow. Are we <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that they are delights? Who can deny that they delight? But more beloved is the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Cry against such persuaders: <q>The unrighteous have told me of delights: but not so as is your law, O Lord.</q>  This delight remains. Not only remains as the goal to which you may come, but also calls you back when you flee.</p>

<p>7. <q>For this is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we keep His commandments.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172518"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:3</a></span> Already you have heard, <q>On these two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> See how He would not have you divide yourself over a multitude of pages: <q>On these two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> On what two commandments? <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your mind. And, you shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172519"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;22:37-40</a></span> See here of what commandments this whole epis tle talks. Therefore hold fast <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and set your minds at rest. Why do you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest you do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to some man? Who does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the man he loves? Love : it is impossible to do this without doing good. But it may be, you rebuke. Kindness  does it, not fierceness. But it may be thou beatest. For discipline you do this; because your kindness of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>  will not let you leave him undisciplined. And indeed there come somehow these different and contrary results, that sometimes <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> uses winning ways, and charity shows itself fierce. A person <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his enemy, and feigns friendship for him: he sees him doing some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he praises him: he wishes him to go headlong, wishes him to go blind over the precipice of his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, haply never to return; he praises him, <q>For the sinner is praised in the desires of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;</q>  he applies to him the unction of adulation; behold, he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, and praises. Another sees his friend doing something of the same sort; he calls him back; if he will not hear, he uses words even of castigation, he scolds, he quarrels:  there are times when it comes to this, that one must even quarrel! Behold, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> shows itself winningly gentle, and charity quarrels! Stay not your regard upon the words of seeming kindness, or the seeming cruelty of the rebuke; look into the vein  they come from; seek the root whence they proceed. The one is gentle and bland that he may deceive, the other quarrels that he may correct. Well then, it is not for us, brethren, to enlarge your heart: obtain from God the gift to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another. Love all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even your enemies, not because they are your brethren, but that they may be your brethren; that you may be at all times on fire with brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, whether toward him that has become your brother, or towards your enemy, so that, by being beloved, he may become your brother. Wheresoever ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a brother, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a friend. Now is he with you, now is he knit to you in unity, yea catholic unity. If you are living aright, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a brother made out of an enemy. But you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> some man who has not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Christ, or, if he have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, believes as do the devils: you rebuke his vanity. <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">Love</a>, and that with a brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: he is not yet a brother, but you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the end he may be a brother. Well then, all our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is a brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, towards <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, towards all His members. The discipline of charity, my brethren, its strength, flowers, fruit, beauty, pleasantness, food, drink, meat, embracing, has in it no satiety. If it so delight us while in a strange land, in our own country how shall we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>!</p>

<p>8. Let us run then, my brethren, let us run, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ. What Christ? <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Who is He? The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. And how came He to the sick? <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172526"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> It is complete then, which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> foretold, <q>Christ must suffer, and rise again the third day from the dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172527"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;24:46</a></span> His body, where is it? His members, where toil they? Where must you be, that you may be under your Head? <q>And that repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be preached in His name through all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172528"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;24:47</a></span> There let your charity be spread abroad. Christ says, and the Psalm, <em>i.e.</em> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, <q>Your commandment is exceeding broad:</q> and forsooth some man will have charity to be confined to Africa! Extend your charity over the whole earth if you will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for Christ's members are over all the earth. If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> but a part, you are divided: if you are divided, you are not in the body; if you are not in the body, you are not under the Head. What profits it you that you believe  and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>? Thou adorest Him in the Head, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him in the Body. He loves His Body. If you have cut yourself off from His Body, the Head has not cut itself off from its Body. To no purpose do you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> me, cries your Head to you from on high, to no purpose do you <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> me. It is all one as if a man would <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> your head and tread upon your feet: perchance with nailed boots he would crush your feet, while he will clasp your head and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> it: would you not cry out in the midst of the words with which he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> you, and say, What are you doing, man? You tread on me. You would not mean, Thou treadest on my head; for the head he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>; but more would the head cry out for the members trodden upon, than for itself because it was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. Does not the head itself cry out, I will none of yours <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; do not tread on me? Now say if you can, How have I trodden upon you? Say that to the head: I wanted to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> you, I wanted to embrace you. But do you not see, O fool, that what you would embrace does in virtue of a certain unity, which knits the whole frame together, reach to that which you tread upon? Above  you honor me, beneath  you tread upon me. That on which you tread pains more than that which you honor rejoices. In what sort does the tongue cry out? <q>It hurts me.</q> It says not, <q>It hurts my foot,</q> but, <q>It hurts me,</q> says it. O tongue, who has touched you? Who has struck? Who has goaded? Who has pricked? No man, but I am knit together with the parts that are trodden upon. How would you have me not be pained, when I am not separate?</p>

<p>9. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, then, ascending into heaven on the fortieth day, did for this reason commend to us His Body where it would continue to lie, because He saw that many would <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Him for that He is ascended into heaven: and saw that their honoring Him is useless if they trample upon His members here on earth. And lest any one should <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, and, while he adored the Head in heaven should trample upon the feet on earth, He told us where would be His members. For being about to ascend, He spoke His last words on earth: after those same words He spoke no more on earth. The Head about to ascend into heaven commended to us His members on earth and departed. Thenceforth you find not Christ speaking on earth; you find Him speaking, but from heaven. And even from heaven, why? Because His members on earth were trodden upon. For to the persecutor Saul He said from on high, <q>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172532"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4</a></span> I am ascended into heaven, but still I lie on earth: here I sit at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but there I yet hunger, thirst, and am a stranger. In what manner then did He commend to us His Body, when about to ascend into heaven? When the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> asked Him, saying, <q>Lord, will you at this time present  yourself, and when shall be the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172534"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse6">Acts&nbsp;1:6-8</a></span> He made answer, now at the point to depart, <q>It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the time which the Father has put in His own power: but you shall receive strength of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> coming upon you, and you shall be witnesses to me.</q> See where His Body is spread abroad, see where He will not be trodden upon: <q>You shall be witnesses to me, unto Jerusalem, and unto <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and even unto all the earth.</q> Lo, where I lie that am ascending! For I ascend, because I am the Head: my Body lies yet beneath. Where lies? Throughout the whole earth. Beware you strike not, beware you hurt not, beware you trample not: these be the last words of Christ about to go into heaven. Look at a sick man languishing on his bed, lying in his house, and worn out with sickness, at death's door, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as it were even now between his teeth: who, anxious, it may be, about something that is dear to him, which he greatly loves, and it comes into his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, calls his heirs, and says to them, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, do this. He, as it were, detains his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by a violent effort, that it may not depart ere those words be made sure. When he has dictated those last words, he breathes out his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he is borne a corpse to the sepulchre. His heirs, how do they remember the last words of the dying man? How, if one should stand up and say to them, Do it not: what would they say? <q>What? Shall I not do that which my father, in the act of breathing out his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, commanded me with his last breath, the last word of his that sounded in my ears when my father was departing this life? Whatever other words of his I may not regard, his last have a stronger hold upon me: since which I never saw him more, never more heard speech of his.</q> Brethren, think with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> hearts; if to the heirs of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, his words spoken when about to go to the tomb are so sweet, so grateful, so weighty, what must we account of the last words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, spoken not when about to go back to the tomb, but to ascend into heaven! As for the man who lived and is dead, his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is hurried off to other places, his body is laid in the earth, and whether these words of his be done or not, makes no difference to him: he has now something else to do, or something else to suffer: either in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom he rejoices, or in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> he longs for a drop of water, while his corpse lies there senseless in the sepulchre; and yet the last words of the dying man are kept. What have those to look for, who keep not the last words of Him that sits in heaven, who sees from on high whether they be despised or not despised? The words of Him, who said, <q>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</q> who keeps account, unto the judgment, of all that He sees His members suffer?</p>

<p>10. And what have we done, say they? We are the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, not the persecutors. You are the persecutors, O wretched men. In the first place, in that you have divided the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Mightier the sword of the tongue than the sword of steel. Agar, Sarah's maid, was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and she was afflicted by her mistress for her <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. That was discipline, not punishment.  Accordingly, when she had gone away from her mistress, what said the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to her? <q>Return to your mistress.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172536"><a href="../bible/gen016.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;16:4-9</a></span> Then, O carnal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, like a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, suppose you have suffered any trouble for discipline' sake, why do you rave? <q>Return to your mistress,</q> hold fast the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  Lo, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> are pro duced, we read where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is spread abroad: men dispute against us, and say to us, <q>Betrayers!</q>  Betrayers of what? Christ commends to us His Church, and you believe not: shall I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you, when you revile my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>? Would you that I should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you about the <q>betrayers</q>? First <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Christ. What is worth believing? Christ is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you are man: which ought to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> first? Christ has spread His Church abroad over all the earth: I say it&mdash; despise me: the gospel speaks&mdash; beware. What says the gospel? <q>It behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead on the third day, and that repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in His name.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172539"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;24:47</a></span> Where remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, there the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is.

But, because you are well aware that if you shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you will not have anything to say about <q>betrayers,</q> you will needs have me to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you when you speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, rather than yourself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what Christ foretold!</p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The remainder of the Homily is wanting in all the manuscripts. It seems also that St. Augustine was hindered from completing the exposition of the entire epistle, as he had undertaken to do: at least Possidius specifies this work under the title, <q> <em>In Epist. Joannis ad Parthos Tractatus decem</em>,</q> and it is scarcely likely that the whole of the fifth chapter was expounded in this tenth Homily.&mdash; Of the <q>Sermons,</q> there are none upon the remaining part of this epistle: the following extracts from other works of St. Augustine will supply what will be most desiderated: namely, his exposition of the text on <q>the Three Witnesses,</q> of <q>the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto death,</q> and of the twentieth verse.</span> </p>
