<h1>Homily 11 on Second Corinthians</h1>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:11</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> therefore the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, we persuade men but we are made manifest unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> therefore, he says, these things, that terrible seat of judgment, we do every thing so as not to give you a handle nor offense, nor any false suspicion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> practice against us. Do you see the strictness of life, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of a watchful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? 'For we are not only open to accusation,' he says 'if we commit any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a>; but even if we do not commit, yet are suspected, and having it in our power to repel the suspicion, brave it, we are punished.'</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:12</h2>

<p><q>We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but speak as giving you occasion of glorying in our behalf.</q></p>

<p>See how he is continually obviating the suspicion of appearing to praise himself. For nothing is so offensive to the hearers as for any one to say great and marvellous things about himself. Since then he was compelled in what he said to fall upon that subject, he uses a corrective, saying, 'we do this for your sakes, not for ours, that you may have somewhat to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of, not that we may.' And not even this absolutely, but because of the false Apostles. Wherefore also he added, <q>To answer them that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in appearance, and not in heart.</q> Do you see how he has detached them from them, and drawn them to himself; having shown that even the Corinthians themselves are longing to get hold of some occasion, whereby they may have it in their power to speak on their  behalf and to defend them unto their accusers. For, says he, 'we say these things not that we may boast, but that you may have wherein to speak freely on our behalf;' which is the language of one testifying to their great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: 'and not that you may boast merely: but that you may not be drawn aside.' But this he does not say explicitly, but manages his words otherwise and in a gentler form, and without dealing them a blow, saying,</p>

<p><q>That ye may have somewhat to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> towards those which <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in appearance.</q> But neither this does he bid them do absolutely, when no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> exists, but when they  extol themselves; for in all things he looks out for the fitting occasion. He does not then do this in order to show himself to be illustrious, but to stop those men who were using the thing  improperly and to the injury of these. But what is <q>in appearance?</q> In what is seen, in what is for display. For of such sort were they, doing every thing out of a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, while they were both empty inwardly and wore indeed an appearance of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and of venerable seeming, but of good works were destitute.</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:13</h2>

<p>2. <q>For whether we are beside ourselves, it is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or whether we are of sober <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it is unto you.</q></p>

<p>And if, says he, we have uttered any great thing, (for this is what he here calls being beside himself, as therefore in other places also he calls it folly <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse1">2 Corinthians 11:1, 17, 21</a></span>) for God's sake we do this, lest ye thinking us to be worthless should despise us and perish; or if again any modest and lowly thing, it is for your sakes that you may learn to be lowly-minded. Or else, again, he means this. If any one thinks us to be mad, we seek for our reward from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for Whose sake we are of this suspected; but if he thinks us sober, let him reap the advantage of our soberness. And again, in another way. Does any one say we are mad? For God's sake are we in such sort mad. Wherefore also he subjoins;</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:14</h2>

<p><q>For the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God  constrains us, because we thus judge.</q></p>

<p>'For not the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of things to come only,' he says, 'but also those which have already happened allow us not to be <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> nor to slumber; but stir us up and impel us to these our labors on your behalf.' And what are those things which have already happened?</p>

<p><q>That if one died for all, then all died.</q> 'Surely then it was because all were lost,' says he. For except all were dead, He had not died for all.  For here the opportunities  of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> exist; but there are found no longer. Therefore, he says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God constrains us,</q> and allows us not to be at rest. For it comes of extreme wretchedness and is worse than <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> itself, that when He has set forth an act so mighty, any should be found after so great an instance of His provident care reaping no benefit. For great was the excess of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, both to die for a world of such extent , and dying for it when in such a state.</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:15</h2>

<p><q>That they which live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto Him who for their sakes died and rose again.</q></p>

<p>If therefore we ought not to live unto ourselves, 'be not troubled,' says he, 'nor be confounded when dangers and deaths assail you.' And he assigns besides an indubitable argument by which he shows that the thing is a debt. For if through Him we live who were dead; to Him we ought to live through Whom we live. And what is said appears indeed to be one thing, but if any one accurately examine it, it is two: one that we live by Him, another that He died for us: either of which even by itself is enough to make us liable; but when even both are united consider how great the debt is. Yea, rather, there are three things here. For the First-fruits also for your sake He raised up, and led up to heaven: wherefore also he added, <q>Who for our sakes died and rose again.</q></p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:16</h2>

<p>3. <q>Wherefore we henceforth <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no man after the flesh.</q></p>

<p>For if all died and all rose again; and in such sort died as the tyranny of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> condemned them; but rose again <q>through the laver of regeneration and the renewing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5</a></span> he says with reason, <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> none</q> of the faithful <q>after the flesh.</q> For what if even they be in the flesh? Yet is that fleshly life destroyed, and we are born again  by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and have learned another deportment and rule and life and condition , that, namely, in the heavens. And again of this itself he shows Christ to be the Author. Wherefore also he added,</p>

<p><q>Even though we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ after the flesh, yet now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him so no more.</q></p>

<p>What then? Tell me. Did He put away the flesh, and is He now not with that body? Away with the thought, for He is even now clothed in flesh; for this Jesus Who is taken up from you into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> shall so come. So? How? In flesh, with His body. How then does he say, <q>Even though we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth no more?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse11">Acts 1:11</a></span> For in us indeed <q>after the flesh</q> is being in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and <q>not after the flesh</q> not being in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>after the flesh</q> is His being subject to the affections of nature, such as to thirst, to hunger, to weariness, to sleep. For <q>He did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was guile found in His mouth.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1 Peter 2:22</a></span> Wherefore He also said, <q>Which of you convicts Me of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse46">John 8:46</a></span> and again, <q>The prince of this world comes, and he has nothing in Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse30">John 14:30</a></span> And <q>not after the flesh</q> is being thenceforward freed even from these things, not the being without flesh. For with this also He comes to judge the world, His being impassible and pure. Whereunto we also shall advance when <q>our body</q> has been <q>fashioned like His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> body.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse21">Philippians 3:21</a></span></p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:17</h2>

<p>4. <q>Wherefore if any man is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he is a new creature.</q></p>

<p>For seeing he had exhorted unto <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, he now leads them on to this from what has been actually done for them; wherefore also he added, <q>If any man is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> he is <q>a new creature.</q> <q>If any,</q> says he, <q>have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him, he has come to another creation, for he has been born again by the Spirit.</q> So that for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also, he says, we ought to live unto Him, not because we are not our own only, nor because He died for us only, nor because He raised up our First-fruits only, but because we have also come unto another life. See how many just grounds he urges for a life of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For on this account he also calls the reformation by a grosser name , in order to show the transition and the change to be great. Then following out farther what he had said, and showing how it is <q>a new creation,</q> he adds, <q>The old things are passed away, behold, all things are  become new.</q></p>

<p>What old things? He means either <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and impieties, or else all the Judaical observances. Yea rather, he means both the one and the other. <q>Behold, all things have become new.</q></p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:18</h2>

<p><q>But all things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>Nothing of ourselves. For remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and adoption and unspeakable <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> are given to us by Him. For he exhorts them no longer from the things to come only, but even from those now present. For consider. He said, that we shall be raised again, and go on unto incorruption, and have an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> house; but since present things have more force to persuade than things to come, with those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not in these as they ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, he shows how great things they have even already received, and being themselves what. What then being, received they them? Dead all; (for he says, <q>all died;</q> and, <q>He died for all;</q> so loved He all alike;) inveterate all, and grown old in their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. But behold, both a new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, (for it was cleansed,) and a new body, and a new worship, and promises new, and covenant, and life, and table, and dress, and all things new absolutely.  For instead of the Jerusalem below we have received that mother city which is above <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse26">Galatians 4:26</a></span>; and instead of a material temple have seen a spiritual temple; instead of tables of stone, fleshy ones; instead of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; instead of the manna, the Lord's body; instead of water from a rock, blood from His side; instead of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> or <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> rod, the Cross; instead of the promised [land] , the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; instead of a thousand <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, One High Priest; instead of a lamb without reason , a Spiritual Lamb. With these and such like things in his thought he said, <q>all things are new.</q> But <q>all</q> these <q>things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> by Christ, and His free gift. Wherefore also he added,</p>

<p><q>Who reconciled us to Himself through Christ, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation.</q></p>

<p>For from Him are all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. For He that made us friends is Himself also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the other things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given to His friends. For He rendered not these things unto us, allowing us to continue enemies, but having made us friends unto Himself. But when I say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our reconciliation, I say the Father is so also: when I say that the Father gave, I say the Son gave also. <q>For all things were made by Him;</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John 1:3</a></span> and of this too He is the Author. For we ran not unto Him, but He Himself called us. How called He us? By the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p><q>And gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation.</q></p>

<p>Here again he sets forth the dignity of the Apostles; showing how great a thing was committed to their hands, and the surpassing greatness of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For even when they would not hear the Ambassador that came, He was not exasperated nor left them to themselves, but continues to exhort them both in His own person and by others. Who can be fittingly amazed at this solicitude? The Son Who came to reconcile, His True and Only-Begotten, was slain, yet not even so did the Father turn away from His murderers; nor say, <q>I sent My Son as an Ambassador, but they not only would not hear Him, but even slew and crucified Him, it is meet henceforth to leave them to themselves:</q> but quite the contrary, when the Son departed, He entrusted the business to us; for he says, gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation.</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:19</h2>

<p>5. <q>To wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto Himself, not reckoning unto them their tresspasses.</q></p>

<p>Do you see <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> surpassing all expression, all conception? Who was the aggrieved one? Himself. Who first sought the reconciliation? Himself. 'And yet,' says one, 'He sent the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He did not come Himself.' The Son indeed it was He sent; still not He alone besought, but both with Him and by Him the Father; wherefore he said, that, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was reconciling the world unto Himself in Christ:</q> that is, by Christ.  For seeing he had said, <q>Who gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation;</q> he here used a corrective, saying, <q>Think not that we act of our own authority  in the business: we are ministers; and He that does the whole is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who reconciled the world by the Only-Begotten.</q> And how did He reconcile it unto Himself? For this is the marvel, not that it was made a friend only, but also by this way a friend. This way? What way? Forgiving them their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for in no other way was it possible. Wherefore also he added, <q>Not reckoning unto them their tresspasses.</q> For had it been His pleasure to require an account of the things we had transgressed in, we should all have perished; for <q>all died.</q> But nevertheless though our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were so great, He not only did not require satisfaction, but even became reconciled; He not only forgave, but He did not even <q>reckon.</q> So ought we also to forgive our enemies, that ourselves too may obtain the like forgiveness.</p>

<p><q>And having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</q></p>

<p>For neither have we come now on any odious office; but to make all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> friends with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For He says, 'Since they were not persuaded by Me, do ye continue beseeching until you have persuaded them.' Wherefore also he added,</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:20</h2>

<p><q>We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as though God were entreating by us; we beseech you on behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, be ye reconciled to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>Do you see how he has extolled the thing by introducing Christ thus in the form of a suppliant ; yea rather not Christ only, but even the Father? For what he says is this: 'The Father sent the Son to beseech, and to be His Ambassador unto <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. When then He was slain and gone, we succeeded to the embassy; and in His stead and the Father's we beseech you. So greatly does He prize <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> that He gave up even the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> He would be slain, and made us Apostles for your sakes; so that he said with reason, <q>All things are for your sakes.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse15">2 Corinthians 4:15</a></span> <q>We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> that is, instead of Christ; for we have succeeded to His functions.' But if this appears to you a great thing, hear also what follows wherein he shows that they do this not in His stead only, but also in stead of the Father. For therefore he also added, <q>As though God were entreating by us.</q> 'For not by the Son Himself only does He beseech, but also by us who have succeeded to the office of the Son. Think not therefore,' he says, 'that by us you are entreated; Christ Himself, the Father Himself of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, beseeches you by us. What can come up to this excess [of goodness]? He was outraged who had conferred innumerable benefits; having been outraged, He not only exacted not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but even gave His son that we might be reconciled. They that received Him were not reconciled, but even slew Him. Again, He sent other ambassadors to beseech, and though these are sent, it is Himself that entreats. And what does He entreat? <q>Be reconciled unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And he said not, 'Reconcile God to yourselves;' for it is not He that bears enmity, but you; for God never bears enmity. Urging moreover his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, like an ambassador on his mission,  he says,</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 5:21</h2>

<p><q>For Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He made to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on our account.</q></p>

<p>'I say nothing of what has gone before, that you have outraged Him, Him that had done you no wrong, Him that had done you good, that He exacted not <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that He is first to beseech, though first outraged; let none of these things be set down at present. Ought ye not in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to be reconciled for this one thing only that He has done to you now?' And what has He done? <q>Him that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> He made to be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for you.</q> For had He achieved nothing but done only this, think how great a thing it were to give His Son for those that had outraged Him. But now He has both well achieved mighty things, and besides, has suffered Him that did no wrong to be punished for those who had done wrong. But he did not say this: but mentioned that which is far greater than this. What then is this? <q>Him that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> he says, Him that was righteousness itself , <q>He made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> that is suffered as a sinner to be condemned, as one cursed to die. <q>For cursed is he that hangs on a tree.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians 3:13</a></span> For to die thus was far greater than to die; and this he also elsewhere implying, says, <q>Becoming <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> unto death, yea the death of the cross.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians 2:8</a></span> For this thing carried with it not only punishment, but also disgrace. Reflect therefore how great things He bestowed on you. For a great thing indeed it were for even a sinner to die for any one whatever; but when He who undergoes this both is righteous and dies for sinners; and not dies only, but even as one cursed; and not as cursed [dies] only, but thereby freely bestows upon us those great goods which we never looked for; (for he says, that <q>we might become the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Him;</q>) what words, what thought shall be adequate to realize these things? 'For the righteous,' says he, 'He made a sinner; that He might make the sinners righteous.' &nbsp;Yea rather, he said not even so, but what was greater far; for the word he employed is not the habit, but the quality itself. For he said not <q>made</q> [Him] a sinner, but <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> not, 'Him that had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>' only, but <q>that had not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that we</q> also <q>might become,</q> he did not say 'righteous,' but, <q>righteousness,</q> and, <q>the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For this is [the righteousness] <q>of God</q> when we are justified not by works, (in which case it were necessary that not a spot even should be found,) but by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, in which case all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is done away. And this at the same time that it suffers us not to be lifted up, (seeing the whole is the free gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,) teaches us also the greatness of that which is given. For that which was before was a righteousness of the Law and of works, but this is <q>the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>6. Reflecting then on these things, let us <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> these words more than <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; let us reverence the things [they express] more than the kingdom, and let us not deem it grievous to be punished, but to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For were He not to punish us, we ought to take vengeance on ourselves, who have been so ungrateful towards our Benefactor. Now he that has an object of affection, has often even slain himself, when unsuccessful in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and though successful, if he has been guilty of a fault towards her, counts it not fit that he should even live; and shall not we, when we outrage One so loving and gentle, cast ourselves into the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>? Shall I say something strange, and marvellous, and to many perhaps incredible? To one who has understanding and loves the Lord as it behooves to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, there will be greater comfort if punished after provoking One so loving, than if not punished. And this one may see by the common practice. For he that has wronged his dearest friend feels then the greatest relief, when he has wreaked vengeance on himself and suffered <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And accordingly David said, <q>I the shepherd have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and I the shepherd have done amiss; and these the flock, what have they done? Let Your hand be upon me, and upon my father's house.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2sa024.htm#verse17">2 Samuel 24:17</a>. <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> And when he lost Absalom he wreaked the extremest vengeance upon himself, although he was not the injurer but the injured; but nevertheless, because he loved the departed exceedingly, he racked himself with anguish, in this manner comforting himself. Let us therefore also, when we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against Him Whom we ought not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against, take vengeance on ourselves. See you not those who have lost true-born children, that they therefore both beat themselves and tear their hair, because to punish themselves for the sake of those they loved carries comfort with it. But if, when we have caused no harm to those dearest to us, to suffer because of what has befallen them brings consolation; when we ourselves are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have given provocation and wrong, will it not much rather be a relief to us to suffer the penalty and will not the being unpunished punish? Every one in a manner will see this. If any <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ as it behooves to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what I say; how, even when He forgives, he will not endure to go unpunished; for you undergo the severest punishment in having provoked Him. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed that I am speaking what will not be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by the many; but nevertheless it is so as I have said. If then we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ as it behooves to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, we shall punish ourselves when we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For to those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> any whomsover, not the suffering somewhat because they have provoked the beloved one is unpleasing; but above all, that they have provoked the person loved. And if this last when angered does not punish, he has tortured his lover more; but if he exacts satisfaction, he has comforted him rather. Let us therefore not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, but offending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is more grievous than that when He turns away in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: this is worse than all, this heavier than all. And that you may learn what a thing it is, consider this which I say. If one that was himself a king, beholding a robber and malefactor under punishment, gave his well-beloved son, his only-begotten and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, to be slain; and transferred the death and the guilt as well, from him to his son, (who was himself of no such character,) that he might both save the condemned man and clear him from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> ; and then if, having subsequently promoted him to great dignity, he had yet, after thus saving him and advancing him to that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> unspeakable, been outraged by the person that had received such treatment: would not that man, if he had any sense, have chosen ten thousand deaths rather than appear guilty of so great ingratitude? This then let us also now consider with ourselves, and groan bitterly for the provocations we have offered our Benefactor; nor let us therefore presume, because though outraged He bears it with long-suffering; but rather for this very reason be full of remorse.  For among men too, when one that has been smitten on the right cheek offers the left also, he more avenges himself than if he gave ten thousand blows; and when one that has been reviled, not only reviles not again but even blesses, he has stricken [his adversary] more heavily, than if he rained upon him ten thousand reproaches. Now if in the case of men we feel ashamed when offering insults we meet with long-suffering; much rather, in respect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ought they to be afraid who go on continually sinning yet suffer no calamity. For, even for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> unto their own heads is the unspeakable punishment treasured up for them. These things then bearing in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, let us above all things be afraid of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for this is punishment, this is <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, this is ten thousand ills. And let us not only be afraid of, but also flee from it, and strive to please God continually; for this is the kingdom, this is life, this is ten thousand goods. So shall we also even here obtain already the kingdom and the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come; whereunto may we all attain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards men of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; with Whom to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, might, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and for ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
