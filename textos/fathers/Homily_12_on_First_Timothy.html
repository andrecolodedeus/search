<h1>Homily 12 on First Timothy</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 4:1-3</a></strong></p>

<p> <em><q>Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> seared with a hot iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></em></p>

<p>As those who adhere to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are fixed on a safe anchor, so those who fall from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> can nowhere rest; but after many wanderings to and fro, they are borne at last into the very gulf of perdition. And this he had shown before, saying, that some had <q>already made shipwreck concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> and now he says, <q>Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, giving heed to seducing spirits.</q> This is said of the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>,  and the Marcionites, and the whole of their tribe,  that they should hereafter depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Do you see that this departure from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that follow!</p>

<p>But what is <q>expressly</q>? Plainly, clearly, and beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Marvel not, he says, if some having departed from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> still adhere to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Judaism</a>. There will be a time, when even those who have partaken of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will fall into a worse <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, not only with respect to meats, but to marriages, and other such things, introducing the most pernicious notions. This refers not to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, (for <q>the latter times,</q> and a <q>departure from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> is not applicable to them;) but to the Manichees, and the founders of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>. And he calls them very <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, <q>seducing spirits,</q> since it was by these they were actuated in speaking such things. <q>Speaking lies in hypocrisy.</q> This implies that they utter not these falsehoods through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and unknowingly, but as acting a part, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but <q>having their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> seared,</q> that is, being men of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lives.</p>

<p>But why does he speak only of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>? Christ had before said, <q>Offenses must need come</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse7">Matthew 18:7</a></span>, and he had predicted the same in his <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the sower, and of the springing up of the tares. But here admire with me the prophetic gift of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who, before the times in which they were to appear, specifies the time itself. As if he had said, Do not wonder, if, at the commencement of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, some endeavor to bring in these pernicious doctrines; since, after it has been established for a length of time, many shall depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats.</q> Why then has he mentioned no other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>? Though not particularized, they are implied by the expressions of <q>seducing spirits and doctrines of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</q> But he did not wish to instill these things into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> before the time; but that which had already commenced, the case of meats, he specifies. <q>Which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Why did he not say, by the unbelievers too? How by the unbelievers, when they exclude themselves from them by their own rules? But is not luxury forbidden? Certainly it is. But why? If <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are created to be received. Because He created bread, and yet too much is forbidden; and wine also, and yet excess is forbidden; and we are not commanded to avoid dainties as if they were unclean in themselves, but as they corrupt the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by excess.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse4">Ver. 4</a>. <q>For every creature of God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.</q></p>

<p>If it be the creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. For <q>all things,</q> it is said, <q>were very good.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse31">Genesis 1:31</a></span> By speaking thus of things eatable, he by anticipation impugns the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of those who introduce an uncreated matter, and assert that these things proceed from it. But if it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, why is it <q>sanctified by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a></q>? For it must be unclean, if it is to be sanctified? Not so, here he is speaking to those who thought that some of these things were common; therefore he lays down two positions: first, that no creature of God is unclean: secondly, that if it had become so, you have a remedy, seal it,  give thanks, and glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all the uncleanness passes away. Can we then so cleanse that which is offered to an idol? If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that it was so offered. But if, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, you partake of it, you will be unclean; not because it was offered to an idol, but because contrary to an express command, you thereby communicate with devils. So that it is not unclean by nature, but becomes so through your wilful disobedience. What then, is not swine's flesh unclean? By no means, when it is received with thanksgiving, and with the seal; nor is anything else. It is your unthankful disposition to God that is unclean.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse6">Ver. 6</a>. <q>If you put the brethren in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, nourished up in the words of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained.</q></p>

<p>What are the things here meant? The same which he had before mentioned, that <q>great is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a></q>; that to abstain from meats is the doctrine of devils, that they are <q>cleansed by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse7">Ver. 7</a>. <q>But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself rather unto godliness.</q></p>

<p><q>Putting them in remembrance,</q> he says; here you observe no authority; but all is condescension: he does not say <q>commanding</q> or <q>enjoining,</q> but reminding them: that is, suggest these things as matter of advice, and so enter into discourses with them concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <q>being nourished up,</q> he says, meaning to imply constancy in application to these things.</p>

<p>For as we set before us day by day this bodily nourishment, so he means, let us be continually receiving discourses concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and ever be nourished with them. What is this, <q>being nourished up</q>? Ruminating upon them; attending ever to the same things, and practicing ever the same, for it is no common nourishment that they supply.</p>

<p><q>But refuse profane and old wives' fables.</q> By these are meant Jewish traditions, and he calls them <q>fables,</q> either because of their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> or their unseasonableness. For what is seasonable is useful, but what is unseasonable is not only useless but injurious. Suppose a man of adult age to be suckled by a nurse, would he not be ridiculous, because it is unseasonable? <q>Profane and old wives' fables,</q> he calls them, partly because of their obsoleteness, and partly because they are impediments to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For to bring <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> under <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, that are raised above these things, is an impious commandment. <q>Exercise yourself unto godliness.</q> That is, unto a pure <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and a moral life; for this is godliness. So then we need <q>exercise.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse8">Ver. 8</a>. <q>For bodily exercise  profits little.</q> This has by some been referred to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; but away with such a notion! For that is not a bodily but a spiritual exercise. If it were bodily it would nourish the body, whereas it wastes and makes it lean, so that it is not bodily. Hence he is not speaking of the discipline  of the body. What we need, therefore, is the exercise  of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the exercise of the body has no profit, but may benefit the body a little, but the exercise  of godliness yields fruit and advantage both here and hereafter.</p>

<p><q>This is a faithful saying,</q> that is, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that godliness is profitable both here and hereafter. Observe how everywhere he brings in this, he needs no demonstration, but simply declares it, for he was addressing Timothy.</p>

<p>So then even here, we have good hopes? For he who is conscious to himself of no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and who has been fruitful in good, rejoices even here: as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man on the other hand is punished here as well as hereafter. He lives in perpetual <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he can look no one in the face with confidence, he is pale, trembling, and full of anxiety. Is it not so with the fraudulent, and with thieves, who have no satisfaction even in what they possess? Is not the life of murderers and adulterers most wretched, who look upon the sun itself with suspicion? Is this to be called life? No; rather a horrid death!</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse10">Ver. 10</a>. <q>For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the Saviour of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, specially of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q></p>

<p>This in effect is to say, wherefore do we mortify ourselves, unless we expect future blessings? Have we endured so many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, submitted to so many reproaches, suffered such insults and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, and such numerous calamities in vain? For if we did not trust in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on what account did we submit to these things? But if God is here the Saviour  of the unbelieving, much more is He of the faithful hereafter. What <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> does he speak of? That to come?  <q>Who is the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>,</q> he says, <q>of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, specially of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> At present he is speaking of that which is here. But how is He the Saviour of the faithful? Had he not been so, they must long since have been destroyed, for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon them. He calls him here to endure perils, that having God for his Saviour he may not faint nor need any aid from others, but willingly and with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> endure all things. Even those who eagerly grasp at worldly advantages, supported by the hope of gain, cheerfully undertake laborious enterprises.</p>

<p>It is then the last time. For <q>in the latter times,</q> he says, <q>some shall depart from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <q>Forbidding to marry.</q> And do not we forbid to marry? God forbid. We do not forbid those who wish to marry, but those who do not wish to marry, we exhort to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. It is one thing to forbid, and another to leave one to his own free choice. He that forbids, does it once for all, but he who recommends <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> as a higher state, does not forbid marriage, because he prefers <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>.</p>

<p><q>Forbidding to marry,</q> he says, <q>and commanding to abstain from meats, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> It is well said, <q>who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> The former things then were a type. For nothing is unclean by nature, but it becomes so through the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of him that partakes of it. And what was the object of the prohibition of so many meats? To restrain excessive luxury. But had it been said, <q>eat not for the sake of luxury,</q> it would not have been borne. They were therefore shut up under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the law, that they might abstain from the stronger principle of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. The fish was not forbidden, though it was manifestly more unclean than the swine. But they might have learned how pernicious luxury was from that saying of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 32:15</a></span> Another <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these prohibitions might be, that being straitened for other food, they might be reduced to slaughter sheep and oxen; he therefore restrained them from other things, on account of Apis and the calf, which was an abomination, ungrateful, polluted, and profane. </p>

<p><q>Put them in remembrance of these things, meditate upon  these things,</q> for by the expression, <q>nourished up in the words of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and sound doctrine,</q> is implied that he should not only recommend these things to others, but himself practice them. For he says, <q>Nourished up in the words of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained. But refuse profane and old wives' fables.</q> Why does he not say, abstain from them, but <q>refuse</q>? He thus intimates that they should be utterly rejected. His meaning is, that he should not enter into any disputation with the teachers of them, but recommend to his own people the things prescribed above. For nothing is to be gained by contending with perverse men, unless where it might have an injurious effect, if we were supposed from weakness to decline arguing with them.</p>

<p><q>But exercise yourself unto godliness,</q> that is, unto a pure life, and the most <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> conversation. He that exercises himself, even when it is not the season of contest, acts always as if he were contending, practices abstinence, endures all toils, is always anxious, endures much labor. <q>Exercise yourself,</q> he says, <q>unto godliness; for bodily exercise profits little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</q> And why, says one, does he mention this bodily exercise? To show by comparison the superiority of the other, in that the former is of no solid advantage, though it is attended with many toils, while the latter has a lasting and abundant good. As when he bids <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> <q>adorn themselves, not with broidered hair, or gold, or costly array: but which becomes <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> possessing godliness; with good works.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse9">1 Timothy 2:9-10</a></span></p>

<p> <em>Moral</em>. <q>This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation. For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach.</q> Did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> then suffer reproach, and are you impatient? Did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> labor, and would you live luxuriously? But had he lived luxuriously, he would never have attained such great blessings. For if worldly goods, which are uncertain and perishable, are never gained by men without labor and pains, much less are spiritual. Well, says one, but some inherit them. Yet even when inherited they are not guarded and preserved without labor, and care, and trouble, no less than those have that have gained them. And I need not say that many who have toiled and endured hardships have been disappointed at the very entrance of the harbor, and an adverse wind has caused the wreck of their hopes, when they were upon the point of possession. But with us there is nothing like this. For it is God who promised, and that <q>hope makes not ashamed.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans 5:5</a></span> You who are conversant with worldly affairs, do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many men, after <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> toils, have not enjoyed the fruit of their labors, either being previously cut off by death, or overtaken by misfortune, or assailed by disease, or ruined by false accusers, or some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, which amidst the variety of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> casualties, has forced them to go with empty hands?</p>

<p>But do you not see the lucky men, says one, who with little labor acquire the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of life? What <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? Money, houses, so many acres of land, trains of servants, heaps of gold and silver? Can you call these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and not hide your head for shame? A man called to the pursuit of heavenly wisdom, and gaping after worldly things, and calling them <q>goods,</q> which are of no value! If these things are good, then the possessors of them must be called good. For is not he good, who is the possessor of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? But when the possessors of these things are guilty of fraud and rapine, shall we call them good? For if <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is a good, but is increased by grasping, the more it is increased, the more will its possessor be considered to be good. Is the grasping man then good? But if <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and increases by grasping, the more a man grasps, the better he must be. Is not this plainly a contradiction? But suppose the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is not gained wrongfully. And how is this possible? So destructive a passion is <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, that to grow rich without <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is impossible. This Christ declared, saying, <q>Make to yourselves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse19">Luke 16:19</a></span> But what if he succeeded to his father's inheritance? Then he received what had been gathered by <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. For it was not from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> that his ancestor inherited riches, but, of the many that were before him, some one must probably have <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> taken and enjoyed the goods of others. What then? He says, did <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> hold unrighteous <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; and Job, that blameless, righteous, and faithful man, who <q>feared God and eschewed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q>? Theirs was a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> that consisted not in gold and silver, nor in houses, but in cattle. Besides this, he was enriched by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  And the author of that book, relating what happened to that blessed man, mentions the loss of his camels, his mares and asses, but does not speak of treasures of gold or silver being taken away. The riches of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> too were his domestics. What then? Did he not buy them? No, for to this very point the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, that the three hundred and eighteen were born in his house. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse14">Genesis 19:14</a></span> He had also sheep and oxen. Whence then did he send gold to Rebekah? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen024.htm#verse22">Genesis 24:22</a>; <a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse16">12:16</a></span> From the gifts which he received from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> without <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> or wrong.</p>

<p>Tell me, then, whence are you rich? From whom did you receive it, and from whom he who transmitted it to you? From his father and his grandfather. But can you, ascending through many generations, show the acquisition just? It cannot be. The root and origin of it must have been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>. Why? Because God in the beginning made not one man rich, and another poor. Nor did He afterwards take and show to one treasures of gold, and deny to the other the right of searching for it: but He left the earth free to all alike. Why then, if it is common, have you so many acres of land, while your neighbor has not a portion of it? It was transmitted to me by my father. And by whom to him? By his forefathers. But you must go back and find the original owner. Jacob had <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, but it was earned as the hire of his labors.</p>

<p>But I will not urge this argument too closely. Let your riches be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> gained, and without rapine. For you are not responsible for the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> acts of your father. Your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> may be derived from rapine; but you were not the plunderer. Or granting that he did not obtain it by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>, that his gold was cast up somewhere out of the earth. What then? Is <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> therefore good? By no means. At the same time it is not bad, he says, if its possessor be not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>; it is not bad, if it be distributed to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, otherwise it is bad, it is ensnaring. <q>But if he does not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, though he does no good, it is not bad,</q> he argues. True. But is not this an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that you alone should have the Lord's property, that you alone should enjoy what is common? Is not <q>the earth God's, and the fullness thereof</q>? If then our possessions belong to one common Lord, they belong also to our fellow-servants. The possessions of one Lord are all common. Do we not see this the settled rule in great houses? To all is given an equal portion of provisions, for it proceeds from the treasures of their Lord. And the house of the master is opened to all. The king's possessions are all common, as cities, market-places, and public walks. We all share them equally.</p>

<p>Mark the wise dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That He might put <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to shame, He has made certain things common, as the sun, air, earth, and water, the heaven, the sea, the light, the stars; whose benefits are dispensed equally to all as brethren. We are all formed with the same eyes, the same body, the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the same structure in all respects,  all things from the earth, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> from one man, and all in the same habitation. But these are not enough to shame us. Other things then (as we have said) He has made common, as baths, cities, market-places, walks. And observe, that concerning things that are common there is no contention, but all is peaceable. But when one attempts to possess himself of anything, to make it his own, then contention is introduced, as if nature herself were indignant, that when God brings us together in every way, we are eager to divide and separate ourselves by appropriating things, and by using those cold words <q>mine and yours.</q> Then there is contention and uneasiness. But where this is not, no strife or contention is bred. This state therefore is rather our inheritance, and more agreeable to nature. Why is it, that there is never a dispute about a market-place? Is it not because it is common to all? But about a house, and about property, men are always disputing. Things necessary are set before us in common; but even in the least things we do not observe a community. Yet those greater things He has opened freely to all, that we might thence be instructed to have these inferior things in common. Yet for all this, we are not instructed.</p>

<p>But as I said, how can he, who is rich, be a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man? When he distributes his riches, he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, so that he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> when he has ceased to have it, when he gives it to others; but while he keeps it himself, he is not good. How then is that a good which being retained renders men <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, being parted with makes them good? Not therefore to have <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, but to have it not, makes one appear to be good. Wealth therefore is not a good. But if, when you can receive it, you receive it not, again you are good.</p>

<p>If then we are good, when having it, we distribute it to others; or when offered to us we refuse it, and if we are not good, when we receive or gain it, how can it be a good thing in itself? Call it not therefore a good. You possess it not, because you think it a good, because you are anxious to possess it. Cleanse your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and rectify your judgment, and then you will be good. Learn what are really goods. What are they? Virtue and benevolence. These and not that, are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> good. According to this rule, the more charitable you are, the more good you will be considered. But if you are rich, you are no longer good. Let us therefore become thus good, that we may be really good, and may obtain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, with whom, etc.</p>
