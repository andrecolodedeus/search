<h1>Homily 12 on Hebrews</h1>

<h2>Hebrews 7:1-3</h2>

<p><q>For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, Priest of the most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who met <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> returning from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him: to whom also <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of Righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of Peace, without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, abides a Priest continually.</q></p>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wishing to show the difference between the New and Old [Covenant], scatters it everywhere; and shoots from afar, and noises it abroad,  and prepares beforehand. For at once even from the introduction, he laid down this saying, that <q>to them indeed He spoke by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but to us by the Son</q> <span class="stiki">c. i. 1, 2</span>, and to them <q>at sundry times and in various manners,</q> but to us through the Son. Afterwards, having discoursed concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who He was and what He had wrought, and given an exhortation to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him, lest we should suffer the same things as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and having said that He is <q>High Priest after the order of Melchisedec</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse20">Hebrews 6:20</a></span>, and having oftentimes wished to enter into [the subject of] this difference, and having used much preparatory management; and having rebuked them as weak, and again soothed and restored them to confidence; then at last he introduces the discussion on the difference [of the two dispensations] to ears in their full vigor. For he who is depressed in spirits would not be a ready hearer. And that you may understand this, hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> saying, <q>They hearkened not to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for anguish of spirit.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo006.htm#verse9">Exodus 6:9</a></span> Therefore having first cleared away their despondency by many considerations, some fearful, some more gentle, he then from this point enters upon the discussion of the difference [of the dispensations].</p>

<p>2. And what does he say? <q>For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, Priest of the Most High God.</q> And, what is especially noteworthy, he shows the difference to be great by the Type itself. For as I said, he continually confirms the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the Type, from things past, on account of the weakness of the hearers. <q>For</q> (he says) <q>this Melchisedec, King of Salem, Priest of the Most High <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who met <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> returning from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him, to whom also <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gave a tenth part of all.</q> Having concisely set down the whole narrative, he looked at  it <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>.</p>

<p>And first from the name. <q>First</q> (he says) <q>being by interpretation King of righteousness</q>: for Sedec means <q>righteousness</q>; and Melchi, <q>King</q>: Melchisedec, <q>King of righteousness.</q> Do you see his exactness even in the names? But who is <q>King of righteousness,</q> save <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>? <q>King of righteousness. And after that also King of Salem,</q> from his city, <q>that is, King of Peace,</q> which again is [characteristic] of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For He has made us righteous, and has <q>made peace</q> for <q>things in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and things on earth.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse20">Colossians 1:20</a></span> What man is <q>King of Righteousness and of Peace</q>? None, save only <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>3. He then adds another distinction, <q>Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, abides a Priest continually.</q> Since then there lay in his way [as an objection] the [words] <q>You are a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec,</q> whereas he [Melchisedec] was dead, and was not <q>Priest for ever,</q> see how he explained it <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a>.</p>

<p>'And who can say this concerning a man?' I do not assert this in fact (he says); the meaning is, we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> when  [or] what father he had, nor what mother, nor when he received his beginning, nor when he died. And what of this (one says)? For does it follow, because we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, that he did not die, [or] had no <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>? You say well: he both died and had <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. How then [was he] <q>without father, without mother</q>? How <q>having neither beginning of days nor end of life</q>? How? [Why] from its not being expressed.  And what of this? That as this man is so, from his genealogy not being given, so is Christ from the very nature of the reality.</p>

<p>See the <q>without beginning</q>; see the <q>without end.</q> As in case of this man, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not either <q>beginning of days,</q> or <q>end of life,</q> because they have not been written; so we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> [them] not in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, not because they have not been written, but because  they do not exist. For that indeed is a type,  and therefore [we say] 'because it is not written,' but this is the reality,  and therefore [we say] 'because it does not exist.' For as in regard to the names also (for there <q>King of Righteousness</q> and <q>of Peace</q> are appellations, but here the reality) so these too are appellations in that case, in this the reality. How then has He a beginning? You see that the Son is <q>without beginning,</q>  not in respect of His not having a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>;  (for this is impossible: for He has a Father, otherwise how is He Son?) but in respect of His <q>not having beginning or end of life.</q></p>

<p><q>But made like the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> Where is the likeness? That we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not of the one or of the other either the end or the beginning. Of the one because they are not written; of the other, because they do not exist. Here is the likeness. But if the likeness were to exist in all respects, there would no longer be type and reality; but both would be type. [Here] then just as in representations  [by painting or drawing], there is somewhat that is like and somewhat that is unlike. By means of the lines indeed there is a likeness of features,  but when the colors are put on, then the difference is plainly shown, both the likeness and the unlikeness.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 7:4</h2>

<p>4. <q>Now consider</q> (says he) <q>how great this man is to whom even the Patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gave the tenth of the spoils.</q>  Up to this point he has been applying the type: henceforward he boldly shows him [Melchisedec] to be more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than the Jewish realities. But if he who bears a type of Christ is so much better not merely than the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but even than the forefather himself of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, what should one say of the reality? You see how super-abundantly he shows the superiority.</p>

<p><q>Now consider</q> (he says) <q>how great this man is to whom even the Patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gave a tenth out of the choice portions.</q> Spoils taken in battle are called <q>choice portions.</q>  And it cannot be said that he gave them to him as having a part in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, because (he said) he met him <q>returning from the slaughter of the kings,</q> for he had staid at home (he means), yet [<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>] gave him the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of his labors.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 7:5-6</h2>

<p><q>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi who receive the office of Priesthood, have a commandment to take <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q></p>

<p>So great (he would say) is the superiority of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, that they who from their ancestors are of the same dignity, and have the same forefather, are yet far better than the rest. At all events they <q>receive <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a></q> from them. When then one is found, who receives <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> from these very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, are not they indeed in the rank of <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, and he among the Priests?</p>

<p>And not only this; but neither was he of the same dignity with them, but of another race: so that he would not have given <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> to a stranger unless his dignity had been great. Astonishing! What has he accomplished? He has made quite clear a greater point than those relating to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which he treated in the Epistle to the Romans. For there indeed he declares <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to be the forefather both of our polity and also of the Jewish. But here he is exceeding bold against him, and shows that the uncircumcised person is far superior. &nbsp;How then did he show that Levi paid <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>? <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> (he says) paid them. 'And how does this concern us?' It especially concerns you: for you will not contend that the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> are superior to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse6">Hebrews 7:6</a></span> <q>But he whose descent is not counted from them, received <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Hebrews 7:7</h2>

<p>And after that he did not simply pass on, but added, <q>and blessed him that had the promises.</q> Inasmuch as throughout, this was regarded with reverence, he shows that [Melchisedec] was to be reverenced more than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, from the common judgment of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse7">Hebrews 7:7</a></span> <q>And without all contradiction,</q> he says, <q>the less is blessed of the better,</q> i.e. in the opinion of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> it is the inferior that is blessed by the superior. So then the type of Christ is superior even to <q>him that had the promises.</q></p>

<h2>Hebrews 7:8-10</h2>

<p> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse8">Hebrews 7:8</a></span> <q>And here men that die receive <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>: but there he of whom it is testified that he lives.</q> But lest we should say, Tell us, why are you going so far back? He says, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse9">Hebrews 7:9</a></span> <q>And as I may so say</q> (and he did well in softening it) <q>Levi also who receives <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> payed <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q> How? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse10">Hebrews 7:10</a></span> <q>For he was yet in his loins when Melchisedec met him,</q> i.e. Levi was in him, although he was not yet born. And he said not the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> but Levi.</p>

<p>Have you seen the superiority? Have you seen how great is the interval between <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and Melchisedec, who bears the type of our High Priest? And he shows that the superiority had been caused by authority, not necessity. For the one paid the <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a>, which indicates the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: the other gave the blessing, which indicates the superior. This superiority passes on also to the descendants.</p>

<p>In a marvelous and triumphant way he cast out the Jewish [system]. On this account he  said, <q>You have become dull,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse12">Hebrews 5:12</a></span>, because he wished to lay these foundations, that they might not start away. Such is the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, first preparing them well, he so leads  them into what he wishes. For the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> is hard to persuade, and needs much attention, even more than plants. Since in that case there is [only] the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of material bodies, and earth, which yields to the hands of the husbandmen: but in this there is will, which is liable to many alterations, and now prefers this, now that. For it quickly turns to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>5. Wherefore we ought always to <q>guard</q> ourselves, lest at any time we should fall asleep. For <q>Lo</q> (it is said) <q>he that keeps <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall neither slumber nor sleep</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa120.htm#verse4">Psalm 121:4</a></span>, and <q>Do not suffer  your foot to be moved.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa120.htm#verse3">Psalm 121:3</a></span> He did not say, 'be not moved' but <q>do not thou suffer,</q> etc. The suffering depends then on ourselves, and not on any other. For if we will stand <q>steadfast and unmoveable</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse58">1 Corinthians 15:58</a></span>, we shall not be shaken.</p>

<p>What then? Does nothing depend on God? All indeed depends on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not so that our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is hindered. 'If then it depend on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' (one says), 'why does He blame us?' On this account I said, 'so that our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is not hindered.' It depends then on us, and on Him. For we must first choose the good; and then He leads us to His own.  He does not anticipate our choice,  lest our <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> should be outraged. But when we have chosen, then great is the assistance he brings to us.</p>

<p>How is it then that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>not of him that wills,</q> if it depend on ourselves also <q>nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans 9:16</a></span></p>

<p>In the first place, he did not introduce it as his own opinion, but inferred it from what was before him and from what had been put forward  [in the discussion]. For after saying, <q>It is written, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse15">Romans 9:15</a></span>, he says, <q>It follows then  that it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.</q> <q>You will say then unto me, why does He yet find fault?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans 9:16-19</a></span></p>

<p>And secondly the other explanation may be given, that he speaks of all as His, whose the greater part is. For it is ours to choose  and to wish; but God's to complete and to bring to an end. Since therefore the greater part is of Him, he says all is of Him, speaking according to the custom of men. &nbsp;For so we ourselves also do. I mean for instance: we see a house well built, and we say the whole is the Architect's [doing], and yet certainly it is not all his, but the workmen's also, and the owner's, who supplies the materials, and many others', but nevertheless since he contributed the greatest share, we call the whole his. So then [it is] in this case also. Again, with respect to a number of people, where the many are, we say All are: where few, nobody. So also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.</q></p>

<p>And herein he establishes two great truths: one, that we should not be lifted up:  even should you run (he would say), even should you be very earnest, do not consider that the well doing  is your own. For if you obtain not the impulse  that is from above, all is to no purpose. Nevertheless that you will attain that which thou earnestly strivest after is very evident; so long as you run, so long as you will.</p>

<p>He did not then assert this, that we run in vain, but that, if we think the whole to be our own, if we do not assign the greater part to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we run in vain. For neither has God willed that the whole should be His, lest He should appear to be crowning us without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>: nor again our's, lest we should fall away to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For if when we have the smaller [share], we think much of ourselves, what should we do if the whole depended on us?</p>

<p>6. Indeed God has done away many things for the purpose of cutting away our boastfulness, and still there is the  high hand. With how many afflictions has He encompassed us, so as to cut away our <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> spirit! With how many wild beasts has He encircled us! For indeed when some say, 'why is this?' 'Of what use is this?' They utter these things against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He has placed you in the midst of so  great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and yet not even so are you lowly-minded; but if you ever attain a little success, you reach to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> itself in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</p>

<p>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> [come] rapid changes and reverses; and yet not even so are we instructed. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> are there continual and untimely deaths, but are minded as if we were <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, as if we should never die. We plunder, we over-reach, as though we were never to give account. We build as if we were to abide here always. And not even the word of God daily sounded into our ears, nor the events themselves instruct us. Not a day, not an hour can be mentioned, in which we may not see continual funerals. But all in vain: and nothing reaches our hardness [of heart]: nor are we even able to become better by the calamities of others; or rather, we are not willing. When we ourselves only are afflicted, then we are subdued, and yet if God take off His hand, we again lift up our hand: no one considers what is proper for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,  no one despises the things on earth; no one looks to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. But as swine turn their heads downwards, stooping towards their belly, wallowing in the mire; so too the great body of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> defile themselves with the most intolerable filth, without being conscious of it.</p>

<p>7. For better were it to be defiled with unclean mud than with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for he who is defiled with the one, washes it off in a little time, and becomes like one who had never from the first fallen into that slough; but he who has fallen into the deep pit of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has contracted a defilement that is not cleansed by water, but needs long time, and strict repentance, and tears and lamentations, and more wailing, and that more fervent, than we show over the dearest friends. For this defilement attaches to us from without, wherefore we also speedily put it away; but the other is generated from within, wherefore also we wash it off with difficulty, and cleanse ourselves from it. <q>For from the heart</q> (it is said) <q>proceed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, fornications, adulteries, thefts, false witnesses.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse19">Matthew 15:19</a></span> Wherefore also the Prophet said, <q>Create in me a clean heart, O God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse10">Psalm 51:10</a></span> And another, <q>Wash your heart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, O Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer004.htm#verse14">Jeremiah 4:14</a></span> (You see that it is both our [work] and God's.) And again, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew 5:8</a></span></p>

<p>Let us become clean to the utmost of our power. Let us wipe away our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. And how to wipe them away, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> teaches, saying, <q>Wash you, make you clean, put away your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, before My eyes.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse16">Isaiah 1:16</a></span> What is <q>before My eyes</q>? Because some seem to be free from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but only to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, while to God they are manifest as being <q>whited sepulchers.</q> Therefore He says, so put them away as I see. <q>Learn to do well, seek judgment, do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> for the poor and lowly.</q> <q>Come now, and let us reason together, says the Lord: and though your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be as scarlet, I will make you white as snow, and if they be as crimson, I will make you white as wool.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse17">Isaiah 1:17-18</a></span> You see that we must first cleanse ourselves, and then God cleanses us. For having said first, <q>Wash you, make you clean,</q> He then added <q>I will make you white.</q></p>

<p>Let no one then, [even] of those who have come to the extremest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, despair of himself. For (He says) even if you have passed into the habit, yea and almost into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> itself, be not afraid. Therefore taking [the instance of] colors that are not superficial but almost of the substance of the materials, He said that He would bring them into the opposite state. For He did not simply say that He would <q>wash</q> us, but that He would <q>make</q> us <q>white, as snow and as wool,</q> in order to hold out good hopes before us. Great then is the power of repentance, at least if it makes us as snow, and whitens us as wool, even if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> have first got possession and dyed our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p>Let us labor earnestly then to become clean; He has enjoined nothing burdensome. <q>Judge the fatherless, and do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse17">Isaiah 1:17</a></span> You see everywhere how great account God makes of mercy, and of standing forward in behalf of those that are wronged. These good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> let us pursue after, and we shall be able also, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to attain to the blessings to come: which may we all be counted worthy of, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, with whom to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, power, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and for ever and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
