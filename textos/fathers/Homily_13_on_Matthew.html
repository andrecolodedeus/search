<h1>Homily 13 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse1">Matt. IV. 1</a>.</strong></p>

<p><q>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q></p>

<p>Then. When? After the descent of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, after the voice that was borne from above, and said, <q>This is My Beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</q> And what was marvellous, it was of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; for this, he here says, led Him up. For since with a view to our instruction He both did and underwent all things; He endures also to be led up there, and to wrestle against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: in order that each of those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, if after his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> he have to endure greater <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> may not be troubled as if the result were unexpected, but may continue to endure all nobly, as though it were happening in the natural course of things.</p>

<p>Yea, for therefore you took up arms, not to be idle, but to fight. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> neither does God hinder the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> as they come on, first to teach you that you have become much stronger; next, that you may continue modest neither be exalted even by the greatness of your gifts, the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> having power to repress you; moreover, in order that that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, who is for a while doubtful about your desertion of him, by the touchstone of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> may be well assured that you have utterly forsaken and fallen from him; fourthly, that you may in this way be made stronger, and better tempered than any steel; fifthly, that you may obtain a clear demonstration of the treasures entrusted to you.</p>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> would not have assailed you, unless he had seen you brought to greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Hence, for example, from the beginning, he attacked Adam, because he saw him in the enjoyment of great dignity. For this reason he arrayed himself against Job, because he saw him crowned and proclaimed by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all.</p>

<p>How then says He, <q>Pray that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200530"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a></span> For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> he does not show you Jesus simply going up, but <q>led up</q> according to the principle of the Economy; signifying obscurely by this, that we ought not of ourselves to leap upon it, but being dragged thereto, to stand manfully.</p>

<p>And see whither the Spirit led Him up, when He had taken Him; not into a city and forum, but into a wilderness. That is, He being minded to attract the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, gives him a handle not only by His hunger, but also by the place. For then most especially does the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> assail, when he sees men left alone, and by themselves. Thus did he also set upon the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the beginning, having caught her alone, and found her apart from her husband. Just as when he sees us with others and banded together, he is not equally confident, and makes no attack. Wherefore we have the greatest need on this very account to be flocking together continually, that we may not be open to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> attacks.</p>

<p>2. Having then found Him in the wilderness, and in a pathless wilderness (for that the wilderness was such, Mark has declared, saying, that He <q>was with the wild beasts</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200532"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse13">Mark&nbsp;1:13</a></span>), behold with how much craft he draws near, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; and for what sort of opportunity he watches. For not in his fast, but in his hunger he approaches Him; to instruct you how great a good <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is, and how it is a most powerful shield against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and that after the font, men should give themselves up, not to luxury and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and a full table, but to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. For, for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> even He fasted, not as needing it Himself, but to instruct us. Thus, since our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> before the font were brought in by serving the belly: much as if any one who had made a sick man whole were to forbid his doing those things, from which the distemper arose; so we see here likewise that He Himself after the font brought in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. For indeed both <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> by the incontinence of the belly was cast out of paradise; and the flood in <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> time, this produced; and this brought down the thunders on <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. For although there was also a charge of whoredom, nevertheless from this grew the root of each of those punishments; which Ezekiel also signified when he said, <q>But this was the iniquity of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, that she waxed wanton in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and in fullness of bread, and in abundance of luxury.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200535"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse49">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:49</a></span> Thus the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also per  petrated the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, being driven upon transgression by their <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and delicacy. <span class="stiki" id="note200536"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;5:11-12</a></span> </p>

<p>On this account then even He too <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> forty days, pointing out to us the medicines of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; yet proceeds no further, lest on the other hand, through the exceeding greatness of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of His Economy should be discredited. For as it is, this cannot be, seeing that both <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Elias, anticipating Him, could advance to so great a length of time, strengthened by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And if He had proceeded farther, from this among other things His assumption of our flesh would have seemed incredible to many.</p>

<p>Having then fasted forty days and as many nights,</p>

<p><q>He was afterwards an hungered; <span class="stiki" id="note200538"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;4:2</a></span> </q> affording him a point to lay hold of and approach, that by actual conflict He might show how to prevail and be victorious. Just so do wrestlers also: when teaching their pupils how to prevail and overcome, they voluntarily in the lists engage with others, to afford these in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of their antagonists the means of seeing and learning the mode of conquest. Which same thing then also took place. For it being His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to draw him on so far, He both made His hunger <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him, and awaited his approach, and as He waited for him, so He dashed him to earth, once, twice, and three times, with such ease as became Him.</p>

<p>3. But that we may not, by hurrying over these victories, mar your profit, let us begin from the first assault, and examine each with exact care.</p>

<p>Thus, after He was an hungered, it is said, <q>The tempter came, and said unto Him, If Thou be <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, command that these stones be made bread.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200539"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;4:3</a></span> </p>

<p>For, because he had heard a voice borne from above, and saying, <q>This is My beloved Son;</q> and had heard also John bearing so large <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> concerning Him, and after that saw Him an hungered; he was thenceforth in perplexity, and neither could <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He was a mere man, because of the things spoken concerning Him; nor on the other hand receive it that He was <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, seeing Him as he did in hunger. Whence being m perplexity he utters ambiguous sounds. And much as when coming to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> at the beginning, he feigns things that are not, that he may learn the things that are; even so here also, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> clearly the unutterable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Economy, and who He may be that has come, he attempts to weave other nets, whereby he thought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which was hidden and obscure. And what says he? <q>If Thou be <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, command that these stones be made bread.</q> He said not, because you are an hungered, but, <q>if Thou be <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</q> thinking to cheat Him with his compliments. Wherefore also he was silent touching the hunger, that he might not seem to be alleging it, and upbraiding Him. For not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the greatness of the Economy which was going on, he supposed this to be a reproach to Him. Wherefore flattering Him craftily, he makes mention of His dignity only.</p>

<p>What then says Christ? To put down his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and to signify that there was nothing shameful in what had happened, nor unbecoming His wisdom; that which the other had passed over in silence to flatter Him, He brings forward and sets it forth, saying, <q>Man shall not live by bread alone.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200540"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;4:4</a></span> </p>

<p>So that He begins with the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the belly. But mark, I pray you, the craft of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, and whence he begins his wrestlings, and how he does not forget his proper art. For by what means he cast out also the first man, and encompassed him with thousands of other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, with the same means here likewise he weaves his deceit; I mean, with incontinence of the belly. So too even now one may hear many foolish ones say their bad words by thousands because of the belly. But Christ, to show that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> man is not compelled even by this tyranny to do anything that is unseemly, first hungers, then submits not to what is enjoined Him; teaching us to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in nothing. Thus, because the first man did hereby both offend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and transgress the law, as much and more does He teach you:&mdash; though it be no transgression which he commands, not even so to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</p>

<p>And why say I, <q>transgression</q>? <q>Why, even though something expedient be suggested by the devils, do not thou,</q> says He, <q>even so give heed unto them.</q> Thus, for instance, He stopped the mouths of those devils also, proclaiming Him <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> too again <span class="stiki" id="note200543"><a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse18">Acts&nbsp;16:18</a></span> rebuked them, crying this self-same thing; and yet what they said was profitable; but he more abundantly dishonoring them, and obstructing their plot against us, drove them away even when doctrines of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> were preached by them,  closing up their mouths, and bidding them be silent.</p>

<p>And therefore neither in this instance did He consent to what was said. But what says He? <q>Man shall not live by bread alone.</q> Now His meaning is like this: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able even by a word to nourish the hungry man;</q> bringing him a testimony out of the ancient Scripture, and teaching us, though we hunger, yea, whatever we suffer, never to fall away from our Lord.</p>

<p>But if a man say, <q>still He should have displayed Himself;</q> I would ask him, with what intent, and for what reason? For not at all that he might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> did the other so speak, but that he might, as he thought, over-argue  Him into unbelief. Since the first of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> were in this way beguiled and over-argued by him, not putting earnest <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the contrary of what God had said he promised them, and puffed them up with vain hopes, and brought them to unbelief, and so cast them out of the blessings they actually possessed. But Christ signifies Himself not to have consented, either to him then or afterwards to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> his partisans, in their demand of signs: invariably instructing us, whatever we may have power to do, yet to do nothing vainly and at random; nor even when want urges to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>4. What then does this accursed one? Overcome, and unable to persuade Him to do his bidding, and that when pressed by such violent hunger, he proceeds to another thing, saying,</p>

<p><q>If Thou be <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, cast Yourself down; for it is written, He shall give His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge concerning You, and in their hands they shall bear You up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200545"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;4:6</a></span> </p>

<p>What can the reason be, that at each <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> He adds this, <q>If Thou be <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</q> Much the same as he did in that former case, he does also at this time. That is, as he then <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, <q>In the day you eat, your eyes shall be opened;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200546"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;3:5</a></span> thereby intending to signify, that they were beguiled and overreached, and had received no benefit; even so in this case also he insinuates this same thing, saying, <q>in vain God has called You Son, and has beguiled You by His gift; for, if this be not so, afford us some clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that You are of that power.</q> Then, because Christ had reasoned with him from Scripture, he also brings in a testimony of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</p>

<p>How then does Christ? He is not indignant, nor provoked, but with that extreme gentleness He reasons with him again from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, saying, <q>You shall not tempt the Lord your God:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200547"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;4:7</a></span> teaching us that we must overcome the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but by forbearance and long-suffering, and that we should do nothing at all for display and vainglory.</p>

<p>But mark his folly, even by the very testimony which he produced. For while the testimonies cited by the Lord were both of them spoken with exceeding fitness: his, on the other hand, were chance and random sayings, neither did he bring forward on his part that which applied to the matter in hand. For that it is written, <q>He shall give His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge concerning You,</q> this surely is not advice to dash and toss one's self down headlong; and moreover, this was not so much as spoken concerning the Lord. However, this for the time He did not expose, although there was both insult in his manner of speech, and great inconsistency. For of God's Son no man requires these things: but to cast one's self down is the part of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Whereas God's part is to raise up even them that are down. And if He ought to have displayed His own power, it would not have been by casting and tossing Himself down at random, but by saving others. But to cast ourselves down precipices, and into pits, pertains properly to his troop. Thus, for example, the juggler among them does everywhere.</p>

<p>But Christ, even when these things are said, does not yet reveal Himself, but as man for a while discourses with him. For the sayings, <q>Man shall not live by bread alone;</q> and, <q>You shall not tempt the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> suited one not greatly revealing Himself, but representing Himself as one of the many.</p>

<p>But marvel not, if he in reasoning with Christ oftentimes turn himself about. For as pugilists, when they have received deadly blows, reel about, drenched in much blood, and blinded; even so he too, darkened by the first and the second blow, speaks at random what comes uppermost: and proceeds to his third assault.</p>

<p>5. <q>And he leads Him up into a high mountain, and shows Him all the kingdoms, and says, All these things will I give You, if You will fall down and worship me. Then says He, Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200548"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;4:8-10</a></span> </p>

<p>For since he was now come to sinning against the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying, that all that is the Father's was his, and was endeavoring to  make himself out to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as artificer of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; He then rebuked him: but not even then with vehemence, but simply, <q>Get you hence, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>;</q> which itself had in it something of command rather than of rebuke. For as soon as He had said to him, <q>Get you hence,</q> He caused him to take to flight; since he brought not against Him any other <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>.</p>

<p>And how says Luke, that <q>he ended all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q>  To me it seems that in mentioning the chief of the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, he had spoken of all, as though the rest too were included in these. For the things that form the substance of innumerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are these: to be a slave to the belly, to do anything for vainglory, to be in subjection to the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of riches. Which accordingly that accursed one considering, set last the most powerful of all, I mean the desire of more: and though originally, and from the beginning, he was travailing to come to this, yet he kept it for the last, as being of more force than the rest. For in fact this is the manner of his wrestling, to apply those things last, which seem more likely to overthrow. And this sort of thing he did with respect to Job likewise. Wherefore in this instance too, having begun with the motives which seem to be viler and weaker, he goes on to the more prevailing.</p>

<p>How then are we to get the better of him? In the way which Christ that taught us, by fleeing to God for refuge; and neither to be depressed in famine, as believing in God who is able to feed even with a word; nor amidst whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things we may receive to tempt Him who gave them, but to be content with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is from above, making no account of that which is of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and on every occasion to despise what is beyond our need. For nothing does so make us fall under the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as longing for more, and loving <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. And this we may see even by what is done now. For now also there are those who say, <q>All these things will we give you, if you will fall down and worship;</q> who are indeed men by nature, but have become his instruments. Since at that time too he approached Him, not by himself only, but also by others. Which Luke also was declaring, when he said, that <q>he departed from Him for a season;</q> showing that hereafter he approached Him by his proper instruments.</p>

<p><q>And, behold, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came and ministered unto Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200551"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;4:11</a></span> For when the assault was going on, He suffered them not to appear, that He might not thereby drive away the prey; but after He had convicted him in all points, and caused him to take to flight, then they appear: that you also may learn, that after your victories which are copied from His, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will receive you also, applauding you, and waiting as guards on you in all things. Thus, for example, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> take Lazarus <span class="stiki" id="note200552"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;16:22</a></span> away with them, after the furnace of poverty and of famine and of all distress. For as I have already said, Christ on this occasion exhibits many things, which we ourselves are to enjoy.</p>

<p>6. Forasmuch then as all these things have been done for you, emulate and imitate His victory. And should any one approach you of those who are that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit's servants, and savor the things that be of him, upbraiding you and saying, <q>If you are marvellous and great, remove the mountain;</q> be not troubled, nor confounded, but answer with meekness, and say some such thing as you have heard your Lord say: <q>You shall not tempt the Lord your God.</q></p>

<p>Or should he, offering <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion, and an endless amount of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, enjoin you to worship him, stand again manfully. For neither did the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> deal so with the common Lord of us all only, but every day also he brings these his machinations to bear on each of His servants, not in mountains only and in wildernesses, nor by himself: but in cities likewise, in market-places, and in courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and by means of our own kindred, even men. What then must we do? Disbelieve him altogether, and stop our ears against him, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> him when he flatters, and when he proffers more, then so much the more shun him. Because in Eve's case also, when he was most lifting her up with hopes, then he cast her down, and did her the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Yea, for he is an implacable enemy, and has taken up against us such <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> as excludes all treaty. And we are not so earnest for our own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, as he is for our ruin. Let us then shun him, not with words only, but also with works; not in mind only, but also in deed; and let us do none of the things which he approves, for so shall we do all those which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> approves. Yea, for he makes also many promises, not that he may give, but that he may take. He promises by rapine, that he may deprive us of the kingdom, and of righteousness; and sets treasures in the earth as a kind of gins or  traps, that he may deprive us both of these and of the treasures in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and he would have us be rich here, that we may not be rich there.</p>

<p>And if he should not be able by <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> to cast us out of our portion there, he comes another way, the way of poverty; as he did with respect to Job. That is, when he saw that <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> did him no harm, he weaves his toils by poverty, expecting on that side to get the better of him. But what could be more foolish than this? Since he that has been able to bear <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> with moderation, much more will he bear poverty with manliness; and he who desires not riches when present, neither will he seek them when absent; even as that blessed man did not, but by his poverty, on the other hand, he became still more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. For of his possessions that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> had power indeed to deprive him, but his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward God he not only could not take away, but made it even stronger, and when he had stripped him of all, he caused him to abound with more blessings; wherefore also he was in perplexity. For the more plagues he brought upon him, the more mighty he then saw him become. And therefore, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, when he had gone through all, and had thoroughly tried his metal, because he made no way, he ran to his old weapon, the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and assumes a mask of concern, and makes a tragical picture of his calamities in most pitiable tone, and feigns that for removal of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he is introducing that deadly counsel.  But neither so did he prevail; nay, for his bait was perceived by that wondrous man, who with much wisdom stopped the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> speaking at his instigation.</p>

<p>Just so we likewise must act: though it be a brother, a tried friend, a wife, whom you will of those nearest to us, whom he has entered into, and so utters something not convenient, we must not receive the counsel for the person of him who so speaks, but for the deadly counsel turn away from the speaker. Since in fact now also he does many such things, and puts before him a mask of sympathy, and while he seems to be friendly, he is instilling his pernicious words, more grievous than poisons. Thus, as to flatter for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is his part, so to chastise for our good, is God's.</p>

<p>7. Let us not then be deceived, neither let us by every mean seek after the life of ease. For <q>whom the Lord loves,</q> it is said, <q>He chastens.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200556"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6</a></span> Wherefore when we enjoy prosperity, living in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, then most of all should we grieve. For we ought ever to be afraid while we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but especially when we suffer no ill. For when God exacts our penalties little by little, he makes our payment for these things easy to us; but when he is long-suffering for each of our negligences, He is storing us up, if we continue in such things, unto a great punishment. Since, if for the well-doers affliction be a necessary thing, much more for them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>See for instance how much long-suffering <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> met with, and afterwards underwent for all most extreme punishment: in how many things <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> offended, yet at the end expiated all; and the rich man, because he had suffered no great ill here, for this very <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> chiefly became miserable, for that having lived in luxury in the present life, he departed to pay the penalty of all these things there, where he could not obtain anything at all to soothe his calamity.</p>

<p>Yet for all this some are so cold and senseless, as to be always seeking only the things that are here, and uttering those absurd sayings, <q>Let me enjoy all things present for a time, and then I will consider about things out of sight: I will gratify my belly, I will be a slave to pleasures, I will make full use of the present life; give me today, and take tomorrow.</q> Oh excess of folly! Why, wherein do they who talk so differ from goats and swine? For if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <span class="stiki" id="note200557"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse8">Jeremiah&nbsp;5:8</a></span> permits not them to be accounted men, that <q>neigh after their neighbors wife,</q> who shall blame us for esteeming these to be goats and swine, and more insensible than asses, by whom those things are held uncertain, which are more evident than what we see? Why, if you believe nothing else, attend to the devils in their scourging, to them who had our hurt for their object in all their practice, both in word and deed. For you will not, I am sure, contradict this, that they do all to increase our security, and to do away with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and to breed disbelief of the tribunals in that world. Nevertheless, they that are so minded, by cryings and wailings do oftentimes proclaim the torments that are there.  Whence is it then that they so speak, and utter things contrary to their own will? From no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but because they are under the pressure of stronger compulsion. For they would have not been minded of their own accord to confess either that they  are tormented by dead men, or that they at all suffer anything dreadful.</p>

<p>Wherefore now have I said this? Because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> confess <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, who would fain have <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> disbelieved; but you who enjoyest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> so great, and hast been a partaker in unutterable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, dost not so much as imitate them, but art become more hardened even than they.</p>

<p>8. <q>But who,</q> one will say, <q>has come from those in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and has declared these things?</q> Why, who has arrived here from heaven, and told us that there is a God who created all things? And whence is it clear that we have a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? For plainly, if you are to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the things only that are in sight, both God and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and mind and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, will be matter of doubting to you, and in this way you will find all the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> gone.</p>

<p>Yet surely, if you are willing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is evident, the things invisible ought to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by you, rather than those which are seen. Even though what I say be a paradox, nevertheless it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of understanding is fully acknowledged. For whereas the eyes are often deceived, not in the things unseen only (for of those they do not so much as take cognizance), but even in those which men think they actually see, distance and atmosphere, and absence of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and care, and ten thousand other things impeding their accuracy; the reasoning power of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> on the other hand, if it receive the light of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, will prove a more accurate, an unerring standard of realities.</p>

<p>Let us not then vainly deceive ourselves, neither in addition to the carelessness of our life, which is the offspring of such doctrines as these, heap up to ourselves, for the very doctrines themselves, a more grievous fire. For if there be no judgment, and we are not to give account of our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, neither shall we receive rewards for our labors. Observe which way your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> tend, when you say, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is righteous, and loving, and mild, overlooks so great labors and toils. And how can this be reasonable? Why, if by nothing else, at any rate by the circumstances of your own house, I bid you weigh these things, and then you will see the absurdity. For though you were yourself savage and inhuman beyond measure, and wilder than the very wild beasts, you would not choose at your death to leave unhonored the servant that had been affectionate to you, but requitest him both with freedom, and with a gift of money; and forasmuch as in your own person hereafter, having departed, you will be able to do him no good, you give charge concerning him to the future inheritors of your substance, beseeching, exhorting, doing everything, so that he may not remain unrewarded.</p>

<p>So then you, who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, are so kind and loving towards your servant; and will the Infinite Goodness, that is, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Unspeakable Love to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the kindness so vast: will He overlook and leave uncrowned His own servants, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and James, and John, those who every day for His sake suffered hunger, were bound, were scourged, were drowned in the sea, were given up to wild beasts, were dying, were suffering so great things as we cannot so much as reckon up? And whereas the Olympic judge proclaims and crowns the victor, and the master rewards the servant, and the king the soldier, and each in general him that has done him service, with what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things he can; shall God alone, after those so great toils and labors, repay them with no good thing great or small? Shall those just and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men, who have walked in every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, lie in the same state with adulterers, and parricides, and manslayers, and violators of tombs? And in what way can this be reasonable? Since, if there be nothing after our departure hence, and our interests reach no further than things present, those are in the same case with these, or rather not so much as in the same. For what though hereafter, as you say, they fare alike? Yet here, the whole of their time, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> have been at ease, the righteous in chastisement. And this what sort of tyrant, what savage and relentless man did ever so devise, touching his own servants and subjects?</p>

<p>Did you mark the exceeding greatness of the absurdity, and in what this argument issues? Therefore if you will not any other way, yet by these reasonings be instructed to rid yourself of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thought, and to flee from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and cleave to the toils which end in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: and then shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certainly that our concerns are not bounded by the present life. And if any one ask you, <q>Who has come from thence and brought word what is there?</q> say unto him, of men not one; for surely he would have been often disbelieved, as vaunting, and exaggerating the thing; but the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> has brought word with exactness of all those things. What need then have we of any man, seeing He, that will demand account of us, cries aloud every day, that He has both made ready a <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and prepared a kingdom; and affords us clear demonstrations of these things? For if He were not hereafter to  judge, neither would he have exacted any penalty here.</p>

<p>9. <q>Well, but as to this very point how can it be reasonable? That of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> some should be punished, others not? I mean, if God be no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as surely He is not, why can it be that of one He exacts a penalty, but another He suffers to go away unpunished? Why, this is again more inexplicable than the former.</q></p>

<p>Yet if you are willing to hear what we say with candor, we will solve this difficulty also.</p>

<p>What then is the solution? He neither exacts penalty of all here, lest you should despair of the resurrection, and lose all expectation of the judgment, as though all were to give account here; nor does He suffer all to go away unpunished, lest on the other hand you should account all to be without His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>; but He both punishes and abstains from punishing: by those whom He punishes, signifying that in that world also He will exact a penalty of such as are unpunished here; and by those whom He does not punish, working upon you to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is some fearful trial after our departure hence.</p>

<p>But if He were altogether indifferent about our former <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, He neither would have punished any here, nor have conferred benefits. But now you see Him for your sake stretching out the heaven, kindling the sun, founding the earth, pouring forth the sea, expanding the air, and appointing for the moon her courses, setting unchangeable <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the seasons of the years, and all other things too performing their own courses exactly at a sign from Him. For both our nature, and that of creatures irrational, of them that creep, that walk, that fly, that swim, in marshes, in springs, in rivers, in mountains, in forests, in houses, in the air, in plains; plants also, and seeds, and trees, both wild and cultivated, both fruitful and unfruitful; and all things in general, moved by that unwearied Hand, make provision for our life, affording to us of themselves their ministry, not for our need only, but also for our feeling of high station.  </p>

<p>Seeing therefore order so great and fair (and yet we have not mentioned so much as the least portion thereof), do you dare say, that He who for your sake has wrought things so many and great will overlook you in the most critical points, and suffer you when dead to lie with the asses and swine: and that having <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> you with so great a gift, that of godliness, whereby He has even equaled you with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, He will overlook you after your countless labors and toils?</p>

<p>And how can this be reasonable? Why, these things, if we be silent <q>the stones will immediately cry out;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note200560"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;19:40</a></span> so plain are they, and manifest, and more lucid than the sunbeam itself.</p>

<p>Having then considered all these things, and having convinced our own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that after our departure hence, we shall both stand at the fearful judgment-seat, and give account of all that we have done, and shall bear our penalty, and submit to our sentence, if we continue in our negligences; and shall receive crowns and unutterable blessings, if we are willing to give a little heed to ourselves; let us both stop the mouths of them who gainsay these things, and ourselves choose the way of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; that with due confidence departing to that tribunal, we may attain unto the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that are promised us, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion, now and ever, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
