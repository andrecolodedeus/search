<h1>Homily 13 on Philippians</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse18">Philippians 3:18-21</a></span> </p>

<p><q>For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>: whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is in their shame, who mind earthly things. For our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we wait for a Saviour, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>: who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, according to the working whereby He is able even to subject all things unto Himself.</q></p>

<p>Nothing is so incongruous in a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and foreign to his character, as to seek ease and rest; and to be engrossed with the present life is foreign to our profession and enlistment. Your Master was crucified, and do you seek ease? Your Master was pierced with nails, and do you live delicately? Do these things become a noble soldier? Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>Many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Since there were some who made a pretense of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, yet lived in ease and luxury, and this is contrary to the Cross: therefore he thus spoke. For the cross belongs to a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at its post for the fight, longing to die, seeking nothing like ease, while their conduct is of the contrary sort. So that even if they say, they are Christ's, still they are as it were enemies of the Cross. For did they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Cross, they would strive to live the crucified life. Was not your Master hung upon the tree? Do thou otherwise imitate Him. Crucify yourself, though no one crucify you. Crucify yourself, not that you may slay yourself, God forbid, for that is a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thing, but as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, <q>The world has been crucified unto me and I unto the world.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians 6:14</a></span> If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your Master, die His death. Learn how great is the power of the Cross; how many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things it has achieved, and does still: how it is the safety of our life. Through it all things are done. Baptism is through the Cross, for we must receive that seal. The <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> is through the Cross. If we are on journeys, if we are at home, wherever we are, the Cross is a great good, the armor of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, a shield which cannot be beaten down, a weapon to oppose the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; you bear the Cross when you are at enmity with him, not simply when you seal yourself by it, but when you suffer the things belonging to the Cross. Christ thought fit to call our sufferings by the name of the Cross. As when he says, <q>Except a man take up his cross and follow Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse24">Matthew 16:24</a></span>, i.e. except he be prepared to die.</p>

<p>But these being base, and lovers of life, and lovers of their bodies, are enemies of the Cross. And every one, who is a friend of luxury, and of present safety, is an enemy of that Cross in which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> makes his boast: which he embraces, with which he desires to be incorporated. As when he says, <q>I am crucified unto the world, and the world unto me.</q> But here he says, <q>I now tell you weeping.</q> Wherefore? Because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was urgent, because such deserve tears. Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the luxurious are worthy of tears, who make fat that which is thrown about them, I mean the body, and take no thought of that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which must give account. Behold you live delicately, behold you are drunken, today and tomorrow, ten years, twenty, thirty, fifty, a hundred, which is impossible; but if you will, let us suppose it. What is the end? What is the gain? Nought at all. Does it not then deserve tears, and lamentations, to lead such a life; God has brought us into this course, that He may crown us, and we take our departure without doing any noble action. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> weeps, where others laugh, and live in pleasure. So sympathetic is he: such thought takes he for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <q>Whose god,</q> says he, <q>is the belly.</q> For this have they a God!  That is, <q>let us eat and drink!</q> Do you see, how great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> luxury is? To some their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and to others their belly is a god. Are not these too idolaters, and worse than the common? And their <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is in their shame.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse32">1 Corinthians 15:32</a></span> Some say it is <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. I think not so, but this is its meaning, they make a boast of those things, of which they ought to be ashamed. It is a fearful thing to do shameful actions; yet to do them, and be ashamed, is only half so dreadful. But where a man even boasts himself of them, it is excessive senselessness.</p>

<p>Do these words apply to them alone? And do those who are here present escape the charge? And will no one have account to render of these things? Does no one make a god of his belly, or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his shame? I wish, earnestly I wish, that none of these charges lay against us, and that I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any one involved in what I have said. But I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the words have more reference to us than to the men of those times. For when one consumes his whole life in drinking and reveling, and expends some small trifle on the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, while he consumes the larger portion on his belly, will not these words with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> apply to him? No words are more apt to call attention, or more cutting in reproof, than these: <q>Whose god is the belly, whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is in their shame.</q> And who are these? They, he says, who mind earthly things. <q>Let us build houses.</q> Where, I ask? On the earth, they answer. Let us purchase farms; on the earth again: let us obtain power; again on the earth: let us gain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; again on the earth: let us enrich ourselves; all these things are on the earth. These are they, whose god is their belly; for if they have no spiritual thoughts, but have all their possessions here, and mind these things, with reason have they their belly for their god, in saying, <q>Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</q> And about your body, you grieve, tell me, that it is of earth, though thus you are not at all injured. But your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> you drag down to the earth, when you ought to render even your body spiritual; for you may, if you will. You have received a belly, that you may feed, not distend it, that you may have the mastery over it, not have it as mistress over you: that it may minister to you for the nourishment of the other parts, not that you may minister to it, not that you may exceed limits. The sea, when it passes its bounds, does not work so many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, as the belly does to our body, together with our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The former overflows all the earth, the latter all the body. Put moderation for a boundary to it, as God has put the sand for the sea. Then if its waves arise, and rage furiously, rebuke it, with the power which is in you. See how God has <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> you, that you might imitate Him, and you will not; but you see the belly overflowing, destroying and overwhelming your whole nature, and darest not to restrain or moderate it.</p>

<p><q>Whose <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he says, <q>is their belly.</q> Let us see how <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> served God: let us see how <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttons</a> serve their belly. Do not they undergo ten thousand such deaths? Do not they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to disobey whatever it orders? Do not they minister impossibilities to it? Are not they worse than slaves? <q>But our citizenship,</q> says he, <q>is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> Let us not then seek for ease here; there do we shine, where also our citizenship is. <q>From whence also,</q> says he, <q>we wait for a Saviour,</q> the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>: <q>who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> By little and little he has carried us up. He says, <q>From <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></q> and <q>Our Saviour,</q> showing, from the place and from the Person, the dignity of the subject. <q>Who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation,</q> says he. The body now suffers many things: it is bound with chains, it is scourged, it suffers innumerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; but the body of Christ suffered the same. This, then, he hinted at when he said, <q>That it may be conformed to the body of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> Wherefore the body is the same, but puts on incorruption. <q>Shall fashion anew.</q> Wherefore the fashion is different; or perchance he has spoken figuratively of the change.</p>

<p>He says, <q>the body of our humiliation,</q> because it is now humbled, subject to destruction, to pain, because it seems to be worthless, and to have nothing beyond that of other animals. <q>That it may be conformed to the body of his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> What? Shall this our body be fashioned like Him, who sits at the right hand of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, to Him who is worshipped by the Angels, before whom do stand the incorporeal Powers, to Him who is above all rule and power, and might? If then the whole world were to take up weeping and lament for those who have fallen from this hope, could it worthily lament? Because, when a promise is given us of our body being made like to Him, it still departs with the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. I care not for <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> henceforth; whatever can be said, having fallen from so great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, now and henceforth consider <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> to be nothing to this falling away. What do you say, O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? To be made like Him? Yes, he answers; then, lest you should disbelieve, he adds a reason; <q>According to the working whereby He is able even to subject all things unto Himself.</q> He has power, says he, to subject all things unto Himself, wherefore also destruction and death. Or rather, He does this also with the same power. For tell me, which requires the greater power, to subject <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and Angels, and Archangels, and Cherubim, and Seraphim, or to make the body incorruptible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>? The latter certainly much more than the former; he showed forth the greater works of His power, that you might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these too. Wherefore, though ye see these men rejoicing, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, yet stand firm, be not offended at them, be not moved. These our hopes are sufficient to raise up even the most sluggish and indolent.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse1">Chap. iv. ver. 1</a>. <q>Wherefore,</q> says he, <q>my brethren, beloved and longed for, my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and crown, so stand fast in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, my beloved.</q></p>

<p><q>So.</q> How? Unmoved. See how he adds praise after exhortation, <q>my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and my crown,</q> not simply <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> but <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> too, not simply <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> but my crown too. Which <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> nought can equal, since it is the crown of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. <q>So stand fast in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, my beloved,</q> i.e. in the hope of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ver. 2, 3. <q>I exhort Euodia, and exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord. Yea, I beseech you also, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> yokefellow, help these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</q></p>

<p>Some say <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> here exhorts his own wife; but it is not so, but some other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, or the husband of one of them. <q>Help these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, for they labored with me in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers whose names are in the book of life.</q> Do you see how great a testimony he bears to their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>? For as Christ says to his Apostles, <q>Rejoice not that the spirits are subject to you, but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that your names are written in the book of life</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse20">Luke 10:20</a></span>; so <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> testifies to them, saying, <q>whose names are in the book of life.</q> These <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> seem to me to be the chief of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which was there, and he commends them to some notable man whom he calls his <q>yokefellow,</q> to whom perchance he was wont to commend them, as to a fellow-worker, and fellow-soldier, and brother, and companion, as he does in the Epistle to the Romans, when he says, <q>I commend unto you Phebe our sister, who is a servant of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that is at Cenchrea.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse1">Romans 16:1</a></span> <q>Yokefellow;</q> either some brother of theirs, or a husband of hers; as if he had said, Now you are a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> brother, now a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> husband, because you have become a Member. <q>For they labored with me in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> This protection  came from home, not from friendship, but for good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. <q>Labored with me.</q> What do you say? Did <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> labor with you? Yes, he answers, they too contributed no small portion. Although many were they who wrought together with him, yet these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also acted with him among the many. The Churches then were no little edified, for many good ends are gained where they who are approved, be they men, or be they <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, enjoy from the rest such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. For in the first place the rest were led on to a like <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; in the second place, they also gained  by the respect shown; and thirdly, they made those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and earnest. Wherefore you see that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has everywhere a care for this, and commends such men for consideration. As he says in the Epistle to the Corinthians: <q>Who are the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of Achaia,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse15">1 Corinthians 16:15</a></span> Some say that the word <q>yokefellow,</q> (Syzygus,) is a proper name. Well, what? Whether it be so, or no, we need not accurately enquire,  but observe that he gives his orders, that these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> should enjoy much protection.</p>

<p>All we have, says he, is in the heavens, our Saviour, our city, whatever a man can name: <q>whence,</q> says he, <q>we wait for a Saviour, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> And this is an act of His kindness and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward man. He Himself again comes to us, he does not drag us there, but takes us, and so departs with us. And this is a mark of great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; for if He came to us when we were enemies, much rather does He now when we have become friends. He does not commit this to the Angels, nor to servants, but Himself comes to call us to His royal mansion.  See, we also <q>shall be caught up in the clouds</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a></span>, doing him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.</p>

<p>Who then is to be found <q>the faithful and wise servant</q>? Who are they that are deemed worthy of such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? How miserable are those who fail! For if we were forever to weep, should we do anything worthy of the occasion? For were you to make mention of hells innumerable, you would name nothing equal to that pain which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sustains, when all the world is in confusion, when the trumpets are sounding, when the Angels are rushing forward, the first, then the second, then the third, then ten thousand ranks, are pouring forth upon the earth; then the Cherubim, (and many are these and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>;) the Seraphim; when He Himself is coming, with His ineffable <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; when those meet Him, who had gone to gather the elect into the midst; when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and his companions, and all who in his time had been approved, are crowned, are proclaimed aloud, are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by the King, before all His heavenly host. For if <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> did not exist, how fearful a thing it is, that the one part should be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, and the other dishonored! Hell, I confess, is intolerable, yea, very intolerable, but more intolerable than it is the loss of the Kingdom. Consider; if any king, or the son of a king, having taken his departure, and been successful in innumerable <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and become the object of admiration, should with his army entire, return to any city, in his chariot, with his trophies, with his innumerable ranks of golden shields, with his spearmen, his bodyguard all about him, while the whole city was adorned with crowns, while all the rulers of the world accompanied him, and all the soldiery of foreign nations followed him as captives, then pr&aelig;fects, satraps, and in the presence of all the rulers, and all that splendor, he should receive the citizens who meet him, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> them, and stretch forth his hand, and give them freedom of access, and converse with them, all standing around, as with friends, and tell them that all that journey was undertaken for their sake, and should lead them into his palace, and give them a share of it, even if the rest should not be punished, to how great punishment would not this be equal? But if in the case of men it were a bitter thing to fall away from this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, much more is it so with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when all the heavenly Powers are present with the King, when the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, bound, and bowing down their heads, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself is led along in chains, and all military force that opposes itself, when the Powers of the heavens, when He Himself, comes upon the clouds.</p>

<p>Believe me, I am not even able to finish my words, from the grief which lays hold of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at this relation. Consider of how great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> we shall be deprived, when it is in our power not to be deprived of it. For this is the misery, that we suffer these things, when it is in our power not to suffer them. When he receives the one part and leads them to His Father in heaven, and rejects the other, whom Angels take and drag against their will, weeping, and hanging down their heads, to the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, when they have first been made a spectacle to the whole world, what grief, think you, is there? Let us then make haste, while there is time, and take great thought of our own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. How many things have we to say like the rich man? If any one would now suffer us, we would take counsel of the things that are profitable! But no one does suffer us. And that we shall so say, is clear, not from him alone, but from many others. And that you may learn this, how many men have been in fevers, and said, if we recover, we shall never again fall into the same state. Many such words we shall then say, but we shall be answered as the rich man was, that there is a gulf, that we have received our <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things here. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse25">Luke 16:25-26</a></span> Let us groan then, I entreat you, bitterly, rather let us not only groan, but pursue <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> too; let us lament now, for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that we may not then lament in vain. Let us weep now, and not weep then, at our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lot. This weeping is of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that of unprofitable repentance; let us afflict ourselves now, that we may not then; for it is not the same thing to be afflicted here and there. Here, you are afflicted for a little time, or rather thou dost not perceive your affliction, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you are afflicted for your good. But there, the affliction is more bitter, because it is not in hope,  nor for any escape, but without limit, and throughout.</p>

<p>But may we all be freed from this, and obtain remission. But let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and be diligent, that we may obtain the remission. Let us be diligent, I entreat; for if we are diligent, we prevail even through our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: if we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> earnestly, God grants our request; but if we neither ask Him, nor do earnestly anything of this sort, nor work, how is it possible that we should ever succeed? By sleeping? Not at all. For it is much if even by running, and stretching forth, and being conformed to His death, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, we shall be able to succeed, not to say sleeping. <q>If by any means I may attain,</q> says he. But if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, <q>If by any means I may attain,</q> what shall we say? For it is not possible by sleeping to accomplish even worldly business, not to say spiritual. By sleeping, not even from friends can anything be received, far less from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Not even fathers <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> them who sleep, far less does God. Let us labor for a little time, that we may have rest for ever. We must at all events be afflicted. If we are not afflicted here, it awaits us there. Why choose we not to be afflicted here, that there we may have rest, and obtain the unspeakable blessings, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, with whom, to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, power, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
