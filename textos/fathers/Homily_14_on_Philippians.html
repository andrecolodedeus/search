<h1>Homily 14 on Philippians</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse4">Philippians 4:4-7</a></span> </p>

<p><q>Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice. Let your forbearance be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The Lord is at hand. In nothing be anxious; but in everything by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which passes all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts through Christ Jesus.</q></p>

<p><q><span class="sc">Blessed </span> are they that mourn,</q> and <q>woe unto them that laugh</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse4">Matthew 5:4</a>; <a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse25">Luke 6:25</a></span>, says Christ. How then says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>Rejoice in the Lord always</q>? <q>Woe to them that laugh,</q> said Christ, the laughter of this world which arises from the things which are present. He blessed also those that mourn, not simply for the loss of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, but those who are pricked at heart, who mourn their own faults, and take count of their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or even those of others. This <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is not contrary to that grief, but from that grief it too is born. For he who grieves for his own faults, and confesses them, rejoices. Moreover, it is possible to grieve for our own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and yet to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Since then they were afflicted by their sufferings, <q>for to you it is given not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him, but also to suffer for him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse29">Philippians 1:29</a></span>, therefore he says, <q>Rejoice in the Lord.</q> For this can but mean, If you exhibit such a life that you may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. Or when your communion with God is not hindered, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. Or else the word <q>in</q> may stand for <q>with</q>:  as if he had said, with the Lord. <q>Alway; again I will say, Rejoice.</q> These are the words of one who brings comfort; as, for example, he who is in God rejoices always. Yea though he be afflicted, yea whatever he may suffer, such a man always rejoices. Hear what Luke says, that <q>they returned from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be scourged for His name.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse41">Acts 5:41</a></span> If scourging and bonds, which seem to be the most grievous of all things, bring forth <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, what else will be able to produce grief in us?</p>

<p><q>Again I will say, Rejoice.</q> Well has he repeated. For since the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the things brought forth grief, he shows by repeating, that they should by all means <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</p>

<p><q>Let your forbearance be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> He said above, <q>Whose god is the belly, and whose <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is in their shame,</q> and that they <q>mind earthly things.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians 3:19</a></span> It was probable that they would be at enmity with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; he therefore exhorted them to have nothing in common with them, but to use them with all forbearance, and that not only their brethren, but also their enemies and opposers. <q>The Lord is at hand,  in nothing be anxious.</q> For why, tell me? Do they ever rise in opposition? And if you see them living in luxury, why are you in affliction? Already the judgment is near; shortly will they give account of their actions. Are ye in affliction, and they in luxury? But these things shall shortly receive their end. Do they plot against you, and threaten you? <q>In nothing be anxious.</q> The judgment is already at hand, when these things shall be reversed. <q>In nothing be anxious.</q> If you are kindly affected toward those who prepare <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you, yet it shall not at last turn out to their profit. Already the recompense is at hand, if poverty, if death, if anything else that is terrible be upon you. <q>But in everything, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> There is this for one consolation, <q>the Lord is at hand.</q> And again, <q>I will be with you always, even unto the end of the world.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse20">Matthew 28:20</a></span> Behold another consolation, a medicine which heals grief, and distress, and all that is painful. And what is this? Prayer, thanksgiving in all things. And so He wills that our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> should not simply be requests, but thanksgivings too for what we have. For how should he ask for future things, who is not thankful for the past? <q>But in everything by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplication.</q> Wherefore we ought to give thanks for all things, even for those which seem to be grievous, for this is the part of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> thankful man. In the other case the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the things demands it; but this springs from a grateful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and one earnestly affected toward God. God acknowledges these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but others He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not. Offer up such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> as may be acknowledged; for He disposes all things for our profit, though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not. And this is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that it greatly profits, namely, that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not. <q>And the peace of God which passes all understanding shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> What means this? <q>The peace of God</q> which He has wrought toward men, surpasses all understanding. For who could have expected, who could have hoped, that such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things would have come? They exceed all man's understanding, not his speech alone. For His enemies, for those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Him, for those who determined to turn themselves away, for these, he refused not to deliver up His Only Begotten Son, that He might make peace with us. This peace then, i.e. the reconciliation, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts.</p>

<p>For this is the part of a teacher, not only to exhort, but also to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and to assist by supplication, that they may neither be overwhelmed by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, nor carried about by deceit. As if he had said, May He who has delivered you in such sort as mind cannot comprehend, may He Himself guard you, and secure you, so that you suffer no ill. Either he means this, or that that peace of which Christ says, <q>Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John 14:27</a></span>: this shall guard you, for this peace exceeds all man's understanding. How? When he tells us to be at peace with our enemies, with those who treat us <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, with those who are at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and enmity toward us; is it not beyond man's understanding? But rather let us look to the former. If the peace surpasses all understanding, much more does God Himself, who gives peace, pass all understanding, not ours only, but also that of Angels, and the Powers above. What means <q>in Christ Jesus</q>? Shall guard us in Him, so that you may remain firm, and not fall from His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse8">Ver. 8</a>. <q>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, whatsoever things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whatsoever things are just.</q> What is <q>Finally</q>? It stands for, <q>I have said all.</q> It is the word of one that is in haste, and has nothing to do with present things.</p>

<p><q>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, whatsoever things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</q></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ver. 9. <q>The things which you both learned and received, and heard and saw in me.</q></p>

<p>What means, <q>whatsoever things are lovely</q>? Lovely to the faithful, lovely to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Whatsoever things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> Virtue is really <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. For the pleasure of it is a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and its <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and all things of the world are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. <q>Whatsoever things are pure.</q> This is opposed to the words <q>who mind earthly things.</q> <q>Whatsoever things are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>.</q> This is opposed to the words <q>whose god is their belly.</q> <q>Whatsoever things are just,</q> i.e. says he,  <q>whatsoever things are of good report.</q> <q>If there be any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if there be any praise.</q> Here he wills them to take thought of those things too which regard men. <q>Think on these things,</q> says he. Do you see, that he desires to banish every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought from our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> actions spring from thoughts. <q>The things which you both learned and received.</q> This is teaching, in all his exhortations to propose himself for a model: as he says in another place, <q>even as you have us for an ensample.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse17">Philippians 3:17</a></span> And again here, <q>What things ye learned and received,</q> i.e. have been taught by word of mouth, <q>and heard and saw in me</q>: both in respect of my words and actions and conduct. Do you see, how about everything he lays these commands on us? For since it was not possible to make an accurate enumeration of all things, of our coming in, and going out, and speech, and carriage, and intercourse (for of all these things it is needful that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> should have thought), he said shortly, and as it were in a summary, <q>ye heard and saw in me.</q> I have led you forward both by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and by words.  <q>These things do,</q> not only in words, but <em>do</em> them also. <q>And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace shall be with you,</q> i.e. you shall be in a calm, in great safety, you shall suffer nothing painful, nor contrary to your will. For when we are at peace with Him, and we are so through <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, much more will He be at peace with us. For He who so loved us, as to show favor to us even against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, will He not, if He sees us hastening toward Him, Himself yet much more exhibit His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward us?</p>

<p>Nothing is such an enemy of our nature as <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. And from many things it is evident, how <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is at enmity with us, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> friendly toward us. What will you? That I should speak of fornication? It makes men subject to reproach, poor, objects of ridicule, despicable to all, just as enemies treat them. Ofttimes it has involved men in disease and danger; many men have perished or been wounded in behalf of their mistresses. And if fornication produces these things, much rather does <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. But does almsgiving so? By no means. But as a loving mother sets her son in great propriety, in good order, in good report, and gives him leisure to engage in necessary work, thus <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> does not release us nor lead us away from our necessary work, but even renders the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more wise. For nothing is more foolish than a mistress.</p>

<p>But what do you will? To look upon <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>? It too treats us like an enemy. And how? It makes us <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by all. It prepares all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to vaunt themselves against us; both those who have been treated <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> by us, and those who have not, who share the grief of the former, and are in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for themselves. All men look upon us as their common foes, as wild beasts, as <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Everywhere are there innumerable accusations, plots against us, envyings, all which are the acts of enemies. But <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, on the contrary, makes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> friends, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> sociable, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> well disposed towards us, by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are made in our behalf; our affairs are in perfect safety, there is no danger, there is no suspicion. But sleep also fearlessly comes over us with perfect safety, no care is there, no lamenting.</p>

<p>How much better this sort of life is! And what? Is it best to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, or to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with one another? Let us search out all these things, and we shall find that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, like a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> kind mother, places us in safety, while <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is a treacherous thing, and full of danger. For hear the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, who says, <q>The Lord is a stronghold of them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him, and His covenant is to show them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa024.htm#verse14">Psalm 25:14</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> He fears no one, who is not conscious to himself of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; on the contrary, he who lives in crime is never confident, but trembles at his domestics, and looks at them with suspicion. Why say, his domestics? He cannot bear the tribunal of his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Not only those who are without, but his inward thoughts affect him likewise, and suffer him not to be in quiet. What then, says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Ought we to live dependent on praise? He said not, look to praise, but do praiseworthy actions, yet not for the sake of praise.</p>

<p><q>Whatsoever things are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q> for the things we have been speaking of are false. <q>Whatsoever things are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>.</q> That which is <q><a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a></q> belongs to external <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that which is <q>pure</q> to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Give no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of stumbling, says he, nor handle of accusation. Because he had said, <q>Whatsoever things are of good report,</q> lest you should think that he means only those things which are so in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he proceeds, <q>if there be any <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and if there be any praise, think on these things</q>&mdash; do these things. He wills us ever to be in these things, to care for these things, to think on these things. For if we will be at peace with each other, God too will be with us, but if we raise up <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace will not be with us. For nothing is so hostile to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. That is, peace and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> place it in safety. Wherefore we must make a beginning on our part, and then we shall draw God toward us.</p>

<p>God is not a God of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and fighting. Make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and fighting to cease, both that which is against Him, and that which is against your neighbor. Be at peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, consider with what character God saves you. <q>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew 5:9</a></span> Such always imitate the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>: do thou imitate Him too. Be at peace. The more your brother <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against you, by so much the greater will be your reward. For hear the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who says, <q>With the haters of peace I was peaceful.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa119.htm#verse7">Psalm 120:7</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> This is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, this is above man's understanding, this makes us near <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nothing so much delights God as to remember no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. This sets you free from your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, this looses the charges against you: but if we are fighting and buffeting, we become far off from God: for enmities are produced by conflict, and from enmity springs remembrance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>Cut out the root, and there will be no fruit. Thus shall we learn to despise the things of this life, for there is no conflict, none, in spiritual things, but whatever you see, either conflicts or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, or whatever a man can mention, all these spring from the things of this life. Every conflict has its beginning either in <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, or vainglory. If therefore we are at peace, we shall learn to despise the things of the earth. Hath a man stolen our money? He has not injured us, only let him not steal our treasure which is above. Hath he hindered your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? Yet not that which is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that which is of no account. For this is no <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but a mere name of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or rather a shame. Hath he stolen your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>? Rather not yours but his own. For as he who commits <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> does not so much inflict as receive <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, thus too he who plots against his neighbor, first destroys himself.</p>

<p>For <q>he who digs a pit for his neighbor, falls into it.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse27">Proverbs 26:27</a></span> Let us then not plot against others, lest we injure ourselves. When we supplant the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of others, let us consider that we injure ourselves, it is against ourselves we plot. For perchance with men we do him harm, if we have power, but we injure ourselves in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by provoking Him against us. Let us not then harm ourselves. For as we injure ourselves when we injure our neighbors, so by benefiting them we benefit ourselves. If then your enemy harm you, he has benefited you if you are wise, and so requite him not with the same things, but even do him good. But the blow, you say, remains severe. Consider then that thou dost not benefit, but punishest him, and benefitest yourself, and quickly you will come to do him good. What then? Shall we act from this motive? We ought not to act on this motive, but if your heart will not hear other reason, induce it, says he,  even by this, and you will quickly persuade it to dismiss its enmity, and wilt for the future do good to your enemy as to a friend, and wilt obtain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are to come, to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant that we may all attain in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
