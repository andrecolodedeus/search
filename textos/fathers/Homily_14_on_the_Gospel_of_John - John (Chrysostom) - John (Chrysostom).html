<h1>Homily 14 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 1:16</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And of His fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.</q></div>

<p>1. I said the other day, that John, to resolve the doubts of those who should question with themselves how the Lord, though He came after to the preaching, became before and more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than he, added, <q>for He was before me.</q> And this is indeed one reason. But not content with this, he adds again a second, which now he declares. What is it? <q>And of his fullness,</q> says he, <q>have all we received, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> With these again he mentions another. What is this? That</p>

<h2>John 1:17</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>The law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</q></div>

<p>And what means that, says he, <q>Of His fullness have all we received</q>? For to this we must for a while direct our discourse. He possesses not, says he, the gift by participation,  but is Himself the very Fountain and very Root of all good, very Life, and very Light, and very Truth, not retaining within Himself the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, but overflowing with them unto all others, and after the overflowing remaining full, in nothing diminished by supplying others, but streaming ever forth, and imparting to others a share of these blessings, He remains in sameness of perfection. What I possess is by participation, (for I received it from another) and is a small portion of the whole, as it were a poor  rain-drop compared with the untold abyss or the boundless sea; or rather not even can this instance fully express what we attempt to say, for if you take a drop from the sea, you have lessened the sea itself,  though the diminution be imperceptible. But of that Fountain we cannot say this; how much soever a man draw, It continues undiminished. We therefore must needs proceed to another instance, a weak one also, and not able to establish what we seek, but which guides us better than the former one to the thought now proposed to us.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that there is a fountain of fire; that from that fountain ten thousand lamps are kindled, twice as many, thrice as many, ofttimes as many; does not the fire remain at the same degree of fullness even after its imparting of its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to such members? It is plain to every man that it does. Now if in the case of bodies which are made up of parts, and are diminished by abstraction, one has been found of such a nature, that after supplying to others something from itself it sustains no loss, much more will  this take place with that incorporeal and uncompounded Power. If in the instance given, that which is communicated is substance and body, is divided yet does not suffer division, when our discourse is concerning an energy, and an energy too of an incorporeal substance, it is much more probable that this will undergo nothing of the sort. And therefore John said, <q>Of His fullness have all we received,</q> and joins his own testimony to that of the Baptist; for the expression, <q>Of his fullness have we all received,</q> belongs not to the forerunner but to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>; and its meaning is something like this: <q>Think not,</q> he says, <q>that we, who long time companied with Him, and partook of His food  and table, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> through favor,</q> since even John, who did not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him before, who had never even been with Him, but merely saw Him in company with others when he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> cried out, <q>He was before me,</q> having from that source  received all; and all we the twelve, the three hundred, the three thousand, the five thousand, the many myriads of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, all the fullness of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who then were, and now are, and hereafter shall be, have <q>received of His fullness.</q> What have we received? <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,</q> says he. What <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, for what? For the old, the new. For there was a righteousness, and again a righteousness, (<q>Touching the righteousness which is in the law,</q> says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <q>blameless.</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse6">Philippians 3:6</a></span> There was a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, there is a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. (<q>From <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans 1:17</a></span> There was an adoption, there is an adoption. (<q>To whom pertains the adoption.</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse4">Romans 9:4</a></span> There was a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, there is a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. (<q>For if that which was done away was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, much more that which remains is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse11">2 Corinthians 3:11</a></span> There was a law, and there is a law. (<q>For the law of the Spirit of life has made me free.</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans 8:2</a></span> There was a service, and there is a service. (<q>To whom pertains the service</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse4">Romans 9:4</a></span> and again: <q>Serving God in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse3">Philippians 3:3</a></span> There was a covenant, and there is a covenant. (<q>I will make with you  a new covenant, not according to the covenant which I made with your  fathers.</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse31">Jeremiah 31:31</a></span> There was a sanctification, and there is a sanctification: there was a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and there is a Baptism: there was a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and there is a Sacrifice: there was a temple, and there is a temple: there was a <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and there is a <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>; and so too there was a <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,</q> and there is a <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> But the words in the first case are used as types, in the second as realities, preserving a sameness of sound, though not of sense. So in patterns and figures, the shape of a man scratched with white lines  upon a black ground is called a man as well as that which has received the correct coloring; and in the case of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, the figure whether formed of gold or of plaster, is alike called a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a>, though in the one case as a model, in the other as a reality.</p>

<p>2. Do not then, because the same words are used, suppose that the things are identical, nor yet diverse either; for in that they were models they did not differ from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but in that they merely preserved the outline, they were less than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. What is the difference in all these instances? Will you that we take in hand and proceed to examine one or two of the cases mentioned? Thus the rest will be plain to you; and we shall see that the first were lessons for children, the last for high-minded full-grown men; that the first <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were made as for mortals, the latter as for <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>Whence then shall we begin? From the sonship itself? What then is the distinction between the first and second? The first is the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of a name, in the second the thing goes with it. Of the first the Prophet says, <q>I have said, You are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa081.htm#verse6">Psalm 82:6</a></span>; but of the latter, that they <q>were born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> How, and in what way? By the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For they, even after they had received the title of sons, retained the spirit of slavery, (for while they remained slaves they were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with this appellation,) but we being made free, received the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, not in name, but in deed. And this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has declared and said, <q>For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a></span> For having been born again,  and, as one may say, thoroughly remade,  we so are called <q>sons.</q> And if one consider the character of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, what the first was and what the second, he will find there also great  difference. They when they did not worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, nor commit fornication or <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, were called by this name; but we become <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, not by refraining from these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> merely, but by acquiring things greater. And this gift we obtain first by means of the coming upon us of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and next, by a rule of life far more comprehensive  than that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. To prove that these words are not mere boasting hear what He says to them, <q>You shall not use <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a>,  nor make purification of your children, for you are a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people.</q>  So that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> with them consisted  in being free from the customs of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; but it is not so with us. <q>That she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>in body and spirit.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1 Corinthians 7:34</a></span> <q>Follow peace, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, without which no man shall see the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews 12:14</a></span>: and, <q>Perfecting <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse1">2 Corinthians 7:1</a></span> For the word <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a></q> has not force to give the same meaning in every case to which it is applied; since God is called <q>Holy,</q> though not as we are. What, for instance, does the Prophet say, when he heard that cry raised  by the flying Seraphim? <q>Woe is me! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse5">Isaiah 6:5</a></span>; though he was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and clean; but if we be compared with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which is above, we are unclean. Angels are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, Archangels are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, the Cherubim and Seraphim themselves are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, but of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> again there is a double difference; that is, in relation to us, and to the higher powers.  We might proceed to all the other points, but then the discussion would become too long, and its extent too great. We will therefore desist from proceeding farther, and leave it to you to take in hand the rest, for it is in your power at home to put these things together, and examine their difference, and in the same way to go over what remains. <q>Give,</q> says one, <q>a starting place to the wise, and he becomes wiser.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse9">Proverbs 9:9</a> , <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> The beginning is from us, but the end will be from you. We must now resume the connection.</p>

<p>After having said, <q>Of His fullness have all we received,</q> he adds, <q>and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> For by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were saved: <q>I chose you,</q> says <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>not because you were many in number, but because of your fathers.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse7">Deuteronomy 7:7</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> If now they were chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> not for their own good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>,  it is manifest that by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> they obtained this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. And we too all are saved by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but not in like manner; not for the same objects, but for objects much greater and higher. The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> then that is with us is not like theirs. For not only was pardon of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> given to us, (since this we have in common with them, for all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,) but righteousness also, and sanctification, and sonship, and the gift of the Spirit far more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>  and more abundant. By this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we have become the beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, no longer as servants, but as sons and friends. Wherefore he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> Since even the things of the law were of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and the very fact of man  being created from nothing, (for we did not receive this as a recompense for past good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, how could we, when we even were not? But from God who is ever the first to bestow His benefits,) and not only that we were created from nothing, but that when created, we straightway learned what we must and what we must not do, and that we received this law in our very nature, and that our Creator entrusted to us the impartial rule of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, these I say, are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the greatest <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and unspeakable lovingkindness. And the recovery of this law after it had become corrupt, by means of the written (Law), this too was the work of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For what might have been expected to follow was, that they who falsified  the law once given should suffer correction and punishments; but what actually took place was not this, but, on the contrary, an amending of our nature, and pardon, not of debt, but given through mercy and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For to show that it was of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy, hear what David says; <q>The Lord executes righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed; He made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> His ways unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, His acts unto the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa103.htm#verse6">Psalm 103:6-7</a></span>: and again; <q>Good and upright is the Lord, therefore will He give <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to them that are in the way.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa024.htm#verse8">Psalm 25:8</a></span></p>

<p>3. Therefore that men received the law was of pity, mercies, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and for this reason he says, <q>Grace for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> But striving yet more fervently  to (express) the greatness of the gifts, he goes on to say,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17"> Ver. 17 </a> . <q>The law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>Do you see how gently, by a single word and little by little, both John the Baptist and John the Disciple lead up their hearers to the highest <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, having first exercised them in humbler things? The former having compared to himself Him who is incomparably superior to all, thus afterwards shows His superiority, by saying, <q>has become before me,</q> and then adding the words, <q>was before me</q>: while the latter has done much more than he, though too little for the worthiness of the Only-Begotten, for he makes the comparison, not with John, but with one reverenced by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> more than John, with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. <q>For the law,</q> says he, <q>was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>Observe his wisdom. He makes enquiry not concerning the person, but the things; for these being <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, it was probable that even the senseless would of necessity receive from them a much higher judgment and notion respecting Christ. For when facts bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, which cannot be suspected  of doing so either from favor to any, or from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, they afford a means of judging which cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> even by the  senseless; for they remain to open view just as their actors may have arranged them, and therefore their evidence is the least liable to suspicion of any. And see how he makes the comparison easy even to the weaker sort; for he does not prove the superiority by argument, but points out the difference by the bare words, opposing <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q> to <q>law,</q> and <q>came</q> to <q>was given.</q> Between each of these there is a great difference; for one, <q>was given,</q> belongs to something ministered, when one has received from another, and given to whom he was commanded to give; but the other, <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came,</q> befits a king forgiving all offenses, with authority, and himself furnishing the gift. Wherefore He said, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be forgiven you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse2">Matthew 9:2</a></span>; and again, <q>But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> has power on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (He says to the sick of the palsy), Arise, take up your bed, and go unto your house.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse6">Matthew 5:6</a></span></p>

<p>Seest  thou how <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></q> comes by Him? Look also to <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> His <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></q> the instance just mentioned, and what happened in the case of the thief, and the gift of Baptism, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit given by Him  declare, and many other things. But His <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q> we shall more clearly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, if we understand the types. For the types like patterns anticipated and sketched beforehand the dispensations  which should be accomplished under the new covenant, and Christ came and fulfilled them. Let us now consider the types in few words, for we cannot at the present time go through all that relates to them; but when you have learned some points from those (instances) which I shall set before you,  you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the others also.</p>

<p>Will you then that we begin with the Passion itself? What then says the type? <q>Take a lamb for an house, and kill it, and do as he commanded and ordained.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse3">Exodus 12:3</a></span> But it is not so with Christ. He does not command this to be done, but Himself becomes It,  by offering Himself a Sacrifice and Oblation to His Father.</p>

<p>4. See how the type was <q>given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q> but the <q>Truth came by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse12">Exodus 17:12</a></span></p>

<p>Again, when the Amalekites warred in Mount Sinai, the hands of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were supported, being stayed up by <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and Hur standing on either side of him <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo017.htm#verse12">Exodus 17:12</a></span>; but when Christ came, He of Himself stretched forth His Hands upon the Cross. Have you observed how the type <q>was given,</q> but <q>the Truth came</q>?</p>

<p>Again, the Law said, <q>Cursed is every one that continues not in all things that are written in this book.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu027.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy 27:26</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> But what says <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? <q>Come unto Me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew 11:28</a></span>; and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians 3:13</a></span></p>

<p>Since then we have enjoyed such <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></q> and <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> I exhort you that we be not more <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> by reason of the greatness of the gift; for the greater the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of which we have been deemed worthy, the greater our debt of excellence; for one who has received but small benefits, even though he makes but small returns, does not deserve the same condemnation; but he who has been raised to the highest summit of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and yet manifests groveling and mean dispositions, will be worthy of much greater punishment. May I never have to suspect this of you. For we trust in the Lord that you have winged your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> for heaven, that you have removed from earth, that being in the world you handle not the things of the world; yet though so persuaded, we do not cease thus continually to exhort you. In the games of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, they whom all the spectators encourage are not those who have fallen and lie supine, but those who are exerting themselves and running still; of the others, (since they would be doing what would be of no use,  and would not be able to raise up by their encouragements men once for all severed from victory,) they cease to take any notice. But in this case some good may be expected, not only of you who are sober, but even of those who have fallen, if they would but be converted. Wherefore we use every means, exhorting, reproving, encouraging, praising, in order that we may bring about your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Be not then offended by our continual admonishing concerning the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> conversation, for the words are not the words of one accusing you of sloth, but of one who has very excellent hopes respecting you. And not to you alone, but to ourselves who speak them, are these words said, yea, and shall be said, for we too need the same teaching; so though they be spoken by us, yet nothing hinders their being spoken to us, (for the Word, when it finds a man in fault, amends him, when clear and free, sets him as far off from it as possible,) and we ourselves are not pure from transgressions. The course of healing is the same for all, the medicines are set forth for all, only the application is not the same, but is made according to the choice of those who use the medicines; for one who will handle the remedy as he ought, gains some benefit from the application, while he who  does not place it upon the wound, makes the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> greater, and brings it to the most painful end. Let us then not fret when we are being healed, but much rather <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, even though the system of discipline bring bitter pains, for hereafter it will show to us fruit sweeter than any. Let us then do all to this end, that we may depart to that world,  cleared of the wounds and strokes which the teeth of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> make in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, so that having become worthy to behold the countenance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we may be delivered in that day, not to the avenging and cruel powers, but to those who are able to bring us to that inheritance of the heavens which is prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him; to which may it come to pass that we all attain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
