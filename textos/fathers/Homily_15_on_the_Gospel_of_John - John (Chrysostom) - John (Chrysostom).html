<h1>Homily 15 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 1:18</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>No man has seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</q></div>

<p>1. God will not have us listen to the words and sentences contained in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> carelessly, but with much attention. This is why the blessed David has prefixed in many places to his Psalms the title <q>for understanding,</q>  and has said, <q>Open Thou my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Your Law.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa032.htm#verse42">Psalm 32:42</a>, etc.; <a href="../bible/psa119.htm#verse18">Psalm 119:18</a></span> And after him his son again shows that we ought to <q>seek out wisdom as silver,  and to make merchandise of her rather than of gold.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse4">Proverbs 2:4</a> and <a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse14">3:14</a> [partially quoted]; <a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John 5:39</a></span> And the Lord when He exhorts the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to <q>search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,</q> the more urges us to the enquiry, for He would not thus have spoken if it were possible to comprehend them immediately at the first reading. No one would ever search for what is obvious and at hand, but for that which is wrapt in shadow, and which must be found after much enquiry; and so to arouse us to the search He calls them <q>hidden treasure.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro002.htm#verse4">Proverbs 2:4</a>; <a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse44">Matthew 13:44</a></span> These words are said to us that we may not apply ourselves to the words of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> carelessly or in a chance way, but with great exactness. For if any one listen to what is said in them without enquiring into the meaning, and receive all so as it is spoken, according to the letter, he will suppose many unseemly things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will admit of Him that He is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, that He is made of brass, is wrathful, is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a>, and many opinions yet worse than these. But if he fully learn the sense that lies beneath, he will be freed from all this unseemliness. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse15">Revelation 1:15</a></span> The very text which now lies before us says, that God has a bosom, a thing proper to bodily substances, yet no one is so insane as to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, that He who is without body is a body. In order then that we may properly interpret the entire passage according to its spiritual meaning, let us search it through from its beginning.</p>

<p><q>No man has seen God at any time.</q> By what connection of thought does the Apostle come to say this? After showing the exceeding greatness of the gifts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> difference between them and those ministered by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, he would add the reasonable <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the difference. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as being a servant, was minister of lower things, but Christ being Lord and King, and the King's Son, brought to us things far greater, being ever with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and beholding Him continually; wherefore He says, <q>No man has seen God at any time.</q> What then shall we answer to the most mighty of voice, Esaias, when he says, <q>I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse1">Isaiah 6:1</a></span>; and to John himself testifying of Him, that <q>he said these things when he had seen His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse41">John 12:41</a></span> What also to Ezekiel? For he too beheld Him sitting above the Cherubim. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze001.htm">Ezekiel 1</a> and <a href="../bible/eze010.htm">10</a></span> What to Daniel? For he too says, <q>The Ancient of days did sit</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/dan007.htm#verse9">Daniel 7:9</a></span> What to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself, saying, <q>Show me Your Glory, that I may see You so as to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse13">Exodus 33:13</a>, partly from <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> And Jacob took his name from this very thing, being called  <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q>; for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is <q>one that sees God.</q>  And others have seen him. How then says John, <q>No man has seen God at any time</q>? It is to declare, that all these were instances of (His) condescension, not the vision of the Essence itself unveiled. For had they  seen the very Nature, they would not have beheld It under different forms, since that is simple, without <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, or parts, or bounding lines. It sits not, nor stands, nor walks: these things belong all to bodies. But how He Is, He only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. And this He has declared by a certain <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes  by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/hos012.htm#verse10">Hosea 12:10</a></span>, that is, <q>I have condescended, I have not appeared as I really was.</q> For since His Son was about to appear in very flesh, He prepared them from old time to behold the substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as far as it was possible for them to see It; but what God really is, not only have not the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> seen, but not even <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> nor archangels. If you ask them, you shall not hear them answering anything concerning His Essence, but sending up,  <q>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the Highest, on earth peace, good will towards men.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke 2:14</a></span> If you desire to learn something from Cherubim or Seraphim, you shall hear the mystic song of His Holiness, and that <q>heaven and earth are full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse3">Isaiah 6:3</a></span> If you enquire of the higher powers, you shall but find  that their one work is the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Praise Him,</q> says David, <q>all His hosts.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa147.htm#verse2">Psalm 148:2</a></span> But the Son only Beholds Him, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. How can any created nature even see the Uncreated? If we are absolutely unable clearly to discern any incorporeal power whatsoever, even though created, as has been often <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the case of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, much less can we discern the Essence which is incorporeal and uncreated. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>Whom no man has seen, nor can see.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1 Timothy 6:16</a></span> Does then this special attribute  belong to the Father only, not to the Son? Away with the thought. It belongs also to the Son; and to show that it does so, hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declaring this point, and saying, that He <q>is the Image of the invisible God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians 1:15</a></span> Now if He be the Image of the Invisible, He must be invisible Himself, for otherwise He would not be an <q>image.</q> And wonder not that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says in another place, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was manifested in the Flesh</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse16">1 Timothy 3:16</a></span>; because the manifestation  took place by means of the flesh, not according to (His) Essence. Besides, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> shows that He is invisible, not only to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also to the powers above, for after saying, <q>was manifested in the Flesh,</q> he adds, <q>was seen of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q></p>

<p>2. So that even to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> He then became visible, when He put on the Flesh; but before that time they did not so behold Him, because even to them His Essence was invisible.</p>

<p><q>How then,</q> asks some one, <q>did Christ say, 'Despise not one of these little ones, for I tell you, that their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do always behold the face of My Father which is in heaven'? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew 18:10</a></span> Hath then God a face, and is He bounded by the heavens?</q> Who so mad as to assert this? What then is the meaning of the words? As when He says, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew 5:8</a></span>, He means that intellectual vision which is possible to us, and the having God in the thoughts; so in the case of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, we must understand  that by reason of their pure and sleepless  nature they do nothing else, but always image to themselves God. And therefore Christ says, that <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save the Son.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse27">Matthew 10:27</a></span> What then, are we all in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>? God forbid; but none <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him as the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him. As then many  have seen Him in the mode of vision permitted to them, but no one has beheld His Essence, so many of us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but what His substance can be none <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, save only He that was begotten of Him. For by <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q> He here means an exact idea and comprehension, such as the Father has of the Son. <q>As the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Me, even so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I the Father.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse15">John 10:15</a></span></p>

<p>Observe, therefore, with what fullness  the Evangelist speaks; for having said that <q>no man has seen God at any time,</q> he does not go on to say, <q>that the Son who has seen, has declared Him,</q> but adds something beyond <q>seeing</q> by the words, <q>Who is in the bosom of the Father</q>; because, <q>to dwell  in the bosom</q> is far more than <q>to see.</q> For he that merely <q>sees</q> has not an in every way exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the object, but he that <q>dwells in the bosom</q> can be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of nothing. Now lest when you hear that <q>none <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> you should assert that although He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father more than all, yet He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how great He is, the Evangelist says that He dwells in the bosom of the Father; and Christ Himself declares, that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him as much as the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son. Ask therefore the gainsayer, <q>Tell me, does the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Son?</q> And if he be not mad, he will certainly answer <q>Yes.</q> Then ask again; <q>Does He see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him with exact vision and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? Does He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> clearly what He Is?</q> He will certainly confess this also. From this next collect the exact comprehension the Son has of the Father. For He says, <q>As the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> me, even so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I the Father</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse15">John 10:15</a></span>; and in another place, <q>Not that any man has seen the  Father, save He which is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse46">John 6:46</a></span> Wherefore, as I said, the Evangelist mentions <q>the bosom,</q> to show all this to us by that one word; that great is the affinity and nearness of the Essence, that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is nowise different, that the power is equal. For the Father would not have in His bosom one of another <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, nor would He have dared, had He been one among many servants, to live  in the bosom of his Lord, for this belongs only to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son, to one who has  much confidence towards His Father, and who is in nothing inferior to Him.</p>

<p>Would you learn also His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>? Hear what <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says concerning the Father. When he asked what he was commanded to answer should the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> enquire of him, <q>Who it was that had sent him,</q> he heard these words: <q>Say, I AM has sent me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus 3:14</a></span> Now the expression <q>I AM,</q>  is significative of Being ever, and Being without beginning, of Being really and absolutely. And this also the expression, <q>Was in the beginning,</q> declares, being indicative of Being ever; so that John uses this word to show that the Son Is from everlasting to everlasting  in the bosom of the Father. For that you may not from the sameness of name, suppose that He is some one of those who are made sons by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, first, the article is added, distinguishing Him from those by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But if this does not content you, if you still look earthwards, hear a name more absolute than this, <q>Only-Begotten.</q> If even after this you still look below, <q>I will not refuse,</q> says he, (St. John,) <q>to apply to God a term belonging to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I mean the word 'bosom,' only suspect nothing degrading.</q> Do you see the lovingkindness and carefulness of the Lord? God applies  to Himself unworthy expressions, that even so you may see through them, and have some great and lofty thought of Him; and do you tarry below? For tell me, wherefore is that gross and carnal word <q>bosom</q> employed in this place? Is it that we may suppose God to be a body? Away, he by no means says so. Why then is it spoken? For if by it neither the genuineness of the Son is established, nor that God is not a body, the word, because it serves no purpose, is superfluously thrown in. Why then is it spoken? For I shall not desist from asking you this question. Is it not very plain, that it is for no other reason but that by it we might understand the genuineness of the Only-Begotten, and His Co-<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> with the Father?</p>

<p>3. <q>He has declared Him,</q> says John. What has he declared? That <q>no man has seen God at any time</q>? That <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one</q>? But this all the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> testify, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> continually  exclaims, <q>The Lord your God is one Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy 6:4</a></span>; and Esaias, <q>Before Me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa043.htm#verse10">Isaiah 43:10</a></span> What more then have we learned from <q>the Son which is in the bosom of the Father</q>? What from <q>the Only-Begotten</q>? In the first place, these very words were uttered by His working; in the next place, we have received a teaching that is far clearer, and learned that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a></span>; and again, that it is impossible to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <q>that no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a></q> Him, <q>save the Son</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew 11:27</a></span>; that He is the Father of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and Only-Begotten; and all other things that are told us of Him. But the word <q>has declared</q>  shows the plainer and clearer teaching which He gave not to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only but to all the world, and established. To the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> not even all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gave heed, but to the Only-Begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> all the world yielded and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>. So the <q>declaration</q> in this place shows the greater clearness of His teaching, and therefore also He is called <q>Word,</q> and <q>Angel  of great Counsel.</q> </p>

<p>Since then we have been vouchsafed a larger and more perfect teaching, God having no longer spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but <q>having in these last days spoken to us by His Son</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse1">Hebrews 1:1</a></span>, let us show forth a conversation far higher than theirs, and suitable to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> bestowed on us. Strange would it be that He should have so far lowered Himself, as to choose to speak to us no longer by His servants, but by His own mouth, and yet we should show forth nothing more than those of old. They had <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for their teacher, we, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> Lord. Let us then exhibit a heavenly wisdom  worthy of this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and let us have nothing to do with earth. It was for this that He brought His teaching from heaven above, that He might remove our thoughts there, that we might be imitators of our Teacher according to our power. But how may we become imitators of Christ? By acting in everything for the common good, and not merely seeking our own. <q>For even Christ,</q> says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>pleased not Himself, but as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached You fell on Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse3">Romans 15:3</a>; <a href="../bible/psa069.htm#verse9">Psalm 69:9</a></span> Let no one therefore seek his own. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, a man (really) seeks his own good when he looks to that of his neighbor. What is their good is ours; we are one body, and parts and limbs one of another. Let us not then be as though we were rent asunder. Let no one say, <q>such a person is no  friend of mine, nor relation, nor neighbor, I have nought to do with him, how shall I approach, how address him?</q> Though he be neither relation nor friend, yet he is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who shares the same nature with you, owns the same Lord, is your fellow-servant, and fellow-sojourner,  for he is born in the same world. And if besides he partakes of the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, behold he has also become a member of you: for what friendship could work such union, as the relationship of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? And our intimacy one with another must not be such nearness only as friends ought to show to friends, but such as is between limb and limb, because no man can possibly discover any intimacy greater than this sort of friendship and fellowship.  As then you cannot say, <q>Whence arises my intimacy and connection with this limb?</q> (that would be ridiculous;) so neither can you say so in the case of your brother. <q>We are all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into one body</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 12:13</a></span>, says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. <q>Wherefore into one body?</q> That we be not rent asunder, but preserve the just proportions of that one body by our intercourse and friendship one with another.</p>

<p>Let us not then despise one another, lest we be neglectful of ourselves.  <q>For no man ever yet <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse29">Ephesians 5:29</a></span> And therefore God has given to us but one habitation, this earth, has distributed all things equally, has lighted one sun for us all, has spread above us one roof, the sky, made one table, the earth, bear  food for us. And another table has He given far better than this, yet that too is one, (those who share our <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> understand my words,) one manner of birth He has bestowed on all, the spiritual, we all have one country, that in the heavens, of the same cup drink we all. He has not bestowed on the rich man a gift more abundant and more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, and on the poor one more mean and small, but He has called all alike. He has given carnal things with equal regard to all,  and spiritual in like manner. Whence then proceeds the great inequality of conditions in life? From the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>. But let not, brethren, let not this any longer be; and when matters of universal interest and more pressing necessity bring us together, let us not be divided by things earthly and insignificant: I mean, by <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and poverty, by bodily relationship, by enmity and friendship; for all these things are a shadow, nay less substantial than a shadow, to those who possess the bond of charity from above. Let us then preserve this unbroken, and none of those <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>  will be able to enter in, who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> division in so perfect union;  to which may we all attain by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
