<h1>Homily 15 on the Statues</h1>

<p><strong> <em>Again on the calamity of the city of Antioch. That fear is every way profitable. That sorrow is more useful than laughter. And upon the saying, <q>Remember that you walk in the midst of snares.</q></em>  <em>And that it is worse to exact an oath, than to commit murder.</em></strong></p>

<p>1. Today, and on the former <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>,  it had behooved us to enter on the subject of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; nor let any one suppose that what I said was unseasonable.  For on the days of the fast, counsel and admonition on that subject are indeed not at all necessary; the very presence of these days exciting even those who are the most remiss to the effort of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. But since many men, both when about to enter upon the fast, as if the belly were on the point of being delivered over to a sort of lengthened seige, lay in beforehand a stock of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>; and again, on being set at liberty, going forth as from a long famine and a grievous <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, run to the table with unseemly greediness, just as if they were striving to undo again the advantage gained through the fast, by an excess of <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>; it might have been needful, that then as well as now, we should agitate the subject of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Nevertheless, we have neither lately said any thing of that kind, neither shall we now speak upon it. For the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the impending calamity suffices, instead of the strongest admonition and counsel, to sober the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of every one. For who is there so miserable and degraded, as to be drunken in such a tempest? Who is there so insensible, when the city is thus agitated, and such a shipwreck is threatened, as not to become abstemious and watchful, and more thoroughly reformed by this distress than by any other sort of admonition and counsel? For discourse will not be able to effect as much as <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> does. And this very thing it is now possible to show from the events which have taken place. How many words then did we spend before this in exhorting many that were listless, and counselling them to abstain from the theatres, and the impurities of these places! And still they did not abstain; but always on this day they flocked together to the unlawful spectacles of the dancers; and they held their diabolical assembly in opposition  to the full congregation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s Church; so that their vehement shouts, borne in the air from that place, resounded against the psalms which we were singing here. But behold, now while we were keeping silence, and saying nothing on the subject, they of themselves have shut up their orchestra; and the Hippodrome has been left deserted! Before this, many of our own people used to hasten to them; but now they are all fled hither from thence to the church, and all alike join in praising our God!</p>

<p>2. Do you see what advantage has come of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? If <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> were not a good thing, fathers would not have set tutors  over their children; nor lawgivers magistrates for cities. What can be more grievous than <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>? Yet nothing is more profitable than the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of it; for the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will bring us the crown of the kingdom. Where <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is, there is no <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; where <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is, the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> does not disturb; where <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is quenched, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscence is repressed, and every unreasonable passion is exterminated. And even as in a house, where there is always a soldier under arms, no robber, nor house-breaker, nor any such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doer will dare to make his appearance; so also while <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> holds possession of our minds, none of the base <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> will readily attack us, but all fly off and are banished, being driven away in every direction by the despotic power of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. And not only this advantage do we gain from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, but also another which is far greater. For not only, indeed, does it expel our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, but it also introduces every kind of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with great facility. Where <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> exists, there is <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, and intensity of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and tears warm and frequent, and groans fraught with compunction. For nothing so swallows up <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and makes <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to increase and flourish, as a perpetual state of dread. Therefore it is impossible for him who does not live in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to act aright; as, on the other hand, it is impossible that the man who lives in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> can go wrong.</p>

<p>3. Let us not then grieve, beloved, let us not despond on account of the present tribulation, but let us admire the well-devised plan of God's wisdom. For by these very means through which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> hoped to overturn our city, has God restored and corrected it. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> animated certain lawless men to treat the very <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of the Emperor contemptuously, in order that the very foundations of the city might be razed. But God employed this same circumstance for our greater correction; driving out all sloth by the dread of the expected <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>: and the thing has turned out directly opposite to what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> wished, by the means which he had himself prepared. For our city is being purified every day; and the lanes and crossings, and places of public concourse, are freed from lascivious and voluptuous songs; and turn where we will there are supplications, and thanksgivings, and tears, instead of rude laughter; there are words of sound wisdom instead of obscene language, and our whole city has become a Church, the workshops being closed, and all being engaged throughout the day in these general <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; and calling upon God in one united voice with much earnestness. What preaching, what admonition, what counsel, what length of time had ever availed to accomplish these things?</p>

<p>4. For this then let us be thankful, and let us not be petulant or discontented; for that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is a good thing, what we have said has made manifest. But hear Solomon thus uttering a lesson of wisdom concerning it; Solomon, who was nourished in every luxury, and enjoyed much security. What then does he say? <q>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of laughter.</q>  What do you say, I ask? Is it better to go where there is weeping, lamentation, and groans, and anguish, and so much sadness, than where there is the dance, the cymbals, and laughter, and luxury, and full eating and drinking? Yes, verily, he replies. And tell me why is it so, and for what reason? Because, at the former place, insolence is bred, at the latter, sobriety. And when a person goes to the banquet of one more opulent, he will no longer behold his own house with the same pleasure, but he comes back to his wife in a discontented mood; and in discontent he partakes of his own table; and is peevish towards his own servants, and his own children, and every body in his house; perceiving his own poverty the more forcibly by the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of others. And this is not the only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but that he also often envies him who has invited him to the feast, and returns home having received no benefit at all. But with regard to the house of mourning, nothing of this sort can be said. On the contrary, much spiritual wisdom is to be gained there, as well as sobriety. For when once a person has passed the threshold of a house which contains a corpse, and has seen the departed one lying speechless, and the wife tearing her hair, mangling her cheeks, and wounding her arms, he is subdued; his countenance becomes sad; and every one of those who sit down together can say to his neighbour but this, <q>We are nothing, and our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is inexpressible!</q>  What can be more full of wisdom than these words, when we both acknowledge the insignificance of our nature, and accuse our own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and account present things as nothing? Giving utterance, though in different words, to that very sentiment of Solomon&mdash; that sentiment which is so marvellous and pregnant with Divine wisdom&mdash; <q>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191622"><a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;1:2</a></span> He who enters the house of mourning, weeps immediately for the departed, even though he be an enemy. Do you see how much better that house is than the other? For there, though he be a friend, he envies; but here, though he be an enemy, he weeps. This is a thing which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires of us above all, that we should not insult over those who have occasioned us grief. And not only may we gather these advantages, but others also which are not less than these. For each one is also put in mind of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and of the fearful Tribunal; of the great Account, and of the Judgment; and although he may have been suffering a thousand <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> from others, and have a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for sadness at home, he will receive and take back with him the medicine for all these things. For reflecting that he himself, and all those who swell with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, will in a little while suffer the same thing; and that all present things, whether pleasant or painful, are transitory; he thus returns to his house, disburdened of all sadness and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, with a light and buoyant heart; and hence he will hereafter be more meek, and gentle, and benignant to all; as well as more wise; the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of things to come having made its way into his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and consumed all the thorns.</p>

<p>6. All this Solomon perceived when he said, <q>It is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of drinking.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191623"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse3">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:3</a></span> From the one grows listlessness, from the other an earnest anxiety. From the one, contempt; from the other, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which conducts us to the practice of every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. If <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> were not a good thing, Christ would not have expended such long and frequent discourses on the subject of punishment, and vengeance to come. Fear is nothing less than a wall, and a defence, and an impregnable tower. For indeed we stand in need of much defence, seeing that there are many ambushments on every side. Even as this same Solomon again says admonishingly, <q>Perceive that you go in the midst of snares, and that you walk on the battlements of cities.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191624"><a href="../bible/sir009.htm#verse13">Sirach&nbsp;9:13</a></span> Oh with how many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things is this saying pregnant! Yea, not less than the former! Let us then, write it, each of us, upon our minds, and carry it about ever in our memories, and we shall not easily commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Let us write it there, having first learned it with the utmost exactness. For he does not say, <q>Observe</q>  that you go in the midst of snares; but, <q>Perceive!</q> And for what reason did he say, <q>Discern?</q>  He tells us that the snare is concealed; for this is indeed a snare, when the destruction does not appear openly, and the injury is not manifest, which lies hidden on all sides. Therefore he says, <q>Perceive!</q> Thou needest much reflection and diligent scrutiny. For even as boys conceal traps with earth, so the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> covers up our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> with the pleasures of this life.</p>

<p>7. But <q>perceive;</q> scrutinizing diligently; and if any kind of gain falls in your way, look not only at the gain, but inspect it carefully, lest somewhere death and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> lurk within the gain; and should you perceive this, fly from it. Again, when some delight or pleasure may chance to present itself, look not only at the pleasure; but lest somewhere in the depth of the pleasure some iniquity should lie enveloped, search closely, and if you discover it, hasten away! And should any one counsel, or flatter, or cajole, or promise honours, or any other such thing whatever, let us make the closest investigation; and look at the matter on all sides, lest something pernicious, something perilous, should perchance befall us through this advice, or <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, or attention, and we run upon it hastily and unwittingly. For if there were only one or two snares, the precaution would be easy. But now, hear how Solomon speaks when he wishes to set forth the multitude of these; <q>Perceive that you go in the midst of snares;</q> he does not say, that you <q>go by</q> snares, but <q>in the midst</q> of snares. On either side are the pit-falls; on either side the deceits. One goes into the forum; one sees an enemy; one is inflamed by the bare sight of him! One sees a friend honoured; one is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>! One sees a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man; one despises and takes no notice of him! One sees a rich man; one envies him! One sees some one injuriously treated; one recoils in disgust! One sees some one acting injuriously; one is indignant! One sees a handsome <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and is caught! Do you see, beloved, how many snares there are? Therefore it is said, <q>Remember that you go in the midst of snares.</q> There are snares in the house, snares at the table, and snares in social intercourse. Very often a person unwittingly, in the confidence of friendship, gives utterance to some particular of those matters which ought not to be repeated again, and so great a peril is brought about, that the whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> is thereby ruined!</p>

<p>8. On every side then let us search closely into these matters. Often has a wife, often have children, often have friends, often have neighbours, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> a snare to the unheeding! And why, it is asked, are there so many snares? That we may not fly low, but seek the things that are above. For just as birds, as long as they cleave the upper air, are not easily caught; so also thou, as long as you look to things above, will not be easily captured, whether by a snare, or by any other device. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is a fowler. Soar, then, too high for his arrows.  The man who has mounted aloft will no longer admire any thing in the affairs of this life. But as when we have ascended to the top of the mountains, the city and its walls seem to us to be but small, and the men appear to us to be going along upon the earth like ants; so when you have ascended to the heights of spiritual wisdom, nothing upon the earth will be able to fascinate you; but every thing, yea even riches, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and whatever else there be of that kind, will appear insignificant when you regard heavenly things. According to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> all the glories of the present life appeared trifling, and more unprofitable than dead things. Hence his exclamation, <q>The world is crucified unto me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191628"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> Hence also his admonition, <q>Set your affections on things above.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191629"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse2">Colossians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> Above? What kinds of things do you speak of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>? Where the sun is, where the moon is? Nay, says he. But where then? Where <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are? Where archangels? Where the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>? Where the seraphim are? Nay, says he. But where then? <q>Where Christ sits at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>9. Let us <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> then, and let us think of this continually, that even as to the bird caught in the snare, wings are of no service, but he beats them about vainly, and to no purpose; so also to you there is no utility in your reasonings,  when once you are powerfully captivated by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, but struggle as much as you may, you are captured! For this reason wings are given to birds; that they may avoid snares. For this reason men have the power of thinking; that they may avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. What pardon then, or what excuse will be ours, when we become more senseless than the brutes? For the bird which has once been captured by the snare, yet afterwards escaped, and the deer which has fallen into the net, but has broken through it, are hard to be captured again with the like; since experience becomes a teacher of caution to every one. But we, though often snared in the same nets, fall into the same again; and though honoured with reason, we do not imitate the forethought and care of the irrational animals! Hence how often do we, from beholding a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, suffer a thousand <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; returning home, and entertaining an inordinate desire, and experiencing anguish for many days; yet, nevertheless, we are not made discreet; but when we have scarcely cured one wound, we again fall into the same mischief, and are caught by the same means; and for the sake of the brief pleasure of a glance, we sustain a kind of lengthened and continual torment. But if we learn constantly  to repeat to ourselves this saying,  we shall be kept from all these grievous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</p>

<p>10. The beauty of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the greatest snare. Or rather, not the beauty of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but unchastened gazing! For we should not accuse the objects, but ourselves, and our own carelessness. Nor should we say, Let there be no <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, but Let there be no adulteries. We should not say, Let there be no beauty, but Let there be no fornication. We should not say, Let there be no belly, but let there be no <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>; for the belly makes not the <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, but our negligence. We should not say, that it is because of eating and drinking that all these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> exist; for it is not because of this, but because of our carelessness and insatiableness. Thus the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> neither ate nor drank, and yet he fell! <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> ate and drank, and ascended up to heaven! How many do I hear say, Let there be no poverty! Therefore let us stop the mouths of those who murmur at such things. For it is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> to utter such complaints. To such then, let us say, Let there be no meanness of spirit. For poverty brings innumerable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things into our state of life, and without poverty riches would be unprofitable. Hence we should accuse neither the one nor the other of these; for poverty and riches are both alike weapons which will tend to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if we are willing. As then the courageous soldier, whichever weapon he takes, displays his own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so the unmanly and cowardly one is encumbered by either. And that you may learn that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, remember, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, the case of Job; who became both rich, and likewise poor, and handled both these weapons alike, and conquered in both. When he was rich, he said, <q>My door was open to every comer.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191632"><a href="../bible/job031.htm#verse32">Job&nbsp;31:32</a></span> But when he had become poor, <q>The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away. As it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unto the Lord, so has it come to pass.</q>  When he was rich, he showed much hospitality; when he was poor, much patience. And thou, then&mdash;are you rich? Display much bountifulness! Have you become poor? Show much endurance and patience! For neither is <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor poverty in itself; but these things, either of them, become so according to the free choice of those who make use of them. Let us school ourselves then to entertain no such opinions on these subjects; nor let us accuse the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> choice of men. Riches are not able to profit the little-minded: nor is poverty able ever to injure the magnanimous.</p>

<p>11. Let us then discern the snares, and walk far off from them! Let us discern the precipices, and not even approach them! This will be the foundation of our greatest safety not only to avoid things sinful, but those things which seem indeed to be indifferent, and yet are apt to make us stumble towards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For example; to laugh, to speak jocosely, does not seem an acknowledged <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but it leads to acknowledged <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Thus laughter often gives birth to foul discourse, and foul discourse to actions still more foul. Often from words and laughter proceed railing and insult; and from railing and insult, blows and wounds; and from blows and wounds, slaughter and <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. If, then, you would take good counsel for yourself, avoid not merely foul words, and foul <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, or blows, and wounds, and murders, but unseasonable laughter, itself, and the very language of banter; since these things have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the root of subsequent <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>Let no foolish talking nor jesting proceed out of your mouth.</q>  For although this seems to be a small thing in itself, it becomes, however, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of much mischief to us. Again, to live in luxury does not seem to be a manifest and admitted crime; but then it brings forth in us great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>&mdash;<a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, extortion, and rapine. For the prodigal and sumptuous liver, bestowing extravagant service upon the belly, is often compelled to steal, and to seize the property of others, and to use extortion and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. If, then, you avoid luxurious living, you remove the foundation of extortion, and rapine, and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and a thousand other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; cutting away the root of iniquity from its extremity. Hence <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, that <q>she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191635"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:6</a></span> Again, to go to the theatres, or to survey the horse-race, or to play at dice, does not seem, to most men, to be an admitted crime; but it introduces into our life an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> host of miseries. For spending time in the theatres produces fornication, intemperance, and every kind of impurity. The spectacle of the horse-race also brings about fightings, railings, blows, insults, and lasting enmities. And a passion for dice-playing has often caused <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, injuries, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, reproaches, and a thousand other things more fearful still.</p>

<p>12. Therefore, let us not only avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but those things too which seem to be indifferent, yet by degrees lead us into these misdeeds. He, indeed, who walks by the side of a precipice, even though he may not fall over, trembles; and very often he is overset by this same trembling, and falls to the bottom. So also he who does not avoid <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from afar, but walks near them, will live in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and will often fall into them. Besides, he who eagerly looks at strange beauties, although he may not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, has in so doing entertained <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; and has become already an adulterer according to the declaration of Christ; <span class="stiki" id="note191636"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> and often by this very <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> he is carried on to the actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Let us then withdraw ourselves far from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Do you wish to live soberly? Avoid not only <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, but also the licentious glance! Do you wish to be far removed from foul words? Avoid not only foul words, but also inordinate laughter, and every kind of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Do you wish to keep far from committing murders? Avoid railing too. Do you wish to keep aloof from <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>? Avoid luxury and sumptuous tables, and pluck up the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> by the roots.</p>

<p>13. The licentiousness of the tongue is a great snare, and needs a strong bridle. Therefore also some one says. <q>His own lips are a powerful snare to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and he is snared by the words of his own mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191637"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse2">Proverbs&nbsp;6:2</a></span> Above all the other members, then, let us control this; let us bridle it; and let us expel from the mouth railings, and contumelies, and foul and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> language, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> habit of oaths. For again our discourse has brought us to the same exhortation. But I had arranged with your charity, yesterday, that I would say no more concerning this precept, forasmuch as enough has been said upon it on all the foregoing days. But what is to become of me? I cannot bear to desist from this counsel, until I see that you have put it in practice; since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, when he says to the Galatians, <q>Henceforth let no man trouble me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191638"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> appears again to have met and addressed them.  Such are the paternal bowels; although they say they will depart, yet they depart not, until they see that their sons are chastened. Have ye heard today what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speaks to us concerning oaths; <q>I lifted up my eyes, and I saw,</q> says he, <q>and, behold, a flying sickle, the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits; and he said to me, What do you see? And I said, I see a flying sickle, twenty cubits in length, and ten cubits in breadth. It shall also enter into the house,</q> says he, <q>of every one that swears in my name, and shall remain  in the midst, and shall pull down the stones and the wood.</q>  What, forsooth, is this which is here spoken? And for what reason is it in the form of a <q>sickle,</q> and that a <q>flying sickle,</q> that vengeance is seen to pursue the swearers? In order that you may see that the judgment is inevitable, and the punishment not to be eluded. For from a flying sword some one might perchance be able to escape, but from a sickle, falling upon the neck, and acting in the place of a cord,  no one can escape. And when wings too are added, what further hope is there of safety? But on what account does it pull down the stones and the wood of the swearer's house? In order that the ruin may be a correction to all. For since it is necessary that the earth must hide the swearer when dead; the very sight of his ruined house, now become a heap, will be an admonition to all who pass by and observe it, not to venture on the like, lest they suffer the like; and it will be a lasting <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the departed. The sword is not so piercing as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>! The sabre is not so destructive as the stroke of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>! The swearer, although he seems to live, is already dead, and has received the fatal blow. And as the man who has received the halter,  before he has gone out of the city and come to the pit,  and seen the executioner standing over him, is dead from the time he passed the doors of the hall of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>: so also the swearer.</p>

<p>14. All this let us consider, and let us not put our brethren on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. What do you, O man? At the sacred table you exact an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and where Christ lies slain, there you slay your own brother. Robbers, indeed, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> on the highways; but you slay the son in the presence of the mother: committing a <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> more accursed than Cain himself; for he slew his brother in solitude and only with present death; but you slay your brother in the midst of the church, and that with the deathless death that is to come! For think you that the church was made for this purpose, that we might <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>? Yea, for this it was made, that we might <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>! Is the Table placed there, that we may make adjurations? It is placed there to this end, that we may loose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, not that we may bind them. But you, if you heed nothing else, reverence at least that book, which you reach forth in putting the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; and open the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, which you take in hand when you bid <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>; and when thou hear what Christ there declares concerning oaths, shudder and desist! What then does He there say concerning oaths? <q>But I say unto you, Swear not at all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191645"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;5:34</a></span> And do you convert the Law  which forbids swearing into an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Oh, what contempt! Oh, what outrage! For you do just the same thing as if any one should bid the lawgiver, who prohibits <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, become himself a party to the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Not so much do I lament and weep, when I hear that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are slain  upon the highway, as I groan, and shed tears, and am horrified, when I see any one coming near this Table, placing his hands upon it, and touching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and swearing! Are you in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, I ask, concerning money, and would you slay a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? What do you gain to match the injury you do to your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and to your neighbour? If you believe that the man is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, do not impose the obligation of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; but if you know him to be a liar, do not force him to commit <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>. <q>But that I may have a full assurance:</q> says one. Verily, when you have not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> him, then you will receive a good and full assurance. </p>

<p>15. For now, when you have returned home, you will be continually the prey of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, while reasoning thus with yourself; <q>Was it to no purpose, then, that I put him upon his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>? Was he not really <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjured</a>? Have I not become the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</q> But if you dost not put him upon his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, you will receive much consolation on returning home, rendering thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and saying, <q>Blessed be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that I restrained myself, and did not compel him to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> vainly, and to no purpose. Away with gold! Perish the money!</q> for that which specially gives us assurance is, that we did not transgress the law, nor compel another to do it. Consider, for Whose sake thou did not put any one on his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; and this will suffice you for refreshment and consolation. Often, indeed, when a fight takes place, we bear being insulted with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, and we say to the insulter, <q>What shall I do with you? Such an one hinders me, who is your patron; he keeps back my hands.</q> And this is sufficient to console us. So when you are about to put any one on his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, restrain yourself; and stop; and say to him who is about to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, <q>What shall I do with you? God has forbidden me to put any one on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. He now holds me back.</q> This suffices both for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the Lawgiver, and for your safety, and for keeping him in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> who is ready to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>. For when he sees that we are thus afraid to put others on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, much more will he himself be afraid to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> rashly. Would you say thus, your return to your own home would be with much fullness of assurance. Hear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, in His Commandments, that He may Himself hear you in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>! This word shall be written in heaven, and shall stand by you on the Day of Judgment, and shall discharge many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>16. This also let us consider not only with respect to an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, but to every thing. And when we are about to do any good action for God's sake, and it is found to bring loss with it, let us look not merely at the loss connected with the matter, but at the gain which we shall reap by doing it for God. That is to say, Hath any one insulted you? Bear it nobly! And you will do so, if you think not of the insult merely, but of the dignity of Him who commands you to bear it, and you bear it meekly. Have you given an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>? Think not of the outlay, but of the produce which arises from the outlay. Have you been mulcted of money? Give thanks, and regard not only the pain which is the result of the loss, but the gain which comes of thanksgiving. If we thus regulate ourselves, none of those heavy events which may befal us will give us pain; but from those things which may seem to be grievous, we shall be even gainers, and loss will be sweeter and more desired than <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, pain than pleasure, and mirth and insult than <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Thus all things adverse will turn to our gain. And here we shall enjoy much tranquillity, and there we shall attain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant that we may all be deemed worthy to obtain,  by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through Whom and with Whom, to the Father with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, dominion, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
