<h1>Homily 17 on Ephesians</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ephesians 4:32 and 5:1, 2 </p>

<p><q>And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you. Be therefore imitators of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as beloved children; and walk in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, even as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God for an odor of a sweet smell.</q></p>

<p>The events which are past have greater force than those which are yet to come, and appear to be both more wonderful and more convincing. And hence accordingly <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> founds his exhortation upon the things which have already been done for us, inasmuch as they, on Christ's account, have a greater force. For to say, <q>Forgive, and you shall be forgiven</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse14">Matthew 6:14</a></span>, and <q>if you forgive not, you shall in nowise be forgiven</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse15">Matthew 6:15</a></span>&mdash;this addressed to men of understanding, and men who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the things to come, is of great weight; but <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> appeals to the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> not by these arguments only, but also by things already done for us. In the former way we may escape punishment, whereas in this latter we may have our share of some positive good. Thou imitatest Christ. This alone is enough to recommend <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that it is <q>to imitate God.</q> This is a higher principle than the other, <q>for He makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good, and sends rain on the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew 5:45</a></span> Because he does not merely say that we are <q>imitating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> but that we do so in those things wherein we receive ourselves such benefits. He would have us cherish the tender heart of fathers towards each other. For by heart, here, is meant lovingkindness and compassion. For inasmuch as it cannot be that, being men, we shall avoid either giving pain or suffering it, he does the next thing, he devises a remedy&mdash;that we should forgive one another. And yet there is no comparison. For if you indeed should at this moment forgive any one, he will forgive you again in return; whereas to God you have neither given nor forgiven anything. And thou indeed art forgiving a fellow-servant; whereas God is forgiving a servant, and an enemy, and one that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> Him.</p>

<p><q>Even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> says he, <q>also in Christ forgave you.</q></p>

<p>And this, moreover, contains a high allusion. Not simply, he would say, has He forgiven us, and at no risk or cost, but at the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of His Son; for that He might forgive you, He <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> the Son; whereas thou, oftentimes, even when you see pardon to be both without risk and without cost, yet dost not grant it.</p>

<p><q>Be therefore imitators of God as beloved children; and walk in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, even as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us an <a href="../cathen/11215d.htm">offering</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God for an odor of a sweet smell.</q></p>

<p>That you may not then think it an act of necessity, hear how He says, that <q>He gave Himself up.</q> As your Master loved you, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thou your friend. Nay, but neither will you be able so to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; yet still do so as far as you are able. Oh, what can be more blessed than a sound like this! Tell me of royalty or whatever else you will, there is no comparison. Forgive another, and you are <q>imitating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> you are made like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is more our duty to forgive trespasses than debts of money; for if you forgive debts, you have not <q>imitated God</q>; whereas if you shall forgive trespasses, you are <q>imitating God.</q> And yet how shall you be able to say, <q>I am poor, and am not able to forgive it,</q> that is, a debt, when you forgive not that which you are able to forgive, that is, a trespass? And surely thou dost not deem that in this case there is any loss. Yea, is it not rather <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, is it not abundance, is it not a plentiful store?</p>

<p>And behold yet another and a nobler incitement: &mdash; <q>as beloved children,</q> says he. You have yet another cogent reason to imitate Him, not only in that you have received such good at His hands, but also in that you are called His children. And since not all children imitate their fathers, but those which are beloved, therefore he says, <q>as beloved children.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ver. 2</a>. <q>Walk in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> </p>

<p>Behold, here, the groundwork of all! So then where this is, there is no <q><a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, no clamor, no railing,</q> but all are done away. Accordingly he puts the chief point last. Whence were you made a child? Because you were forgiven. On the same ground on which you have had so vast a privilege vouch-safed you, on that selfsame ground forgive your neighbor. Tell me, I say, if you were in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and had ten thousand misdeeds to answer for, and some one were to bring you into the palace; or rather to pass over this argument, suppose thou were in a fever and in the agonies of death, and some one were to benefit you by some medicine, would you not value him more than all, yea and the very name of the medicine? For if we thus regard occasions and places by which we are benefited, even as our own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, much more shall we the things themselves. Be a lover then of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; for by this are you saved, by this have you been made a son. And if you shall have it in your power to save another, will you not use the same remedy, and give the advice to all, <q>Forgive, that you may be forgiven</q>? Thus to incite one another, were the part of grateful, of generous, and noble spirits.</p>

<p><q>Even as Christ also,</q> he adds, <q>loved you.</q></p>

<p>You are only sparing friends, He enemies. So then far greater is that boon which comes from our Master. For how in our case is the <q>even as</q> preserved. Surely it is clear that it will be, by our doing good to our enemies.</p>

<p><q>And gave Himself up for us an offering and a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to God for an odor of a sweet smell.</q></p>

<p>Do you see that to suffer for one's enemies is <q>a sweet-smelling savor,</q> and an <q>acceptable <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a></q>? And if you shall die, then will you be indeed a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. This it is to <q>imitate God.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse3">Ver. 3</a>. <q>But fornication, and all uncleanness or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, let it not even be named among you, as becomes <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q></p>

<p>He has spoken of the bitter passion, of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; he now comes to the lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: for that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is the lesser <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, hear how <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also in the law says, first, <q>You shall do no <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse13">Exodus 20:13</a></span>, which is the work of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and then, <q>You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse14">Exodus 20:14</a></span>, which is of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. For as <q>bitterness,</q> and <q>clamor,</q> and <q>all <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>,</q> and <q>railing,</q> and the like, are the works of the passionate man, so likewise are <q>fornication, uncleanness, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>,</q> those of the lustful; since <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and sensuality spring from the same passion.  But just as in the former case he took away <q>clamor</q> as being the vehicle of <q><a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>,</q> so now does he <q>filthy talking</q> and <q>jesting</q> as being the vehicle of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; for he proceeds,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse4">Ver. 4</a>. <q>Nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting; but rather giving of thanks.</q></p>

<p>Have no witticisms, no obscenities, either in word or in deed, and you will quench the flame&mdash; <q>let them not even be named,</q> says he, <q>among you,</q> that is, let them not anywhere even make their appearance. This he says also in writing to the Corinthians. <q>It is actually reported that there is fornication among you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 5:1</a></span>; as much as to say, Be all pure. For words are the way to acts. Then, that he may not appear a forbidding kind of person and austere, and a destroyer of playfulness, he goes on to add the reason, by saying, <q>which are not befitting,</q> which have nothing to do with us&mdash; <q>but rather giving of thanks.</q> What good is there in uttering a witticism? thou only raisest a laugh. Tell me, will the shoemaker ever busy himself about anything which does not belong to or <em>befit</em> his trade? Or will he purchase any tool of that kind? No, never. Because the things we do not need, are nothing to us.</p>

<p>Moral. Let there not be one idle word; for from idle words we fall also into foul words. The present is no season of loose merriment, but of mourning, of tribulation, and lamentation: and do you play the jester? What wrestler on entering the ring neglects the struggle with his adversary, and utters witticisms? The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> stands hard at hand, <q>he is going about roaring</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1 Peter 5:8</a></span> to catch you, he is moving everything, and turning everything against your life, and is scheming to force you from your retreat, he is grinding his teeth and bellowing, he is breathing fire against your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and do you sit uttering witticisms, and <q>talking folly,</q> and uttering things <q>which are not befitting.</q> Full nobly then will you be able to overcome him! We are in sport, beloved. Would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the life of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>? Listen to what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says. <q>By the space of three years I ceased not to admonish every one night and day with tears.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse31">Acts 20:31</a></span> And if so great was the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he exerted in behalf of them of Miletus and Ephesus, not making pleasant speeches, but introducing his admonition with tears, what should one say of the rest? But hearken again to what he says to the Corinthians. <q>Out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 2:4</a></span> And again, <q>Who is weak, and I am not weak?</q> <q>Who is made to stumble, and I burn not?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2 Corinthians 11:29</a></span> And hearken again to what he says elsewhere, desiring every day, as one might say, to depart out of the world. <q>For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 5:4</a></span>; and do you laugh and play? It is war-time, and are you handling the dancers' instruments? Look at the countenances of men in battle, their dark and contracted mien, their brow terrible and full of awe. Mark the stern eye, the heart eager and beating and throbbing, their spirit collected, and trembling and intensely anxious. All is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> order, all is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> discipline, all is silence in the camps of those who are arrayed against each other. They speak not, I do not say, an impertinent word, but they utter not a single sound. Now if they who have visible enemies, and who are in nowise injured by words, yet observe so great silence, do you who hast your warfare, and the chief of your warfare in words, do you leave this part naked and exposed? Or are you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that it is here that we are most beset with snares? Are you amusing and enjoying yourself, and uttering witticisms and raising a laugh, and regarding the matter as a mere nothing? How many <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuries</a>, how many injuries, how many filthy speeches have arisen from witticisms! <q>But no,</q> you will say, <q>pleasantries are not like this.</q> Yet hear how he excludes all kinds of jesting. It is a time now of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and fighting, of watch and guard, of arming and arraying ourselves. The time of laughter can have no place here; for that is of the world. Hear what Christ says: <q>The world shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, but you shall be sorrowful.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse20">John 16:20</a></span> Christ was crucified for your ills, and do you laugh? He was buffeted, and endured so great sufferings because of your calamity, and the tempest that had overtaken you; and do you play the reveler? And how will you not then rather provoke Him?</p>

<p>But since the matter appears to some to be one of indifference, which moreover is difficult to be guarded against, let us discuss this point a little, to show you how vast an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> it is. For indeed this is a work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to make us disregard things indifferent. First of all then, even if it were indifferent, not even in that case were it right to disregard it, when one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the greatest <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are both produced and increased by it, and that it oftentimes terminates in fornication. However, that it is not even indifferent is evident from hence. Let us see then whence it is produced. Or rather, let us see what sort of a person a saint ought to be:&mdash; gentle, meek, sorrowful, mournful, contrite. The man then who deals in jests is no saint. Nay, were he even a Greek, such an one would be scorned. These are things allowed to those only who are on the stage. Where filthiness is, there also is jesting; where unseasonable laughter is, there also is jesting. Hearken to what the Prophet says, <q>Serve the Lord in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with trembling.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa002.htm#verse11">Psalm 2:11</a></span> Jesting renders the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> soft and indolent. It excites the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> unduly, and often it teems with acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and creates <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. But what more? In fine, have you not come to be among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? Then <q>put away childish things.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 13:11</a></span> Why, you will not allow your own servant in the market place to speak an impertinent word: and do you then, who sayest you are a servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, go uttering your witticisms in the public square? It is well if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is <q>sober</q> be not stolen away; but one that is relaxed and dissolute, who cannot carry off? It will be its own murderer, and will stand in no need of the crafts or assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>But, moreover, in order to understand this, look too at the very name.  It means the versatile man, the man of all complexions, the unstable, the pliable, the man that can be anything and everything. But far is this from those who are servants to the Rock. Such a character quickly turns and changes; for he must needs mimic both gesture and speech, and laugh and gait, and everything, aye, and such an one is <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to invent jokes: for he needs this also. But far be this from a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, to play the buffoon. Farther, the man who plays the jester must of necessity incur the signal <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the objects of his random ridicule, whether they be present, or being absent hear of it.</p>

<p>If the thing is creditable, why is it left to mountebanks? What, do you make yourself a mountebank, and yet art not ashamed? Why is it ye permit not your gentlewomen to do so? Is it not that you set it down as a mark of an immodest, and not of a discreet character? Great are the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that dwell in a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> given to jesting; great is the ruin and desolation. Its consistency is broken, the building is decayed, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is banished, reverence is gone. A tongue you have, not that you may ridicule another man, but that you may give thanks unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Look at your merriment-makers,  as they are called, those buffoons. These are your jesters. Banish from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, I entreat you, this graceless accomplishment. It is the business of parasites, of mountebanks, of dancers, of harlots; far be it from a generous, far be it from a highborn <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, aye, far too even from slaves. If there be any one who has lost respect, if there be any vile person, that man is also a jester. To many indeed the thing appears to be even a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> calls for our sorrow. Just as <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> little by little drives headlong into fornication, so also does a turn for jesting. It seems to have a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> about it, yet there is nothing more graceless than this. For hear the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which says, <q>Before the thunder goes lightning, and before a shamefaced man shall go favor.</q>  Now there is nothing more shameless than the jester; so that his mouth is not full of favor, but of pain. Let us banish this custom from our tables. Yet are there some who teach it even to the poor! O monstrous! They make men in affliction play the jester. Why, where shall not this pest be found next? Already has it been brought into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself. Already has it laid hold of the very Scriptures. Need I say anything to prove the enormity of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? I am ashamed indeed, but still nevertheless I will speak; for I am desirous to show to what a length the mischief has advanced, that I may not appear to be trifling, or to be discoursing to you on some trifling subject; that even thus I may be enabled to withdraw you from this delusion. And let no one think that I am fabricating, but I will tell you what I have really heard. A certain person happened to be in company with one of those who <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves highly on their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> (now I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I shall excite a smile, but still I will say it notwithstanding); and when the platter was set before him, he said, <q>Take and eat, children, lest your belly be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>!</q>  And again, others say, <q>Woe unto you, Mammon, and to him that has you not;</q>  and many like enormities has jesting introduced; as when they say, <q>Now is there no nativity.</q>  And this I say to show the enormity of this base temper; for these are the expressions of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> destitute of all reverence. And are not these things enough to call down thunderbolts? And one might find many other such things which have been said by these men.</p>

<p>Wherefore, I entreat you, let us banish the custom universally, and speak those things which become us. Let not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mouths utter the words of dishonorable and base men. <q>For what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity, or what communion has light with darkness?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2 Corinthians 6:14</a></span> Happy will it be for us, if, having kept ourselves aloof from all such foul things, we be thus able to attain to the promised blessings; far indeed from dragging such a train after us, and sullying the purity of our minds by so many. For the man who will play the jester will soon go on to be a railer, and the railer will go on to heap ten thousand other mischiefs on himself.
