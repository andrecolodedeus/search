<h1>Homily 17 on First Timothy</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 6:2-7</a></strong></p>

<p> <em><q>These things teach and exhort. If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness; he is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, strife, railings, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> surmisings, perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw yourself. But godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</q></em></p>

<p>A teacher has need not only of authority, but of gentleness, and not only of gentleness, but of authority. And all these the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> teaches, at one time saying, <q>These things command and teach</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse11">1 Timothy 4:11</a></span>; at another, <q>These things teach and exhort.</q>  For if physicians entreat the sick, not for the benefit of their own health, but that they may relieve their sickness, and restore their prostrate strength, much more ought we to observe this method, of entreating those whom we teach. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> does not refuse to be their servant: <q>We preach not ourselves,</q> he says; <q>but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 4:5</a></span>; and again, <q>All things are yours, whether <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> or Apollos.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 3:12</a></span> And in this service he serves with alacrity, for it is not slavery, but superior to freedom. For He says, <q>Whoever commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse34">John 8:34</a></span></p>

<p><q>If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing.</q> Presumption therefore arises not from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but from <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing.</q> For he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the doctrines of godliness is also the most disposed to moderation. He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> sound words, is not unsound. For what inflammation is in the body, that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And as we do not in the first case say that the inflamed part is sound, so neither do we here consider the arrogant. It is possible then to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, and yet to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing. For he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what he ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing. And that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> arises from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing is manifest from hence. Christ <q>made Himself of no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a></span>, he therefore who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this will not be high-minded. Man has nothing except from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore he will not be high-minded. <q>For what have you that thou did not receive?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 4:7</a></span> He washed the feet of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, how can he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> this be setting himself up? Therefore He says, <q>When you have done all, say we are unprofitable servants.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse10">Luke 17:10</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> was accepted only from his humility, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> perished by his boastfulness. He who is puffed up <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> none of these things. Again, Christ Himself says, <q>If I have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but if well, why do you smite me?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse23">John 18:23</a></span></p>

<p><q>Doting  about questions.</q> To question then is to dote. <q>And strifes of words</q>; this is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> said. For when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is fevered with reasonings, and stormy, then it questions, but when it is in a sound state, it does not question, but receives the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But from questionings and strifes of words nothing can be discovered. For when the things which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only promises are received by an inquisitive spirit, it neither demonstrates them, nor suffers us to understand them. If one should close his eyes, he would not be able to find anything he sought: or if, again with his eyes open, he should bury himself, and exclude the sun, he would be unable to find anything, thus seeking. So without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nothing can be discerned, but contentions must needs arise. <q>Whereof come railings, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> surmisings</q>; that is, erroneous opinions and doctrines arising from questionings. For when we begin to question, then we surmise concerning God things that we ought not.</p>

<p><q>Perverse disputings,</q>  that is, leisure or conversation, or he may mean intercommunication, and that as infected sheep by contact  communicate disease to the sound, so do these bad men.</p>

<p><q>Destitute of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, thinking that gain is godliness.</q> Observe what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are produced by strifes of words. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of gain, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; for <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is engendered by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<p><q>From such withdraw yourself.</q> He does not say, engage and contend with them, but <q>withdraw yourself,</q> turn away from them; as elsewhere he says, <q>A man that is an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> after the first and second admonition reject.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus 3:10</a></span> He shows that they do not so much <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, as they owe their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to their indolence. Those who are contentious for the sake of money you will never persuade. They are only to be persuaded, so long as you give, and even so you will never satisfy their desires. For it is said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man's eye is not satisfied with a portion.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir014.htm#verse9">Sirach 14:9</a></span> From such then, as being incorrigible, it is right to turn away. And if he who had much obligation to fight for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is advised not to engage in contention with such men, much more should we  avoid it, who are in the situation of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<p>Having said, <q>They think that godliness is a means of gain,</q> he adds: <q>But godliness with contentment is great gain,</q> not when it possesses <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, but when it has it not. For that he may not despond on account of his poverty, he encourages and revives his spirit. They think, he says, that godliness is a means of gain,  and so it is; only not in their way, but in a much higher. Then having demolished theirs he extols the other. For that worldly gain is nothing, is manifest, because it is left behind, and does not attend us, or go along with us at our departure. Whence is this plain? Because we had nothing when we came into this world, therefore we shall have nothing when we depart from it. For nature came naked into the world, and naked she will go out of it. Therefore we want no superfluities; if we brought nothing with us, and shall take nothing away with us.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">Ver. 8</a>. <q>And having food and raiment, let us be therewith content.</q></p>

<p>Such things, and so much ought we to eat, as will suffice to nourish us, and such things should we put on, as will cover us, and clothe our nakedness, and nothing more; and a common garment will answer this purpose. Then he urges them from the consideration of things here, saying,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse9">Ver. 9</a>. <q>But they that will be rich</q>; not those that are rich, but those who wish to be. For a man may have money and make a good use of it, not overvaluing it, but bestowing it upon the poor. Such therefore he does not blame, but the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>.</p>

<p><q>They that will be rich fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</q></p>

<p>He has <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> said, <q>they drown men,</q> since they cannot be raised from that depth. <q>In destruction and perdition.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">Ver. 10</a>. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; which while some <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> after, they have erred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</q></p>

<p>Two things he mentions, and that which to them might seem the more weighty he places last, their <q>many sorrows.</q> And to learn how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> this is, the only way is to sojourn with the rich, to see how many are their sorrows, how bitter their complaints.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse11">Ver. 11</a>. <q>But you, O man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>This is a title of great dignity. For we are all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the righteous peculiarly so, not by right of creation only, but by that of appropriation.  If then you are a <q>man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> seek not superfluous things, which lead you not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but</p>

<p><q>Flee these things, and follow after righteousness.</q> Both expressions are emphatic; he does not say turn from one, and approach the other, but <q>flee these things, pursue righteousness,</q> so as not to be <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>.</p>

<p><q>Godliness,</q> that is, soundness in doctrines. </p>

<p><q>Faith,</q> which is opposed to questionings.</p>

<p><q>Love,</q> patience, meekness.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse12">Ver. 12</a>. <q>Fight the good fight of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, lay hold on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> Lo, there is your reward, <q>whereunto you are also called, and hast professed a good profession,</q> in hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, <q>before many witnesses.</q></p>

<p>That is, do not put that confidence to shame. Why do you labor to no profit? But what is the <q><a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and snare,</q> which he says, those that would be rich fall into? It causes them to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it involves them in dangers, it renders them less intrepid. <q>Foolish desires,</q> he says. And is it not a foolish desire, when men like to keep idiots and dwarfs, not from benevolent motives, but for their pleasure, when they have receptacles for fishes in their halls, when they bring up wild beasts, when they give their time to dogs, and dress up horses, and are as fond of them as of their children?  All these things are foolish and superfluous, nowise necessary, nowise useful.</p>

<p><q>Foolish and hurtful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>!</q> What are hurtful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>? When men live unlawfully, when they desire what is their neighbor's, when they do their utmost in  luxury, when they long for <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, when they desire the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and destruction of others. From these desires many have aimed at tyranny, and perished. Surely to labor with such views is both foolish and hurtful. And well has he said, <q>They have erred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> Covetousness attracting their eyes to herself, and gradually stealing away their minds, suffers them not to see their way. For as one walking on the straight road, with his mind intent on something else, proceeds on his way indeed, but, often without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it, passes by the very city to which he was hastening, his feet plying on at random and to no purpose: such like a thing is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. <q>They have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</q> Do you see what he means by that word <q>pierced</q>? What he means to express by the allusion  is this. Desires are thorns, and as when one touches thorns, he gores his hand, and gets him wounds, so he that falls into these <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> will be wounded by them, and pierce his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with griefs. And what cares and troubles attend those who are thus pierced, it is not possible to express. Therefore he says, <q>Flee these things, and follow after righteousness, godliness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, patience, meekness.</q> For meekness springs from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse12">Ver. 12</a>. <q>Fight the good fight.</q></p>

<p>Here he commends his boldness and manliness, that before all he confidently <q>made profession,</q> and he reminds him of his early instruction.</p>

<p><q>Lay hold on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q></p>

<p>There is need not only of profession, but of patience also to persevere in that profession, and of vehement contention, and of numberless toils, that you be not overthrown. For many are the stumbling-blocks, and impediments, therefore the way is <q>strait and narrow.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse14">Matthew 7:14</a></span> It is necessary therefore to be self-collected,  and well girt on every side. All around appear pleasures attracting the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Those of beauty, of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, of luxury, of indolence, of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, of revenge, of power, of dominion, and these are all fair and lovely in appearance, and able to captivate those who are unsteady, and who do not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has but a severe and uninviting countenance. And why? Because the pleasures that she promises are all future, whereas the others hold out present <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> and delights, and repose; though all are false and counterfeit. To these therefore adhere gross, effeminate, unmanly minds, indisposed to the toils of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. As in the games of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, he who does not earnestly <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the crown, may from the first give himself up to revellings and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and so do in fact the cowardly and unmanly combatants, while those who look steadfastly to the crown sustain blows without number. For they are supported and roused to action by the hope of future reward.</p>

<p> <em>Moral.</em> Let us then flee from this root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and we shall escape them all. <q>The <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>,</q> he says, <q>is the root;</q> thus says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, or rather Christ by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and let us see how this is. The actual experience of the world testifies it. For what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not caused by <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, or rather not by <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, but by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to use it? For it is possible to use <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> in well doing, and even through means of it to inherit the kingdom. But now what was given us for the relief of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, to make amends for our past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to win a good report, and to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this we employ against the poor and wretched, or rather against our own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and to the high displeasure of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For as for the other, a man robs him of his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and reduces him to poverty, but himself to death; and him he causes to pine in penury here, but himself in that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. Are they equal sufferers, think you?</p>

<p>What <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> then does it not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>! What fraudulent practices, what robberies! What miseries, enmities, contentions, battles! Does it not stretch forth its hand even to the dead, nay, to fathers, and brethren? Do not they who are possessed by this passion violate the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature, and the commandments of God? In short everything? Is it not this that renders our courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> necessary? Take away therefore the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, and you put an end to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, to battle, to enmity, to strife and contention. Such men ought therefore to be banished from the world, as wolves and pests. For as opposing and violent winds, sweeping over a calm sea, stir it up from its foundations, and mingle the sands of the deep with the waves above, so the lovers of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> confound and unsettle everything. The <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> a friend: a friend, did I say? He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not God Himself, driven mad, as he is, by the passion of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. Do you not see the Titans going forth sword in hand? This is a representation of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. But the lovers of money do not counterfeit, they are really mad, and beside themselves; and if you could lay bare their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, you would find them armed in this way not with one or two swords, but with thousands, acknowledging no one, but turning their rage against all; flying and snarling at all, slaughtering not dogs,  but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and uttering <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> against heaven itself. By these men all things are subverted, and ruined by their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> after <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>.</p>

<p>For whom indeed, whom I should accuse, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not! It is a plague that so seizes all, some more, some less, but all in a degree. Like a fire catching a wood, that desolates and destroys all around, this passion has laid waste the world. Kings, magistrates, private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, men, children, are all alike affected by it. As if a gross darkness had overspread the earth, no one is in his sober senses. Yet we hear, both in public and private, many declamations  against <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, but no one is mended by them.</p>

<p>What then is to be done? How shall we extinguish this flame? For though it has risen up to heaven itself, it is to be extinguished. We have only to be willing, and we shall be able to master the conflagration. For as by our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> it has got head, so it may be brought under by our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Did not our own choice <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it, and will not the same choice avail to extinguish it? Only let us be willing. But how shall that willingness be engendered? If we consider the vanity and the unprofitableness of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, that it cannot depart hence with us, that even here it forsakes us, and that while it remains behind, it inflicts upon us wounds that depart along with us. If we see that there are riches There, compared to which the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of this world is more despicable than dung. If we consider that it is attended with numberless dangers, with pleasure that is temporary, pleasure mingled with sorrow. If we contemplate aright the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, we shall be able to despise worldly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. If we remember that it profits nothing either to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or health, or any other thing; but on the contrary drowns men in destruction and perdition. If you consider that here you are rich, and hast many under you, but that when you depart hence, you will go naked and solitary. If we often represent  these things to ourselves, and listen to them from others, there will perhaps be a return to a sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and a deliverance from this dreadful punishment.</p>

<p>Is a pearl beautiful? Yet consider, it is but sea water, and was once cast away in the bosom of the deep. Are gold and silver beautiful? Yet they were and are but dust and ashes. Are silken vestments beautiful? Yet they are nothing but the spinning of worms. This beauty is but in opinion, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> prejudice, not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the things. For that which possesses beauty from nature, need not any to point it out. If you see a coin of brass that is but gilded over, you admire it at first, fancying that it is gold; but when the cheat is shown to you by one who understands it, your wonder vanishes with the deceit. The beauty therefore was not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing. Neither is it in silver; you may admire tin for silver, as you admired brass for gold, and you need some one to inform you what you should admire. Thus our eyes are not sufficient to discern the difference. It is not so with flowers, which are much more beautiful. If you see a rose, you need no one to inform you, you can of yourself distinguish an anemone, and a violet, or a lily, and every other flower. It is nothing therefore but prejudice. And to show, that this destructive passion is but a prejudice; tell me, if the Emperor were pleased to ordain that silver should be of more value than gold, would you not transfer your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and admiration to the former? Thus we are everywhere under the influence of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and opinion.  And that it is so, and that a thing is valued for its rarity, and not for its nature, appears hence. The fruits that are held cheap among us are in high esteem among the Cappadocians, and among the Serians  even more valuable than the most precious among us, from which country these garments are brought; and many such instances might be given in Arabia and India, where spices are produced, and where precious stones are found. Such preference therefore is nothing but prejudice, and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> opinion. We act not from judgment, but at random, and as accident determines. But let us recover from this intoxication, let us fix our view upon that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> beautiful, beautiful in its own nature, upon godliness and righteousness; that we may obtain the promised blessings, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, with whom, etc.</p>
