<h1>Homily 18 on Hebrews</h1>

<h2>Hebrews 10:8-13</h2>

<p><q> <em>Above when He said, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt-offerings, and [offering] for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, You would not, neither had pleasure [therein], which are offered by</em>  <em>the Law, then said He, Lo! I come to do Your will, O God. He takes away the first, that He may establish the second. By the which will we are</em>  <em>sanctified, by the offering of the body of</em> Jesus <em>Christ, once for all.</em>  <em> And every Priest stands daily ministering, and offering oftentimes the same <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, which can never take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But this [man] after He had offered one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for ever, sat down on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from henceforth expecting till His enemies be made His footstool.</em></q> </p>

<p>1. In what has gone before he had shown that the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were unavailing for perfect purification, and were a type, and greatly defective. Since then there was this objection to his argument, If they are types, how is it that, after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has come, they have not ceased, nor given place, but are still performed? He here accordingly labors at this very point, showing that they are no longer performed, even as a figure, for God does not accept them. And this again he shows not from the New [Testament], but from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, bringing forward from times of old the strongest testimony, that it [the old system] comes to an end, and ceases, and that they do all in vain, <q>alway resisting the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse51">Acts 7:51</a></span></p>

<p>And he shows over and above that they cease not now [only], but at the very coming of the Messiah, nay rather, even before His coming: and how it was that Christ did not abolish them at the last, but they were abolished first, and then He came; first they were made to cease, and then He appeared. That they might not say, Even without this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and by means of those, we could have been well pleasing unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He waited for these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to be convicted [of weakness], and then He appeared; for (He says) <q><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and offering You would not.</q> Hereby He took all away; and having spoken generally, He says also particularly, <q>In burnt-offerings and [<a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>] for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> You had no pleasure.</q> But <q>the offering</q> was everything except the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. <q>Then said I, Lo! I come.</q> Of whom was this spoken? Of none other than the Christ.</p>

<p>Here he does not blame those who offer, showing that it is not because of their wickednesses that He does not accept them, as He says elsewhere, but because the thing itself has been convicted for the future and shown to have no strength, nor any suitableness to the times.  What then has this to do with the <q><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a></q> being offered <q>oftentimes</q>? Not only from their being <q>oftentimes</q> [offered] (he means) is it manifest that they are weak, and that they effected nothing; but also from God's not accepting them, as being unprofitable and useless. And in another place it is said, <q>If You had desired <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> I would have given it.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse16">Psalm 51:16</a></span> Therefore by this also he makes it plain that He does not desire it. Therefore <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but the abolition of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. Wherefore they <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> contrary to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</p>

<p>What is <q>To do Your will</q>? To give up Myself, He means: This is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>By which Will we are sanctified.</q> Or he even means something still further, that the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> do not make men clean, but the Will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. And why do you wonder that it is not the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> now, when it was not His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> even from the beginning? For <q>who,</q> says He, <q>has required this at your hands?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse12">Isaiah 1:12</a></span></p>

<p>How then did He Himself enjoin it? In condescension. For as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>I would  that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as I myself</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 7:7</a></span>, in respect of continence, and again says, <q>I will  that the younger <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> marry, bear children</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 5:14</a></span>; and lays down two wills, yet the two are not his own, although he commands; but the one indeed is his own, and therefore he lays it down without reasons; while the other is not his own, though he wishes it, and therefore it is added with a reason. For having previously accused them, because <q>they had waxed wanton against Christ</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse11">1 Timothy 5:11</a></span>, he then says, <q>I will that the younger <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> marry, bear children.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 5:14</a></span> So in this place also it was not His leading will that the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> should be offered. For, as He says, <q>I wish not the death of the sinner, as that he should turn unto [Me] and live</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel 33:11</a></span>: and in another place He says that He not only wished, but even desired  this: and yet these are contrary to each other: for intense  wishing is desire. How then dost Thou <q>not wish</q>? How dost Thou in another place <q>desire,</q> which is a sign of vehement wishing? So is it in this case also.</p>

<p><q>By the which will we are sanctified,</q> he says. How sanctified? <q>by the offering of the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> once for all.</q></p>

<p>3. <q>And every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q> (To stand therefore is a sign of ministering; accordingly to sit, is a sign of being ministered unto.)</p>

<h2>Hebrews 10:14-15</h2>

<p><q>But this [man] after He had offered one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> for ever, sat down on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from henceforth expecting till His enemies be made His footstool.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse14">Hebrews 10:14-15</a></span> <q>For by one offering He has perfected forever them that are sanctified. Whereof the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to us.</q> He had said that those [<a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>] are not offered; he reasoned from what is written, [and] from what is not written;  moreover also he put forward the prophetic word which says, <q><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and offering You would not.</q> He had said that He had forgiven their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 10:16-18</h2>

<p>Again this also He proves from the testimony of what is written, for <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></q> (he says) <q>is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to us: for after that He had said,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse16">Hebrews 10:16-18</a></span> <q>This is the covenant, that I will make with them, after those days, says the Lord: I will put My <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and iniquities will I remember no more. Now where remission of these is there is no more offering for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> So then He forgave their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when He gave the Covenant, and He gave the Covenant by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. If therefore He forgave the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> through the one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, there is no longer need of a second.</p>

<p><q>He sat down on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from henceforth expecting.</q> Why the delay? <q>that His enemies be put under His feet. For by one offering He has perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</q> But perhaps some one might say; Wherefore did He not put them under at once? For the sake of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who should afterwards be brought forth and born. Whence then [does it appear] that they shall be put under? By the saying <q>He sat down.</q> He called to mind again that testimony which says, <q>until I put the enemies under His feet.</q> <span class="stiki">See <a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse13">Hebrews 1:13</a></span> But His enemies are the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Then since he had said, <q>Till His enemies be put under His feet,</q> and they [these enemies ] were vehemently urgent, therefore he introduces all his discourse concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> after this. But who are the enemies? All unbelievers: the d&aelig;mons. And intimating the greatness of their subjection, he said not <q>are subjected,</q> but <q>are put under His feet.</q></p>

<p>4. Let us not therefore be of [the number of] His enemies. For not they alone are enemies, the unbelievers and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but those also who are full of unclean living. <q>For the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for neither can it be.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse7">Romans 8:7</a></span> What then (you say)? This is not a ground of blame. Nay rather, it is very much a ground of blame. For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man as long as he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, cannot be subject [to God's law]; he can however change and become good.</p>

<p>Let us then cast out carnal minds. But what are carnal? Whatever makes the body flourish and do well, but injures the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: as for instance, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, luxury, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (all these things are of the flesh), carnal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Let us not then <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> gain, but ever follow after poverty: for this is a great good.</p>

<p>But (you say) it makes one <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and of little account. [True:] for we have need of this, for it benefits us much. <q>Poverty</q> (it is said) <q>humbles a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse4">Proverbs 10:4</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> And again Christ [says], <q>Blessed are the poor in spirit.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew 5:3</a></span> Do you then grieve because you are upon a path leading to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this gives us great confidence?</p>

<p>But, one says, <q>the wisdom of the poor man is despised.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse16">Ecclesiastes 9:16</a></span> And again another says, <q>Give me neither riches nor poverty</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse8">Proverbs 30:8</a></span>, and, <q>Deliver me from the furnace of poverty.</q>  <span class="stiki">See <a href="../bible/isa048.htm#verse10">Isaiah 48:10</a></span> And again, if riches and poverty are from the Lord, how can either poverty or riches be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Why then were these things said? They were said under  the Old [Covenant], where there was much account made of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, where there was great contempt of poverty, where the one was a curse and the other a blessing. But now it is no longer so.</p>

<p>But will you hear the praises of poverty? Christ sought after it, and says, <q>But the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> has not where to lay His head.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse20">Matthew 8:20</a></span> And again He said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Provide  neither gold, nor silver, nor two coats.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse9">Matthew 10:9-10</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in writing said, <q>As having nothing and yet possessing all things.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 6:10</a></span> And Peter said to him who was lame from his birth, <q>Silver and gold have I none.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse6">Acts 3:6</a></span> Yea and under the Old [Covenant] itself, where <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> was held in admiration, who were the admired?  Was not Elijah, who had nothing save the sheepskin? Was not Elisha? Was not John?</p>

<p>Let no man then be humiliated on account of his poverty: It is not poverty which humiliates, but <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, which compels us to have need of many, and forces us to be under <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to many?</p>

<p>And what could be poorer than Jacob (tell me), who said, <q>If the Lord give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse20">Genesis 28:20</a></span> Were Elijah and John then wanting in boldness?  Did not the one reprove Ahab, and the other <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>? The latter said, <q>It is not lawful for you to have your brother Philip's wife.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse18">Mark 6:18</a></span> And Elias said to Ahab with boldness, <q>It is not I that trouble <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but you and your father's house.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse18">1 Kings 18:18</a></span> You see that this especially produces boldness; poverty [I mean]? For while the rich man is a slave, being subject to loss, and in the power of every one wishing to do him hurt, he who has nothing, fears not confiscation, nor fine. So, if poverty had made men wanting in boldness Christ would not have sent His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with poverty to a work requiring great boldness. For the poor man is very strong, and has nothing wherefrom he may be wronged or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> entreated. But the rich man is assailable on every side: just in the same way as one would easily catch a man who was dragging many long ropes after him, whereas one could not readily lay hold on a naked man. So here also it falls out in the case of the rich man: slaves, gold, lands, affairs innumerable, innumerable cares, difficult circumstances, necessities, make him an easy prey to all.</p>

<p>5. Let no man then henceforth esteem poverty a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of disgrace. For if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be there, all the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of the world is neither clay, nor even a mote in comparison of it. This then let us follow after, if we would enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. For, He says, <q>Sell that you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall have treasure in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a></span> And again, <q>It is hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse23">Matthew 19:23</a></span> Do you see that even if we have it not, we ought to draw it to us? So great a good is Poverty. For it guides us by the hand, as it were, on the path which leads to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, it is an anointing for the combat, an exercise great and admirable, a tranquil haven.</p>

<p>But (you say) I have need of many [things], and am unwilling to receive a favor from any. Nevertheless, even in this respect the rich man is inferior to you; for thou perhaps ask the favor for your support, but he shamelessly [asks] for ten thousand things for <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness'</a> sake. So that it is the rich that are in need of many [<a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>], yea oftentimes those who are unworthy of them. For instance, they often stand in need of those who are in the rank of soldiers, or of slaves: but the poor man has no need even of the Emperor himself, and if he should need him, he is admired because he has brought himself down to this, when he might have been rich.</p>

<p>Let no man then accuse poverty as being the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of innumerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, nor let him contradict Christ, who declared it to be the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, saying, <q>If you will be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a></span> For this He both uttered in His words, and showed by His acts, and taught by His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Let us therefore follow after poverty, it is the greatest good to the sober-minded.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of those who hear me, avoid it as a thing of ill omen. I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> it.  For this disease is great among most men, and such is the tyranny of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, that they cannot even as far as words endure the renunciation of it, but avoid it as of ill omen. Far be this from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for nothing is richer than he who chooses poverty of his own accord, and with a ready mind.</p>

<p>6. How? I will tell you, and if you please, I will prove that he who chooses poverty of his own accord is richer even than the king himself. For he indeed needs many [things], and is in anxiety, and fears lest the supplies for the army should fail him; but the other has enough of everything, and fears about nothing, and if he fears, it is not about so great matters. Who then, tell me, is the rich man? He who is daily asking, and earnestly laboring to gather much together, and fears lest at any time he should fall short, or he who gathers nothing together, and is in great abundance and has need of no one? For it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not possessions which give confidence. For these even enslave. For it is said, <q>Gifts and presents blind the eyes of the wise, and like a muzzle on the mouth turn away reproofs.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir020.htm#verse29">Sirach 20:29</a></span></p>

<p>Consider how the poor man Peter chastised the rich Ananias. Was not the one rich and the other poor? But behold the one speaking with authority and saying, <q>Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse8">Acts 5:8</a></span>, and the other saying with submission, <q>Yea, for so much.</q> And who (you say) will grant to me to be as Peter? It is open to you to be as Peter if you will; cast away what you have. <q>Disperse, give to the poor</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa111.htm#verse9">Psalm 112:9</a></span>, follow Christ, and you shall be such as he. How? He (you say) wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Is it this then, tell me,  which made Peter an object of admiration, or the boldness which arose from his manner of life? Do you not hear Christ saying, <q>Rejoice not because the devils are subject unto you; If you will be perfect [&amp;c].</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse20">Luke 10:20</a></span> Hear what Peter says: <q>Silver and gold have I none, but what I have I give you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse6">Acts 3:6</a></span> If any man have silver and gold, he has not those other gifts.</p>

<p>Why is it then, you say, that many have neither the one nor the other? Because they are not voluntarily poor: since they who are voluntarily poor have all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. For although they do not raise up the dead nor the lame, yet, what is greater than all; they have confidence towards God. They will hear in that day that blessed voice, <q>Come, you blessed of My Father,</q> (what can be better than this?) <q>inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered and you gave Me meat: I was thirsty and you gave Me drink: I was a stranger and you took Me in: I was naked and you clothed Me: I was sick and in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> and you visited Me. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew 25:34-36</a></span> Let us then flee from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, that we may attain to the kingdom [of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>]. Let us feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, that we may feed Christ: that we may become fellow-heirs with Him in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, with whom to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, power, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and for ever and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
