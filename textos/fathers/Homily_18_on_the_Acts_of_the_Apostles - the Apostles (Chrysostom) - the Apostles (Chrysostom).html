<h1>Homily 18 on the Acts of the Apostles</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse54">Acts VII. 54</a></p>

<p>When they heard these things, they were cut to <q>the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</q></p>

<p>See,  once more, the wrong-doers in trouble. Just as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are perplexed, saying, <q>What are we to do with these men?</q> so these also are <q>cut to the heart.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse16">Acts 4:16</a></span> And yet it was he that had good right to be incensed, who, having done no wrong, was treated like a criminal, and was spitefully <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> had the worst of it in the end. So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is that saying, which I am ever repeating, <q>Ill to do, is ill to fare.</q> And yet he (in his charges against them) resorted to no <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, but <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (what he said). So sure are we, when we are shamefully borne down in a matter wherein we have a clear <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, to be none the worse for it.&mdash; <q>If  they desired,</q> say you, <q>to kill him, how was it that they did not take occasion, out of what he said, that they might kill him?</q> They would fain have a fair-seeming plea to put upon their outrage. <q>Well then, was not the insulting them a fair plea?</q> It was not his doing, if they were insulted: it was the Prophet's accusation of them. And besides, they did not wish it to look as if they killed him because of what he had said against them&mdash; just as they acted in the case of Christ; no, but for impiety: now  this word of his was the expression of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Wherefore, as they attempted, besides killing him, to hurt his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> also, <q>they were cut to the heart.</q> For they were afraid lest he should on the contrary become an object of even greater reverence. Therefore, just what they did in Christ's case, the same they do here also. For as He said, <q>You shall see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> sitting on the right hand of God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse64">Matthew 26:64</a></span>, and they, calling it <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, <q>ran upon Him;</q> just so was it here. There, they <q>rent their garments;</q> here, they <q>stopped their ears. But he, being full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Jesus standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said, Behold I see the heavens opened, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, and cast him out of the city, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse55">Acts 7:55-58</a></span> And yet, if he lied, they ought to have thought him beside himself, and to have let him go.&mdash; But he wished to bring them over, <q>and said, Behold,</q> etc., for, since he had spoken of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> death, and had said nothing of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, he would fain add this doctrine also. <q>Standing at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And in this manner He appeared to him:  that, were it but so, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> might receive Him: for since the (idea of His) sitting (at the right hand of God) was offensive to them, for the present he brings forward only what relates to His Resurrection. This is the reason also why his face was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being merciful, desired to make their machinations the means of recalling them unto Himself. And see, how many signs are wrought! <q>And cast him out of the city, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him.</q> Here again, <q>without the city,</q> and even in death, Confession and Preaching. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse21">Hebrews 13:21</a></span> <q>And the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul. And they <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> Stephen, calling  upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse59">Acts 7:59</a></span> This is meant to show them that he is not perishing, and to teach them. <q>And he knelt down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse60">Acts 7:60</a></span> To clear himself, and show that neither were his former words prompted by passion, he says, <q>Lord</q> <q>lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge</q>: wishing also even in this way to win them over. For to show that he forgave their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and rage in murdering him, and that his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was free from all passion, was the way to make his saying to be favorably received.</p>

<p><q>And Saul was consenting unto his death.</q> Hereupon arises a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and it becomes a great one. <q>And at that time there was a great <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which was at Jerusalem. And they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, except the Apostles.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse1">Acts 8:1</a></span> Mark how once more God permits <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> to arise; mark, and well observe, how the events are ordered by <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>. They were admired because of the signs: being scourged, they were none the worse for it: (some) were ordained in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> : the word increased: once more, God permits a great hindrance to arise. And a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of no ordinary kind [<q>and they were all scattered,</q> etc.]; for they feared their enemies, now become more daring: and at the same time it is shown that they were but men, these that were afraid, that fled. For, that you may not say after these things that  by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> alone they effected (what they did), they were also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and themselves became more timorous, while their adversaries were more daring. <q>And were all scattered abroad,</q> it says, <q>except the Apostles.</q> But this was divinely ordered, so that they should no longer all sit there in Jerusalem. <q>And devout men,</q> it says, <q>carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse2">Acts 8:2</a></span> If they were <q>devout,</q> why did they <q>make great lamentation over him?</q> They were not yet perfect. The man was gracious and amiable: this also shows that they were men&mdash; not their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> alone, but their grief and lamentation. Who would not have wept to see that mild, that lamb-like person <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, and lying dead?  Fit eulogy to be spoken over his grave has the Evangelist recorded, in this one speech, <q>Lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge.</q>&mdash; <q>And made,</q> he says, <q>great lamentation over him.</q>&mdash; But let us look over again what has been said.</p>

<p>He  mentions the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his (angelic) appearance <span class="stiki">Recapitulation, 7:54; 8:2</span>; <q>But he, being full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Jesus standing on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And when he said, <q>I see the heavens opened, they stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 56, 57.) And yet in what respect are these things deserving of accusation? <q>Upon him,</q> the man who has wrought such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, the man who has prevailed over all in speech, the man who can hold such discourse! As if they had got the very thing they wanted, they straightway give full scope to their rage. <q>And the witnesses,</q> he says, <q>laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man, whose name was Saul.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse58">Acts 7:58</a></span> Observe how particularly he relates what concerns <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, to show you that the Power which wrought in him was of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But after all these things, not only did he not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but also aimed at Him with a thousand hands: for this is why it says, <q>And Saul was consenting unto his death.</q>&mdash; And this blessed man does not simply <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but does it with earnestness: <q>having kneeled down.</q> Mark his divine death! So long  only the Lord permitted the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to remain in him. <q>And having said this, he fell asleep.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse60">Acts 7:60</a></span>&mdash; And they were all scattered abroad throughout the region of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse1">Acts 8:1</a></span> And now without scruple they had intercourse with <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, whereas it had been said to them, <q>Go not into the way of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a></q> <q>and into any city of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> enter ye not.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse5">Matthew 10:5</a></span> <q>Except the Apostles,</q> it says: they, in this way also, wishing to win the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash;but not to leave the city&mdash;and to be the means of inspiring others with boldness.</p>

<p><q>As for Saul, he made havoc of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, entering into every house, and haling men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> committed them to <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse3">Acts 8:3</a></span> Great was his frenzy: that he was alone, that he even entered into houses: for indeed he was ready to give his life for the Law. <q>Haling,</q> it says, <q>men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>:</q> mark both the confidence, and the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and the frenzy. All that fell into his hands, he put to all manner of ill-treatment: for in consequence of the recent <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, he was become more daring. <q>Therefore they that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word. Then Philip went down to the city of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and preached Christ unto them. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which he did. For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. And there was great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in that city. But there was a certain man, called Simon, which before time in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse4">Acts 8:4-9</a></span> Observe  another trial, this affair of Simon. <q>Giving out,</q> it says, <q>that he was himself some great one. To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. But when they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Philip preaching the things concerning the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, and the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Then Simon himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> also: and when he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and signs which were done. Now when the Apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> had received the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they sent unto them Peter and John: who, when they had come down, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them, that they might receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse10">Acts 8:10-15</a></span> And (yet) great signs had been done: how then had they not received the Spirit? They had received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, namely, of remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> they had not received. <q>For as yet He was fallen upon none of them: only they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 16, 17.) For, to show that this was the case, and that it was the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> they had not received, observe how, having seen the result, Simon came and asked for this. <q>And when Simon saw that through laying on of the Apostles' hands the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given, he offered them money, saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 18, 19.)</p>

<p><q>The  <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>,</q> say you, <q>gained strength.</q> True, but at that very time to men possessed before (by a hostile power) it brought deliverance. For it planted the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> like a stronghold, in the heart of the enemy's country.&mdash; Not even the death of Stephen quenched their rage, nay, increased it rather: it scattered wide the teachers, so that the greater became the discipleship.&mdash; <q>And there was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q> And yet there had been <q>great lamentation:</q> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but mark again the good&mdash; <q>Of a long time</q> was the malady, but this man brought them deliverance.&mdash; And how came he to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> Simon also? Just as Christ chose Judas.&mdash; And <q>beholding the signs</q> which he did, forasmuch as the others did not receive the (power of working) signs, he dared not ask for it.&mdash; How was it then that they did not strike him dead, as they did Ananias and Sapphira? Because even in the old times, he that gathered sticks (on the sabbath-day) was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> as a warning to others <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/num015.htm#verse32">Numbers 15:32</a></span> and in no other instance did any suffer the same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. So too on the present occasion, <q>Peter said to him, Your money perish, because you have imagined that the gift of God is to be purchased with money.</q>&mdash; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse20">Acts 8:20</a></span> Why had not these received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? Either because Philip kept this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> for the Apostles; or, because he had not this gift (to impart); or, he was one of the Seven: which is rather to be said. Whence, I take it, this Philip was one of the Apostles.  But observe; those went not forth: it was Providentially ordered that these should go forth and those be lacking, because of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: for they had received power to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but not also to impart the Spirit to others: this was the prerogative of the Apostles. And observe (how they sent) the chief ones: not any others, but Peter [and John ]. <q>And when Simon,</q> it says, <q>saw that through laying on of the Apostles' hands the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was given.</q> He would not have said, <q>And having seen,</q>  unless there had been some sensible manifestation.  <q>Then laid they their hands on them,</q> etc. Just as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also did, when they spoke with tongues. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse6">Acts 19:6</a></span> Observe the execrable conduct of Simon. <q>He offered money,</q> with what object? And yet he did not see Peter doing this for money. And it was not of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that he acted thus; it was because he would tempt them, because he wished to get matter of accusation against them. And therefore also Peter says, You have no part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God <q>because you have thought,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse21">Acts 8:21</a></span> Once more he brings to light what was in the thoughts, because Simon thought to escape detection. <q>Repent therefore of this your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you. For I perceive the bond of inquity. Then answered Simon, and said, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come upon me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse22">Acts 8:22-24</a></span> Even this  he did only formally, as words of course, when he ought to have wept and mourned as a penitent. <q>If perchance it may be forgiven you.</q> Not as though it would not have been pardoned, had he wept, but this is the manner of the Prophet also, to denounce absolutely, (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>) and not to say, <q>Howbeit, if you do this, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall be forgiven,</q> but that in any wise the punishment shall take effect.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <q>Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went everywhere, preaching the word.</q> But  I would have you admire how even in a season of calamity they neglected not the preaching. <q>Hearing and seeing the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which he did.</q> <span class="stiki">Recapitulation, <a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse4">Acts 8:4-6</a></span> Just as in the case of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by contrast (with the magicians) the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were evident <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, so here also. There was magic, and so these signs were manifest. (<em>b</em>) <q>For unclean spirits came out of many that were possessed with them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse7">Acts 8:7</a></span>; for this was a manifest <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>:&mdash; not as the magicians did: for the other (Simon), it is likely, bound (men with spells)&mdash;<q>and many,</q> it says, <q>that were palsied and lame were healed.</q> There was no deceit here: for it needed but that they should walk and work. <q>And to him they all gave heed, saying, This (man) is the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse10">Acts 8:10</a></span> And that was fulfilled which was spoken by Christ, <q>There shall come false Christs and false Prophets in My name.</q>&mdash; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew 24:24</a></span> <q>And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse11">Acts 8:11</a></span> (<em>a</em>) And yet there ought to have been not one <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a> there, seeing that of a long time he had been bewitching them with sorceries: but if there were many <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>, many palsied, these pretences were not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But Philip here by his word also won them over, discoursing concerning the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse12">Acts 8:12</a></span> <q>And Simon,</q> it says, being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, continued with Philip <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse13">Acts 8:13</a></span>: not for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith's</a> sake, but in order that he might become such (as he). (<em>b</em>) But why did they not correct him instantly? They were content with his condemning himself. For this too belonged to their work of teaching (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F25;&#x03C2; &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>). But  when he had not power to resist, he plays the hypocrite, just as did the magicians, who said, <q>This is the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And indeed that he might not be driven away again, therefore he <q>continued with Philip,</q> and did not part from him. <q>And when the Apostles which were at Jerusalem,</q> etc. (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 13, 14.) See how many things are brought about by God's Providence through the death of Stephen! (<em>a</em>) <q>But they,</q> it says, <q>having come down, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them that they might receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: for as yet He was fallen upon none of them. Then laid they their hands upon them, and they received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse15">Acts 8:15-17</a></span> Do you see that it was not to be done in any ordinary manner, but it needed great power to give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? For it is not all one, to obtain remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to receive such a power. (<em>b</em>) By degrees it is, that those receive the gift. It was a twofold sign: both the giving to those, and the not giving to this man.  Whereas then this man ought, on the contrary, to have asked to receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he, because he cared not for this, asks power to give It to others. And yet those received not this power to give: but this man wished to be more illustrious than Philip, he being among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>! (<em>a</em>) <q>He offered them money.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 18, 19.) What? Had he seen the others doing this? Had he seen Philip? Did he <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with what mind he came to them? (<em>b</em>) <q>Your money with you to perdition</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse20">Acts 8:20</a></span>: since you have not used it as it ought to be used. These are not words of imprecation, but of chastisement. <q>To you,</q> he says, be it (to you): being such. As if one should say, Let it perish along with your purpose. Have you so mean conceptions of the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you have imagined it to be altogether a thing of man? It is not this. (<em>a</em>) Wherefore also Peter well calls the affair a gift: <q>You have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</q> Do you observe how on all occasions they are clean from money? <q>For your heart is not right in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse21">Acts 8:21</a></span> Do you see how he does all of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>? To be simple, however, was the thing needed. (<em>b</em>) For had it been done with simplicity,  he would have even welcomed his willing mind. Do you see that to have mean conceptions of great things is to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> doubly? Accordingly, two things he bids him: <q>Repent and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, if haply the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse22">Acts 8:22</a></span> Do you see it was a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thought he had entertained? Therefore he says, <q>If haply it may be forgiven you:</q> because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him to be incorrigible. (<em>a</em>) <q>For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse23">Acts 8:23</a></span> Words of exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>! But otherwise he did not punish him: that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may not thereafter be of compulsion; that the matter may not seem to be carried ruthlessly; that he may introduce the subject of repentance: or also, because it suffices for correction to have convicted him, to have told him what was in his heart, to have brought him to confess himself overcome (<span class="greek">&#x1F45;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B9; &#x1F10;&amp; 128<!--k29--&#183;&#x03BB;&#x03C9;</span>). For that he says, <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">Pray</a> ye for me,</q> is a confession that he has done wrong. Observe him,  what a miscreant he is; when he was convicted, then he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: when again he was convicted, then he became <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.  <q>Seeing  his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>,</q> [<q>he was amazed,</q> and came over.] He thought to be able to escape detection: he thought the thing was an art: but when he had not power to defeat (<span class="greek">&#x1F11;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x1F35;&#x03BD;</span>) the Apostles, * * *. (<em>b</em>) Again, he fears the multitude, and is afraid to deny it; and yet he might have said, I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: I did it in simplicity: but he was struck with dismay first by the former circumstance, that he was overcome (<span class="greek">&#x1F45;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B9; &#x1F10;&amp; 128<!--k29--&#183;&#x03BB;&#x03C9;</span>), by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and secondly by this, that his thoughts are made manifest. Therefore he now takes himself a long wayoff, to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, thinking the Apostle would not soon come there.</p>

<p>And they, when they had testified, and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse25">Acts 8:25</a></span> <q>Testified,</q> probably because of him (Simon), that they may not be deceived; that thenceforth they may be safe. <q>Having preached,</q> it says, <q>the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem.</q> Why do they go there again where was the tyranny of the bad, where were those most bent upon killing them? Just as generals do in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, they occupy that part of the scene of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which is most distressed. <q>And preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in many villages of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>.</q> Observe them again, how they do not (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B7;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>) of set purpose come to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, but driven by stress of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, just as it was in the case of Christ; and how when the Apostles go there, it is to men now <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, no longer <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>. <q>But when the Apostles,</q> it says, <q>which were at Jerusalem heard this, they sent unto them Peter and John. Sent</q> them, again, to rid them of magic. And  besides, (the Lord) had given them a pattern at the time when the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. <q>And in many villages,</q> it says, <q>of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, they preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse39">John 4:39</a></span> Observe how actively employed even their journeys were, how they do nothing without a purpose. </p>

<p>Such travels should we also make. And why do I speak of travels? Many possess villages and lands, and give themselves no concern, nor make any account of this. That baths may be provided, their revenues increased, courts and buildings erected, for this they take plenty of pains: but for the husbandry of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, not so. When you see thorns&mdash; answer me&mdash; you cut them up, you burn, you utterly destroy them, to rid your land of the hurt thence arising. And do you see the laborers themselves overrun with thorns, and dost not cut them up, and are you not afraid of the Owner Who shall call you to account? For ought not each individual believer to build a Church, to get a Teacher, to cooperate (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;<!--k29--&#183; &#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) (with him), to make this above all his object, that all may be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Say, how is it likely your laborer should be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, when he sees you so regardless of his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? You can not work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and so convert (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x1FD6;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) him. By the means which are in your power, convert him; by kindness, by good offices, by gentleness, by courting (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&amp; 139<!--k29--&#183;</span>) him, by all other means. Market-places, indeed, and baths, the most do provide; but no Churches: nay, sooner everything than this! Wherefore I beseech and implore, as a favor I entreat, yea as a law I lay it down, that there be no estate to be seen destitute of a Church.  Tell not me, There is one hard by; there is one in the neighboring properties; the expense is great, the income not great. If you have anything to expend upon the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, expend it there: better there than here. Maintain a Teacher, maintain a Deacon, and a sacerdotal body complete. As by a bride, whether a wife whom you take, or a daughter whom you give in marriage,  so act by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: give her a dowry. So shall your estate be filled with blessing. For what shall not be there of all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>? Is it a small thing, tell me, that your wine-press should be blessed;  a small thing, tell me, that of your fruits God is the first to taste, and that the first fruits are there (with Him)? And then even for the peace of the laboring people this is profitable. Then as one whom they must respect, there will be the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> among them and this will contribute to the security of the estate. There will be constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> there through you  (<em>infra</em>, note 1, p. 119) <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and Communions through you; the Oblation on each <a href="../cathen/14335a.htm">Lord's Day</a>. For only consider what a praise it will be, that, whereas others have built splendid tombs, to have it said hereafter: <q>Such a one built this,</q> you have reared Churches! Bethink you that even until the coming of Christ you shall have your reward, who hast reared up the altars of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Suppose an Emperor had ordered you to build an house that he might lodge there, would you not have done everything to please him? And here now it is palace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which you build. Look not at the cost, but calculate the profit. Your people yonder cultivate your field: cultivate thou their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: they bring to you your fruits, raise thou them to heaven. He that makes the beginning is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all the rest: and you will be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the people are brought under <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>) both there, and in the neighboring estates. Your baths do but make the peasants less hardy, your taverns give them a taste for luxury, and yet you provide these for credit's sake. Your markets and fairs, (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03B3;&#x1F7B;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) on the other hand, promote  <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. But think now what a thing it would be to see a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, the moving picture of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, gray-headed, girded up, digging and working with his own hands? What more pleasant than such a field! Their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> thrives. No intemperance there, nay, it is driven away: no <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and wantonness, nay, it is cast out: no vanity, nay, it is extinguished. All benevolent tempers shine out the brighter through the simplicity of manners. How pleasant to go forth and enter into the House of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that one built it himself: to fling himself on his back in his litter, and  after the bodily benefit of his pleasant airing, be present both at the evening and the morning <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, have the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> as a guest at his table, in associating with him enjoy his benediction, see others also coming there! This is a wall for his field, this its security. This is the field of which it is said, <q>The smell of a full field which the Lord has blessed.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen027.htm#verse27">Genesis 27:27</a></span> If, even without this, the country is pleasant, because it is so quiet, so free from distraction of business, what will it not be when this is added to it? The country with a Church is like the Paradise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. No clamor there, no turmoil, no enemies at variance, no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>: there you shall see all friends, holding the same doctrines in common. The very quiet shall lead you to higher views, and receiving you thus prepared by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> shall give you an excellent cure. For here, whatever we may speak, the noise of the market drives it all out: but there, what you shall hear, you will keep fixed in your mind. You will be quite another man in the country through him: and moreover to the people there he will be director, he will watch over them both by his presence and by his influence in forming their manners. And what, I ask, would be the cost? Make for a beginning a small house (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1F71;&#x03BE;&#x03B5;&#x03B9; &#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03BF;&#x1F55;</span>) to serve as temple. Your successor will build a porch, his successor will make other additions, and the whole shall be put to your account. You give little, and receive   the reward for the whole. At any rate, make a beginning: lay a foundation. Exhort one another, vie one with another in this matter. But now, where there is straw and grain and such like to be stored, you make no difficulty of building: but for a place where the fruits of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> may be gathered in, we bestow not a thought; and the people are forced to go miles and miles, and to make long journeys, that they may get to Church! Think, how good it is, when with all quietness the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> presents himself in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that he may draw near unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and say <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the village, day by day, and for its owner! Say, is it a small matter, that even in the Holy Oblations evermore your name is included in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and that for the village day by day <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are made unto God?&mdash; How greatly this profits you for all else! It chances  that certain (great) <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> dwell in the neighborhood, and have overseers: now to you, being poor, one of them will not deign even to pay a visit: but the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, it is likely, he will invite, and make him sit at his table. How much good results from this! The village will in the first place be free from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suspicion. None will charge it with <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, with theft: none will suspect anything of the kind.&mdash; They have also another comfort, if sickness befall, if death.&mdash; Then again the friendships formed there by people as they go side by side (to and from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>) are not struck up at random and promiscuously: and the meetings there are far more pleasant than those which take place in marts and fairs. The people themselves also will be more respectable, because of their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. How is it you hear that Jerusalem was had in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> in the old times above all other cities? Why was this? Because of the then prevailing religion. Therefore it is that where God is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, there is nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: as, on the contrary, where He is not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, there is nothing good. It will be great security both with God and with men. Only, I beseech you, that you be not remiss: only may you put your hand to this work. For if he who brings out <q>the precious from the vile,</q> shall be <q>as the mouth of God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse19">Jeremiah 15:19</a></span>; he who benefits and recovers so many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, both that now are and that shall be even until the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, what favor shall not that person reap from God! Raise thou a garrison against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: for that is what the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is. Thence as from headquarters let the hands go forth to work: first let the people hold them up for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and then go their way to work. So shall there be vigor of body; so shall the tillage be abundant; so shall all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be kept aloof. It is not possible to represent in words the pleasure thence arising, until it be realized. Look not to this, that it brings in no revenue: if  thou do it at all in this spirit, then do it not at all; if you account not the revenue you get thence greater than from the whole estate beside; if you be not thus affected, then let it alone; if you do not account this work to stand you more in stead than any work beside. What can be greater than this revenue, the gathering in of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> into the threshing-floor which is in heaven! Alas, that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how much it is, to gain <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>! Hear what Christ says to Peter, <q>Feed My sheep.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse15">John 21:15-17</a></span> If, seeing the emperor's sheep, or herd of horses, by reason of having no fold or stable, exposed to depredation, thou were to take them in hand, and build a fold or stables, or also provide a shepherd or herdsman to take charge of them, what would not the emperor do for you in return? Now, you gather the flock of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and puttest a shepherd over them, and do you think it is no great gain you are earning? But, if for offending even one, a man shall incur so great a punishment, how can he that saves so many, ever be punished? What <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> will he have thenceforth? For, though he have it, does not this blot it out? From the punishment threatened to him that offends, learn the reward of him that saves. Were not the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of even one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> a matter of great importance, to offend would not move God to so great <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> these things, let us apply ourselves immediately to this spiritual work. And let each invite me, and we will together help to the best of our ability. If there be three joint-owners, let them do it by each bearing his part: if but one, he will induce the others also that are near. Only be earnest to effect this, I beseech you, that in every way being well-pleasing unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we may attain unto the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessings, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> with Whom to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> together be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, dominion, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and ever world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
