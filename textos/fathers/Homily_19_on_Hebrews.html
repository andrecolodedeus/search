<h1>Homily 19 on Hebrews</h1>

<h2>Hebrews 10:19-23</h2>

<p> <q>Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, by a new and living way which He has <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>  for us, through the Veil, that is to say, His flesh, and having an High Priest  over the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us draw near with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart, in full assurance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, having our hearts sprinkled from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession  of our hope without wavering.</q></p>

<p>1. <q> Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, by a new and living way which He has <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for us.</q> Having shown the difference of the High Priest, and of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and of the tabernacle, and of the Covenant, and of the promise, and that the difference is great, since those are temporal, but these <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, those <q>near to vanishing away,</q> these permanent, those powerless, these perfect, those figures, these reality, for (he says) <q>not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse16">Hebrews 7:16</a></span> And <q>You are a Priest for ever.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse6">Hebrews 5:6</a></span> Behold the continuance of the Priest. And concerning the Covenant, That (he says) is old (for <q>that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb008.htm#verse13">Hebrews 8:13</a></span>), but this is new; and has remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, while that [has] nothing of the kind: for (he says) <q>the Law made nothing perfect.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb007.htm#verse19">Hebrews 7:19</a></span> And again, <q><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and offering You would not.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse5">Hebrews 10:5</a></span> That is made with hands, while this is <q>not made with hands</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse11">Hebrews 9:11</a></span>: that <q>has the blood of goats</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse12">Hebrews 9:12</a></span>, this of the Lord; that has the Priest <q>standing,</q> this <q>sitting.</q> Since therefore all those are inferior and these greater, therefore he says, <q>Having therefore, brethren, boldness.</q></p>

<p>2. <q>Boldness</q>: from whence? As <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (he means) produce shame, so the having all things forgiven us, and being made fellow-heirs, and enjoying so great Love, [produces] boldness.</p>

<p><q>For the entrance into the holiest.</q> What does he mean here by <q>entrance</q>? <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and the access to spiritual things.</p>

<p><q>Which he has inaugurated,</q>  that is, which He prepared, and which He began; for the beginning of using is thenceforth called the inaugurating; which He prepared (he means) and by which He Himself passed.</p>

<p><q>A new and living way.</q> Here He expresses <q>the full assurance of hope.</q> <q>New,</q> he says. He is anxious to show that we have all things greater; since now the gates of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> have been opened, which was not done even for <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. <q>A new and living way,</q> he says, for the first was a way of death, leading to Hades, but this of life. And yet he did not say, <q>of life,</q> but called it <q>living,</q> (the ordinances, that is,) that which abides. </p> 

<p><q>Through the veil</q> (he says) <q>of His flesh.</q> For this flesh first cut that way, by this He inaugurated it [the way] by which He walked. And with good reason did he call [the flesh] <q>a veil.</q>  For when it was lifted up on high, then the things in heaven appeared.</p>

<p><q>Let us draw near</q> (he says) <q>with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart.</q> To what should we <q>draw near</q>? To the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the spiritual service. <q>With a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart, in full assurance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> since nothing is seen; neither the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> henceforward, nor the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, nor the altar. And yet neither was that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> visible, but stood within, and they all without, the whole people. But here not only has this taken place, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> has entered into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies, but that we also enter in. Therefore he says, <q>in full assurance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> For it is possible for the doubter to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one way, as there are even now many who say, that of some there is a resurrection and of others not. But this is not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>In full assurance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q> (he says); for we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> as concerning things that we see, nay, even much more; for <q>here</q> it is possible to be deceived in the things that are seen, but there not: <q>here</q> we trust to the senses, but there to the Spirit.</p>

<p><q>Having our hearts sprinkled from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</q> He shows that not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only, but a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life also is required, and the consciousness to ourselves of nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Since the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies does not receive <q>with full assurance</q> those who are not thus disposed. For they are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies; but here no profane person enters. They were sprinkled as to the body, we as to the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, so that we may even now be sprinkled over with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself. <q>And having our body washed with pure water.</q> Here he speaks of the Washing, which no longer cleanses the bodies, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p><q>For He is faithful that promised.</q> <q>That promised</q> what? That we are to depart there and enter into the kingdom. Be then in nothing over-curious, nor demand reasonings. Our [religion]  needs <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 10:24-25</h2>

<p>3. <q>And</q> (he says) <q>let us consider one another to provoke unto <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and to good works. Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting  one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching.</q> And again in other places, <q>The Lord is at hand; be careful for nothing.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse5">Philippians 4:5-6</a></span> <q>For now is our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> nearer: Henceforth the time is short.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse11">Romans 13:11</a></span></p>

<p>What is, <q>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse29">1 Corinthians 7:29</a></span> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that much strength arises from being together and assembling together. <q>For where two or three</q> (it is said) <q>are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse20">Matthew 18:20</a></span>; and again, <q>That they may be One, as we</q> also are <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse11">John 17:11</a></span>; and, <q>They had all one heart and [one] <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts 4:32</a></span> And not this only, but also because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is increased by the gathering [of ourselves] together; and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> being increased, of necessity the things of God must follow also. <q>And earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a></q> (it is said) was <q>made by</q> the people. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act012.htm#verse5">Acts 12:5</a></span> <q>As the manner of some is.</q> Here he not only exhorted, but also blamed [them].</p>

<p><q>And let us consider one another,</q> he says, <q>to provoke unto  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and to good works.</q> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that this also arises from <q>gathering together.</q> For as <q>iron sharpens iron</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro017.htm#verse17">Proverbs 17:17</a></span>, so also association increases <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For if a stone rubbed against a stone sends forth fire, how much more <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> mingled with <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! But not unto emulation (he says) but <q>unto the sharpening of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> What is <q>unto the sharpening of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a></q>? Unto the loving and being loved more. <q>And of good works</q>; that so they might acquire <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. For if doing has greater force for instruction than speaking, you also have in your number many teachers, who effect this by their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</p>

<p>What is <q>let us draw near with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart</q>? That is, without hypocrisy; for <q>woe be to a fearful heart, and faint hands</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir002.htm#verse12">Sirach 2:12</a></span>: let there be (he means) no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> among us; let us not say one thing and think another; for this is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; neither let us be fainthearted, for this is not [a mark] of a <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart.</q> Faintheartedness comes from not believing. But how shall this be? If we fully assure ourselves through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p><q>Having our hearts sprinkled</q>: why did he not say <q>having been purified</q>? [Because] he wished to point out the difference of the sprinklings: the one he says is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other our own. For the washing and sprinkling the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but <q>the drawing near with</q> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <q>in full assurance of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q> is our own. Then he also gives strength to their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Him that promised.</p>

<p>What is <q>and having our bodies washed with pure water</q>? With water which makes pure; or which has no blood.</p>

<p>Then he adds the perfect thing, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. &nbsp;<q>Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together,</q> which some (he says) do, and divide the assemblies.   For <q>a brother helped by a brother is as a strong city.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse19">Proverbs 18:19</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span></p>

<p><q>But let us consider one another to provoke unto <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> What is, <q>let us consider one another</q>? For instance if any be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, let us imitate him, let us look on him so as to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and to be loved. For from Love good works proceed. For the assembling is a great good: since it makes <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more warm; and out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things arise. For nothing is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> which is not done through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>4. This then let us <q>confirm</q>  towards each other. <q>For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the fulfilling of the law.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans 13:10</a></span> We have no need of labors or of sweatings if we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another. It is a pathway leading of itself towards <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For as on the highway, if any man find the beginning, he is guided by it, and has no need of one to take him by the hand; so is it also in regard to Love: only lay hold on the beginning, and at once you are guided and directed by it. <q>Love works no ill to his neighbor</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans 13:10</a></span>; <q>thinks no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 13:5</a></span> Let each man consider with himself, how he is disposed toward himself. He does not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> himself; he wishes all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things for himself; he prefers himself before all; he is willing to do all things for himself. If then we were so disposed towards others also, all grievous things are brought to an end; there is no enmity; there is no <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: for who would choose to overreach himself? No man; but on the contrary we shall possess all things in common, and shall not cease assembling ourselves together. And if we do this, the remembrance of injuries would have no place: for who would choose to remember injuries against himself? Who would choose to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with himself? Do we not make allowances for ourselves most of all? If we were thus disposed towards our neighbors also, there will never be any remembrance of injuries.</p>

<p>And how is it possible (you say) that one should so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his neighbor as himself? If others had not done this, you might well think it impossible: but if they have done it, it is plain that from indolence it is not done by ourselves.</p>

<p>And besides, Christ enjoins nothing impossible, seeing that many have even gone beyond His commands. Who has done this? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Peter, all the company of the Saints. Nay, indeed if I say that they loved their neighbors, I say no great matter: they so loved their enemies as no man would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those who were likeminded with himself. For who would choose for the sake of those likeminded, to go away into Hell. when he was about to depart unto a kingdom? No man. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> chose this for the sake of his enemies, for those who <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him, those who scourged him. What pardon then will there be for us, what excuse, if we shall not show towards our friends even the very smallest portion of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> showed towards his enemies?</p>

<p>And before him too, the blessed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was willing to be blotted out of God's book for the sake of his enemies who had <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> him. David also when he saw those who had stood up against him slain, says, <q>I, the shepherd, have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, but these, what have they done?</q> <span class="stiki">See <a href="../bible/2sa024.htm#verse17">2 Samuel 24:17</a></span> And when he had Saul in his hands, he would not slay him, but saved him; and this when he himself would be in danger. But if these things were done under the Old [Covenant] what excuse shall we have who live under the New, and do not attain even to the same measure with them? For if, <q>unless our righteousness exceed that of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, we shall not enter into the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew 5:20</a></span>, how shall we enter in when we have even less than they?</p>

<p>5. <q>Love your enemies,</q> He says. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew 5:44</a></span> Love thou therefore your enemy: for you are doing good not to him, but to yourself. How? You are becoming like God. He, if he be beloved of you, has no great gain, for he is beloved by a fellow-slave; but thou, if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your fellow-slave, hast gained much, for you are becoming like God. Do you see that you are doing a kindness not to him but to yourself? For He appoints the prize not for him, but for you.</p>

<p>What then if he be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> (you say)? So much the greater is the reward. Even for his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> you ought to feel grateful to him: even should he be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> after receiving ten thousand kindnesses. For if he were not exceedingly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, your reward would not have been exceedingly increased; so that the reason you assign, for not loving him, the saying that he is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, is the very reason for loving him. Take away the contestant and you take away the opportunity for the crowns. Do you see not the athletes, how they exercise when they have filled the bags with sand? But there is no need for you to practice this. Life is full of things that exercise you, and make you strong. Do you see not the trees too, the more they are shaken by the winds, so much the more do they become stronger and firmer? We then. if we be long-suffering, shall also become strong. For it is said, <q>a man who is long-suffering abounds in wisdom, but he that is of a little <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is strongly foolish.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse29">Proverbs 14:29</a></span> Do you see how great is his commendation of the one, do you see how great his censure of the other? <q>Strongly foolish,</q> i.e. very [foolish].  Let us not then be faint-hearted  one towards another: for this does not rise from enmity, but from having a small <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. As if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be strong, it will endure all things easily, and nothing will be able to sink it, but will lead it into tranquil havens. To which may we all attain, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, power, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and for ever and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
