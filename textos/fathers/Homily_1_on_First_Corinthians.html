<h1>Homily 1 on First Corinthians</h1>

<h2>1 Corinthians 1:1-3</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, called to be an Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Sosthenes our brother, unto the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> which is at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, even them that are sanctified in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, called to be Saints, with all that call upon the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> in every place, their Lord and ours: Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>1. See how immediately, from the very beginning, he casts down their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and dashes to the ground all their fond imagination, in that he speaks of himself as <q>called.</q> For what I have learned, says he, I discovered not myself, nor acquired by my own wisdom, but while I was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> and laying waste the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> I was called. Now here of Him that calls is everything: of him that is called, nothing, (so to speak,) but only to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>.</p>

<p><q>Of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> Your teacher is Christ; and do you register the names of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as patrons of your doctrine?</p>

<p><q>Through the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For it was God who willed that you should be saved in this way. We ourselves have wrought no good thing, but by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of God we have attained to this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and because it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to him, we were called, not because we were worthy.</p>

<p><q>And Sosthenes our brother.</q> Another instance of his modesty; he puts in the same rank with himself one inferior to Apollos; for great was the interval between <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Sosthenes. Now if where the interval was so wide he stations with himself one far beneath him, what can they have to say who despise their equals?</p>

<p><q>Unto the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>.</q> Not <q>of this or of that man,</q> but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p><q>Which is at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>.</q> Do you see how at each word he puts down their swelling <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; training their thoughts in every way for heaven? He calls it, too, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <q>of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> showing that it ought to be united. For if it be <q>of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> it is united, and it is one, not in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> only, but also in all the world: for the Church's name (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03BA;&#x03BA;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>: properly <em>an assembly</em>) is not a name of separation, but of unity and concord.</p>

<p><q>To the sanctified in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> Again the name of Jesus; the names of men he finds no place for. But what is Sanctification? The Laver, the Purification. For he reminds them of their own uncleanness, from which he had freed them; and so persuades them to lowliness of mind; for not by their own good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but by the loving-kindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had they been sanctified.</p>

<p><q>Called to be Saints.</q> For even this, to be saved by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is not says he, of yourselves; for you did not first draw near, but were called; so that not even this small matter is yours altogether. However, though you had drawn near, accountable as you are for innumerable wickednesses, not even so would the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be yours, but God's. Hence also, writing to the Ephesians, he said, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians 2:8</a></span> <q>By <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> have you been saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and this not of yourselves;</q> not even the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is yours altogether; for you were not first with your belief, but <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> a call.</p>

<p><q>With all who call upon the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> Not <q>of this or that man,</q> but <q>the Name of the Lord.</q></p>

<p>2. <q>In every place, both theirs and ours.</q> For although the letter be written to the Corinthians only, yet he makes mention of all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that are in all the earth; showing that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the world must be one, however separate in various places; and much more, that in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>. And though the place separate, the Lord binds them together, being common to all. Wherefore also uniting them he adds, <q>both theirs and ours.</q> And this is far more powerful [to unite], than the other [to separate]. For as men in one place, having many and contrary masters, become distracted, and their one place helps them not to be of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, their masters giving orders at variance with each other, and drawing each their own way, according to what Christ says, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew 6:24</a></span> <q>You cannot serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">Mammon</a>;</q> so those in different places, if they have not different lords but one only, are not by the places injured in respect of unanimity, the One Lord binding them together. <q>I say not then, (so he speaks,) that with Corinthians only, you being Corinthians ought to be of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but with all that are in the whole world, inasmuch as you have a common Master.</q> This is also why he has a second  time added <q>our;</q> for since he had said, <q>the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord,</q> lest he should appear to the inconsiderate to be making a distinction, he subjoins again, <q>both our Lord and theirs.</q></p>

<p>3. That my meaning may be clearer, I will read it according to its sense thus: <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Sosthenes to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> and to all who call upon the Name of Him who is both our Lord and theirs in every place, whether in Rome or wheresoever else they may be: <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto you and peace from God our Father and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>Or again thus; which I also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be rather more correct: <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Sosthenes to those that are at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, who have been sanctified, called to be Saints, together with all who call upon the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> in place, both theirs and ours;</q> that is to say, <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto you, and peace unto you, who are at <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, who have been sanctified and called;</q> not to you alone, but <q>with all who in every place call upon the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our Lord and theirs.</q></p>

<p>Now if our peace be of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, why have you high thoughts? Why are You so puffed up, being saved by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? And if you have peace with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why wish to assign yourself to others? Since this is what separation comes to. For what if you be at <q>peace</q> with this man, and with the other even find <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?</q> My <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is that both these may be yours from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; both from Him I say, and towards Him. For neither do they abide (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span>, Savile in marg.) secure except they enjoy the influence from above; nor unless God be their object will they anything avail you: for it profits us nothing, though we be peaceful towards all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, if we be at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; even as it is no harm to us, although by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> we are held as enemies, if with God we are at peace. And again it is no gain to us, if all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> approve, and the Lord be offended; neither is there any danger, though all shun and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, if with God we have acceptance and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For that which is verily <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and verily peace, comes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since he who finds <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in God's sight, though he suffer ten thousand horrors, fears no one; I say not only, no man, but not even the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself; but he that has offended God suspects all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, though he seem to be in security. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is unstable, and not friends only and brethren, but fathers also, before now, have been altogether changed and often for a little thing he whom they begot, the branch of their planting, has been to them, more than all foes, an object of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Children, too, have cast off their fathers. Thus, if you will mark it, David was in favor with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Absalom was in favor with men. What was the end of each, and which of them gained most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was in favor with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> with men; for to gratify him they gave up the just man's wife. <span class="stiki">See St. John Chrysostom on Genesis 12:17</span> Which then of the two was the more illustrious, and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> man? Every one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. And why speak I of righteous men; The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> were in favor with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but they were <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by men, the Egyptians; but nevertheless they prevailed against their haters and vanquished them, with how great triumph, is well known to you all.</p>

<p>For this, therefore, let all of us labor earnestly; whether one be a slave, let him <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for this, that he may find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with God rather than with his master; or a wife, let her seek <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from God her Saviour rather than from her husband; or a soldier, in preference to his king and commander let him seek that favor which comes from above. For thus among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> also will you be an object of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>4. But how shall a man find <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with God? How else, except by lowliness of mind? For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says one, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James 4:6</a></span> <q>resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, but gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>; and, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse17">Psalm 51:17</a>. <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03BD;</span></span> the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of God is a broken spirit, and a heart that is brought low God will not despise.</q> For if with men humility is so lovely, much more with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus both they of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> found <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> no other way fell from <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse13">Romans 10:13</a></span> <q>for they were not subject unto the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> The lowly man of whom I am speaking, is pleasing and delightful to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and dwells in continual peace, and has in him no ground for contentions. For though you insult him, though you abuse him, whatsoever you say, he will be silent and will bear it meekly, and will have so great peace towards all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as one cannot even describe. Yea, and with God also. For the commandments of God are to be at peace with men: and thus our whole life is made prosperous, through peace one with another. For no man can injure God: His nature is imperishable, and above all suffering. Nothing makes the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> so admirable as lowliness of mind. Hear, for instance, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> saying, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse27">Genesis 18:27</a></span> <q>But I am but dust and ashes;</q> and again, God [saying] of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse3">Numbers 12:3</a></span> <q>he was the meekest of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> For nothing was ever more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> than he; who, being leader of so great a people, and having overwhelmed in the sea the king and the host of all the Egyptians, as if they had been flies; and having wrought so many wonders both in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> and in the wilderness, and received such high testimony, yet felt exactly as if he had been an ordinary person, and as a son-in-law was humbler than his father-in-law, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo018.htm#verse24">Exodus 18:24</a></span> and took  advice from him, and was not indignant, nor did he say, <q>What is this? After such and so great achievements, are you come to us with your counsel?</q> This is what most people feel; though a man bring the best advice, despising it, because of the lowliness of the person. But not so did he: rather through lowliness of mind he wrought all things well. Hence also he despised the courts of kings, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse24">Hebrews 11:24-26</a></span> since he was lowly indeed: for the sound mind and the high spirit are the fruit of humility. For of how great nobleness and magnanimity, do you think, was it a token, to despise the kingly palace and table? Since kings among the Egyptians are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> as gods, and enjoy <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and treasures inexhaustible. But nevertheless, letting go all these and throwing away the very sceptres of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, he hastened to join himself unto captives, and men worn down with toil, whose strength was spent in the clay and the making of bricks, men whom his own slaves abhorred, (for, says he <span class="greek">&#x1F10;&#x03B2;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;</span>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>. <a href="../bible/exo001.htm#verse2">Exodus 1:2</a></span> <q>The Egyptians abhorred them;</q>) unto these he ran and preferred them before their masters. From whence it is plain, that whoso is lowly, the same is high and great of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> comes from an ordinary mind and an ignoble spirit, but moderation, from greatness of mind and a lofty <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>5. And if you please, let us try each by examples. For tell me, what was there ever more exalted than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? And yet it was he that said, <q>I am but dust and ashes;</q> it was he who said, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen013.htm#verse8">Genesis 13:8</a></span> <q>Let there be no strife between me and you.</q> But this man, so <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse21">Genesis 14:21-24</a></span> despised (<q>Persian,</q> i.e. perhaps, <q>of Elam.</q>) Persian spoils, and regarded not Barbaric trophies; and this he did of much highmindedness, and of a spirit nobly nurtured. For he is indeed exalted who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>; (not the flatterer nor the dissembler;) for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> greatness is one thing, and arrogance another. And this is plain from hence; if one man esteem clay to be clay, and despise it, and another admire the clay as gold, and account it a great thing; which, I ask, is the man of exalted mind? Is it not he who refuses to admire the clay? And which, abject and mean? Is it not he who admires it, and set much store by it? Just so do thou esteem of this case also; that he who calls himself but dust and ashes is exalted, although he say it out of humility; but that he who does not consider himself dust and ashes, but treats himself lovingly and has high thoughts, this man for his part must be counted mean, esteeming little things to be great. Whence it is clear that out of great loftiness of thought the patriarch spoke that saying, <q>I am but dust and ashes;</q> from loftiness of thought, not from arrogance.</p>

<p>For as in bodies it is one thing to be healthy and plump, (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03B3;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>, firm and elastic.) and another thing to be swoln, although both indicate a full habit of flesh, (but in this case of unsound, in that of healthful flesh;) so also here: it is one thing to be arrogant, which is, as it were, to be swoln, and another thing to be high-souled, which is to be in a healthy state. And again, one man is tall from the stature of his person; another, being short, by adding buskins  becomes taller; now tell me, which of the two should we call tall and large? Is it not quite plain, him whose height is from himself? For the other has it as something not his own; and stepping upon things low in themselves, turns out a tall person. Such is the case with many men who mount themselves up on <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; which is not exaltation, for he is exalted who wants none of these things, but despises them, and has his greatness from himself. Let us therefore become <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> that we may become exalted; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse11">Luke 14:11</a></span> <q>For he that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself shall be exalted.</q> Now the self-willed man is not such as this; rather he is of all characters the most ordinary. For the bubble, too, is inflated, but the inflation is not sound; wherefore we call these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <q>puffed up.</q> Whereas the sober-minded man has no high thoughts, not even in high fortunes, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> his own low estate; but the vulgar even in his trifling concerns indulges a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> fancy.</p>

<p>6. Let us then acquire that height which comes by humility. Let us look into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, that we may kindle with the longing desire of the things to come; for in no other way is it possible to become <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, except by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of what is divine and the contempt of what is present. For just as a man on the point of obtaining a kingdom, if instead of that purple robe one offer him some trivial compliment, will count it to be nothing; so shall we also laugh to scorn all things present, if we desire that other sort of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Do you not see the children, when in their play they make a band of soldiers, and heralds precede them and lictors, and a boy marches in the midst in the general's place, how childish it all is? Just such are all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs; yea and more worthless than these: today they are, and tomorrow they are not. Let us therefore be above these things; and let us not only not desire them, but even be ashamed if any one hold them forth to us. For thus, casting out the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of these things, we shall possess that other <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is divine, and shall enjoy <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Which may God grant us all to obtain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and loving-kindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; with whom be to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and good Spirit, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the power for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
