<h1>Homily 1 on First Thessalonians</h1>

<p class="c12"><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><a href="../bible/1th001.htm#verse1">1 Thessalonians 1:1-3</a></span> </p>

<p><q> <em><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Thessalonians in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>: Grace to you, and peace.</em>  <em>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; remembering without ceasing your work of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and labor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and patience of hope in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, before our God and Father.</em></q></p>

<p><span class="sc">Wherefore</span> then, when writing to the Ephesians,  and having Timothy with him, did he not include him with himself (in his salutation), <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as he was to them and admired, for he says, <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of him, that as a child serves the father, so he served with me in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse22">Philippians 2:22</a></span>; and again, <q>I have no man like-minded who will care <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> for your state</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse20">Philippians 2:20</a></span>; but here he does associate him with himself? It seems to me, that he was about to send him immediately, and it was superfluous for him to write, who would overtake the letter. For he says, <q>Him therefore I hope to send immediately.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse23">Philippians 2:23</a></span> But here it was not so; but he had just returned to him, so that he naturally joined in the letter. For he says, <q>Now when Timothy came from you unto us.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th003.htm#verse6">1 Thessalonians 3:6</a></span> But why does he place Silvanus before him,  though he testifies to his numberless good qualities, and prefers him above all? Perhaps Timothy wished and requested him to do so from his great humility; for when he saw his teacher so humble-minded, as to associate his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> with himself, he would much the more have desired this, and eagerly sought it. For he says,</p>

<p><q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Thessalonians.</q> Here he gives himself no title&mdash; not <q>an Apostle,</q> not <q>a Servant</q>; I suppose, because the men were newly instructed, and had not yet had any experience of him,  he does not apply the title; and it was as yet the beginning of his preaching to them.</p>

<p><q>To the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Thessalonians,</q> he says. And well. For it is probable there were few, and they not yet formed into a body; on this account he consoles them with the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For where much time had passed, and the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was large, he does not apply this term. But because the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is for the most part a name of multitude, and of a system  now compacted, on this account he calls them by that name.</p>

<p><q>In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> he says, <q>and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <q>Unto the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Thessalonians,</q> he says, <q>which is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Behold again the expression, <q>in,</q>  applied both to the Father and to the Son. For there were many assemblies,  both Jewish and Grecian; but he says, <q>to the (Church) that is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> It is a great dignity, and to which there is nothing equal, that it is <q>in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> God grant therefore that this Church may be so addressed! But I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that it is far from that appellation. For if any one were the servant of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he cannot be said to be <q>in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> If any one walks not according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he cannot be said to be <q>in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> </p>

<p><q>Grace be unto you, and peace.</q>  Do you perceive that the very commencement of his Epistle is with encomiums? <q>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.</q> For to give thanks to God for them is the act of one testifying to their great advancement, when they are not only praised themselves, but God also is thanked for them, as Himself having done it all. He teaches them also to be moderate, all but saying, that it is all of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. That he gives thanks for them, therefore, is on account of their good conduct, but that he remembers them in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, proceeds from his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards them. Then as he often does, he says that he not only remembers them in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but apart from his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. <q>Remembering without ceasing,</q> he says, <q>your work of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and labor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and patience of hope in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, before our God and Father.</q> What is remembering without ceasing? Either remembering before God and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or remembering your labor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that is before God and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or simply, <q>Remembering you without ceasing.</q> Then again, that you may not think that this <q>remembering you without ceasing</q> is said simply, he has added, <q>before our God and Father.</q> And because no one among men was praising their actions, no one giving them any reward, he says this, <q>You labor before God.</q> What is <q>the work of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q>? That nothing has turned aside your steadfastness. For this is the work of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If you believe, suffer all things; if you dost not suffer, thou dost not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For are not the things promised such, that he who believes would choose to suffer even ten thousand deaths? The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is set before him, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. He therefore who believes will suffer all things. Faith then is shown through his works. Justly might one have said, not merely did you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but through your works you manifested it, through your steadfastness, through your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>.</p>

<p>And your labor <q>of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> Why? What labor is it to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Merely to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is no labor at all. But to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> genuinely is great labor. For tell me, when a thousand things are stirred up that would draw us from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and we hold out against them all, is it not labor? For what did not these men suffer, that they might not revolt from their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Did not they that warred against the Preaching go to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> host, and not having found him, drag Jason before the rulers of the city? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse5">Acts 17:5-6</a></span> Tell me, is this a slight labor, when the seed had not yet taken root, to endure so great a storm, so many trials? And they demanded security of him. And having given security, he says, Jason sent away <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.  Is this a small thing, tell me? Did not Jason expose himself to danger for him? And this he calls a labor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because they were thus bound to him.</p>

<p>And observe: first he mentions their good actions, then his own, that he may not seem to boast, nor yet to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them by anticipation.  <q>And patience,</q> he says. For that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> was not confined to one time, but was continual, and they warred not only with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the teacher, but with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also. For if they were thus affected towards those who wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, those venerable men; what think you were their feelings towards those who dwelt among them, their fellow citizens, who had all of a sudden revolted from them? Wherefore this also he testifies of them, saying, <q>For you became imitators of the Churches of God which are in Jud&aelig;a.</q></p>

<p><q>And of hope,</q> he says, <q>in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, before our God and Father.</q> For all these things proceed from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope, so that what happened to them showed not their <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> only, but that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with full assurance in the rewards laid up for them. For on this account God permitted that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> should arise immediately, that no one might say, that the Preaching was established lightly or by flattery, and that their fervor might be shown, and that it was not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> persuasion, but the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that persuaded the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, so that they were prepared even for ten thousand deaths, which would not have been the case, if the Preaching had not immediately been deeply fixed and remained unshaken.</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ver. 4, 5. <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a>, brethren beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your election, how that our <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and in much assurance; even as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what manner of men we showed ourselves among  you for your sake.</q></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> what? How <q>we showed ourselves among you</q>? Here he also touches upon his own good actions, but covertly. For he wishes first to enlarge upon their praises, and what he says is something of this sort. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that you were men of great and noble sort, that you were of the Elect. For this reason we also endure all things for your sake. For this, <q>what manner of men we showed ourselves among you,</q> is the expression of one showing that with much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and much vehemence we were ready to give up our lives for your sake; and for this thanks are due not to us, but to you, because you were elect. On this account also he says elsewhere, <q>And these things I endure for the Elect's sake.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse10">2 Timothy 2:10</a></span> For what would not one endure for the sake of God's beloved ones? And having spoken of his own part, he all but says, For if you were both beloved and elect, we suffer all things with reason. For not only did his praise of them confirm them, but his reminding them that they too themselves had displayed a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> corresponding to their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>: he says,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th001.htm#verse6">Ver. 6</a>. <q>And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q></p>

<p>Strange! What an encomium is here! The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have suddenly become teachers! They not only heard the word, but they quickly arrived at the same height with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. But this is nothing; for see how he exalts them, saying, <q>You became imitators of the Lord.</q> How? <q>Having received the word in much affliction, with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> Not merely with affliction, but with much affliction. And this we may learn from the Acts of the Apostles, how they raised a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> against them. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse5">Acts 17:5-8</a></span> And they troubled all the rulers of the city, and they instigated the city against them. And it is not enough to say, you were afflicted indeed, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and that grieving, but even rejoicing. Which also the Apostles did: <q>Rejoicing,</q> it is said, <q>that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the Name.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse41">Acts 5:41</a></span> For it is this that is admirable. Although neither is that a slight matter, in any way to bear afflictions. But this now was the part of men surpassing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, and having, as it were, a body incapable of suffering.</p>

<p>But how were they imitators of the Lord? Because He also endured many sufferings, but rejoiced. For He came to this willingly. For our sakes He emptied Himself. He was about to be spit upon, to be beaten and crucified, and He so rejoiced in suffering these things, that He said to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>Glorify Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse1">John 17:1-5</a></span></p>

<p><q>With <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> he says. That no one may say, how do you speak of <q>affliction</q>? How <q>of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a></q>? How can both meet in one? He has added, <q>with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> The affliction is in things bodily, and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in things spiritual. How? The things which happened to them were grievous, but not so the things which sprang out of them, for the Spirit does not allow it.  So that it is possible both for him who suffers, not to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, when one suffers for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and being beaten to take pleasure, when one suffers for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake. For such is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the Spirit. In return for the things which appear to be grievous, it brings out delight. They have afflicted you, he says, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> you, but the Spirit did not forsake you, even in those circumstances. As the Three Children in the fire were refreshed with dew,  so also were you refreshed in afflictions. But as there it was not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the fire to sprinkle dew, but of the <q>whistling wind,</q>  so also here it was not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of affliction to produce <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, but of the suffering for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, and of the Spirit bedewing them, and in the furnace of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> setting them at ease. Not merely with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, he says, but <q>with much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q> For this is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th001.htm#verse7">Ver. 7</a>. <q>So that you became ensamples  to all that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Macedonia and Achaia.</q></p>

<p>And yet it was later that he went to them. But ye so shone, he says, that you became teachers of those who received (the word) before you. And this is like the Apostle. For he did not say, so that you became ensamples in regard to believing, but you became an ensample to those who already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; how one ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you taught, who from the very beginning entered into your conflict.</p>

<p><q>And in Achaia,</q> he says; that is, in Greece.</p>

<p>Do you see how great a thing is <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>? That it does not require time, nor delay, nor procrastination, but it is sufficient only to venture one's self, and all is fulfilled. Thus then though coming in later to the Preaching, they became teachers of those who were before them.</p>

<p>Moral . Let no one therefore despair, even though he has lost much time, and has done nothing. It is possible for him even in a little while to do so much, as he never has done in all his former time. For if he who before did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, shone so much at the beginning, how much more those who have already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>! Let no one, again, upon this consideration be remiss, because he perceives that it is possible in a short time to recover everything. For the future is uncertain, and the Day of the Lord is a thief, setting upon us suddenly when we are sleeping. But if we do not sleep, it will not set upon us as a thief, nor carry us off unprepared. For if we watch and be sober, it will not set upon us as a thief, but as a royal messenger, summoning us to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things prepared for us. But if we sleep, it comes upon us as a thief. Let no one therefore sleep, nor be inactive in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for that is sleep. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how, when we sleep, our goods are not in safety, how easy they are to be plotted against? But when we are awake, there needs not so much guarding. When we sleep, even with much guarding we often perish. There are doors, and bolts, and guards, and outer guards, and the thief has come upon us.</p>

<p>Why then do I say this? Because, if we wake we shall not need the help of others; but if we sleep, the help of others will profit us nothing, but even with this we perish. It is a good thing to enjoy the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the Saints, but it is when we ourselves also are on the alert. And what need, you say, have I of another's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, if I am on the alert myself. And in truth, do not place yourself in a situation to need it; I do not wish that you should; but we are always in need of it, if we think rightly. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did not say, what need have I of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? And yet those who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> were not worthy of him,  or rather not equal to him; and you say, what need have I of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? Peter did not say, What need have I of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, for <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,</q> it says, <q>was made earnestly of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> unto God for him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act012.htm#verse5">Acts 12:5</a></span> And you say, What need have I of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? On this account you need it, because you think that you have no need. Yea, though thou become as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, you have need of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Do not exalt yourself, lest you be humbled.</p>

<p>But, as I said, if we be active also ourselves, the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for us avail too. Hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saying, <q>For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this shall turn to my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, through your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse19">Philippians 1:19</a></span> And again, <q>That for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> on our behalf.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse11">2 Corinthians 1:11</a></span> And you say, what need have I of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? But if we be idle, no one will be able to profit us. What did Jeremiah profit the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Did he not thrice draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the third time hear, <q>Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, for I will not hear you</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse16">Jeremiah 7:16</a></span> What did Samuel profit Saul? Did he not mourn for him even to his last day, and not merely <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him only? What did he profit the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>? Did he not say, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in ceasing to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa012.htm#verse23">1 Samuel 12:23</a></span> Did they not all perish? Do <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> then, you say, profit nothing? They profit even greatly: but it is when we also do something. For <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> indeed co&ouml;perate and assist, but a man co&ouml;perates with one  that is operating, and assists one that is himself also working. But if you remain idle, you will receive no great benefit.</p>

<p>For if <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> had power to bring us to the kingdom while we do nothing, why do not all the Greeks become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? Do we not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all the world? Did not <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also do this? Do we not intreat that all may be converted? Why do not the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> become good without contributing anything of themselves? Prayers, then, profit greatly, when we also contribute our own parts.</p>

<p>Would you learn how much <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have profited? Consider, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, Cornelius, Tabitha. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse3">Acts 10:3</a> and <a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse36">9:36</a></span> Hear also Jacob saying to Laban, <q>Except the Fear of my father had been with me, surely you had now sent me away empty.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen031.htm#verse42">Genesis 31:42</a></span> Hear also God again, saying, <q>I will defend this city for My own sake, and for My servant David's sake.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ki009.htm#verse34">2 Kings 9:34</a></span> But when? In the time of Hezekiah, who was righteous. Since if <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> availed even for the extremely <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, why did not God say this also when <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> came, and why did He give up the city? Because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> availed more. Again, Samuel himself also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, and prevailed. But when? When they also pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then they put their enemies to flight. And what need, you say, of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> from another, when I myself please God? Never, O man, say this. There is need, aye, and need of much <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For hear God saying concerning the friends of Job; <q>And he shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you, and your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall be forgiven you.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job042.htm#verse8">Job 42:8</a></span> Because they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> indeed, but not a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this just man, who then saved his friends by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in the season of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> was not able to save the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were perishing. And that you may learn this, hear God saying through the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; <q>If <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Daniel, and Job stood, they shall not deliver their sons and their daughters.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze014.htm#verse14">Ezekiel 14:14-16</a></span> Because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> prevailed. And again, <q>Though <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Samuel stood.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse1">Jeremiah 15:1</a></span></p>

<p>And see how this is said to the two Prophets, because both <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them, and did not prevail. For Ezekiel says, <q>Ah Lord, do you blot out the residue of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze009.htm#verse8">Ezekiel 9:8</a></span> Then showing that He does this <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, He shows him their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and showing that not through despising him does He refuse to accept his supplication for them, he says, Even these things are enough even to persuade you, that not despising you, but on account of their many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I do not accept your supplication. Nevertheless He adds, <q>Though. <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Job, and Daniel stood.</q> <span class="stiki">From <a href="../bible/eze014.htm">Ezekiel 14</a></span> And with good reason does He the rather say this to him, because it is he who suffered so many things. Thou badest me, he says, eat upon dung, and I ate upon it.  Thou badest me, and I shaved my head. Thou badest me, and I lay upon one side. Thou badest me go out through a hole in the wall, bearing a burden, and I went out. Thou tookest away my wife, and badest me not mourn, and I did not mourn, but bore it with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze024.htm#verse18">Ezekiel 24:18</a></span> Ten thousand other things have I wrought for their sake: I entreat for them, and dost Thou not comply? Not from despising you, says he, do I do this, but though <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Job, and Daniel were there, and were entreating for sons and daughters, I would not comply.</p>

<p>And again to Jeremiah, who suffered less from the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but more from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, what does He say? <q>Do you see not what these do?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse17">Jeremiah 7:17</a></span> <q>Yea,</q> he says, <q>they do so&mdash; but do Thou do it for my sake.</q> On this account He says to him, <q>Though <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Samuel stood.</q> Their first lawgiver, who often delivered them from dangers, who had said, <q>If now you forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, forgive it; but if not, blot me out also.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse32">Exodus 32:32</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> If therefore he were now alive, and spoke thus, he would not have prevailed&mdash;nor would Samuel, again, who himself also delivered them, and who from his earliest youth was admired. For to the former indeed I said, that I conversed with him as a friend with a friend, and not by dark sayings. And of the latter I said, that in his first youth I was revealed to him, and that on his account, being prevailed upon, I opened the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that had been shut up. For <q>the word of the Lord,</q> it is said, <q>was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa003.htm#verse1">1 Samuel 3:1</a></span> If these men, therefore, stood before Me, they would profit nothing. And of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> He says, <q><a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was a righteous man, and perfect in his generations.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse9">Genesis 6:9</a></span> And concerning Job, He was <q>blameless, just, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, fearing God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse1">Job 1:1</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> And concerning Daniel, whom they even thought a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and they will not deliver, says he, their sons and daughters. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> these things, therefore, let us neither despise the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the Saints, nor throw everything upon them: that we may not, on the one hand, be indolent and live carelessly; nor on the other deprive ourselves of a great advantage. But let us both beseech them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and lift up the hand for us, and let us adhere to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; that we may be able to obtain the blessings promised to those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and loving-kindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom, etc.</p>
