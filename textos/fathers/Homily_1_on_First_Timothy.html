<h1>Homily 1 on First Timothy</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->1 Timothy 1:1, 2</strong></p>

<p> <em><q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, an Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, which is our hope; unto Timothy, my own son in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> [The R.V. omits</em> <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;</span> <em>and translates: Christ Jesus our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a></em>, <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1FC6;&#x03C2; &#x1F10;&#x03BB;&#x03C0;&#x1F77;&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x1F21;&#x03BC;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;</span> <em>.]</em></p>

<p>1. Great and admirable is the dignity of an Apostle, and we find <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> constantly setting forth the causes of it, not as if he took the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to himself, but as entrusted with it, and being under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of so doing. For when he speaks of himself as <q>called,</q> and that <q>by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and again elsewhere, <q>a necessity is laid upon me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 9:16</a></span>, and when he says, <q>for this I was separated,</q> by these expressions all idea of arrogance and ambition is removed. For as he deserves the severest blame, who intrudes into an office which is not given him of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so he who refuses, and shrinks from it when offered to him, incurs blame of another kind, that of rebellion and disobedience. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in the beginning of this Epistle, thus expresses himself, <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, an Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> He does not say here, <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> called,</q> but <q>by commandment.</q> He begins in this manner, that Timothy may not feel any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity from supposing that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> addresses him on the same terms as his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. But where is this commandment given? We read in the Acts of the Apostles: <q>The Spirit said, Separate me <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act013.htm#verse2">Acts 13:2</a></span> And everywhere in his writings <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> adds the name of Apostle, to instruct his hearers not to consider the doctrines he delivered as proceeding from man. For an Apostle  can say nothing of his own, and by calling himself an Apostle, he at once refers his hearers to Him that sent him. In all his Epistles therefore he begins by assuming this title, thus giving authority to his words, as here he says, <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, an Apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> according to the commandment of God our Saviour.</q> Now it does not appear that the Father anywhere commanded him. It is everywhere Christ who addresses him. Thus, <q>He said unto me, Depart, for I will send you far hence unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse21">Acts 22:21</a></span>; and again, <q>You must be brought before C&aelig;sar.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act027.htm#verse24">Acts 27:24</a></span> But whatever the Son commands, this he considers to be the commandment of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as those of the Spirit are the commandments of the Son. For he was sent by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he was separated by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and this he says was the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What then? Does it derogate from the power of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, that His Apostle was sent forth by the commandment of the Father? By no means. For observe, how he represents the power as common to both. For having said, <q>according to the commandment of God our Saviour</q>; he adds, <q>and Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, our hope.</q> And observe, with what propriety he applies the titles.  And indeed, the Psalmist applies this to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, saying, <q>The hope of all the ends of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa063.htm#verse5">Psalm 64:5</a></span> And again, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> in another place writes, <q>For therefore we both labor, and suffer reproach, because we have hope in the living God.</q> The teacher must suffer dangers even more than the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. For I will smite the shepherd, (he says,) <q>and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/zec013.htm#verse7">Zechariah 13:7</a></span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> rages with greater <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against teachers, because by their destruction the flock also is scattered. For by slaying the sheep, he has lessened the flock, but when he has made away with the shepherd, he has ruined the whole flock, so that he the rather assaults him, as working greater mischief by a less effort; and in one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> effecting the ruin of all. For this reason <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, at the beginning, elevates and encourages the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of Timothy, by saying, We have God for our Saviour and Christ for our hope. We suffer much, but our hopes are great; we are exposed to snares and perils, but to save us we have not man but God. Our Saviour is not weak, for He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whatever be our dangers they will not overcome us; nor is our hope made ashamed, for it is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  For in two ways we are enabled to bear up against dangers, when we are either speedily delivered from them, or supposed by good hopes under them.</p>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> never calls himself the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but always of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Because he makes everything common to both. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> itself he calls <q>the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  And whatever we suffer here, he implies, things present are as nothing.</p>

<p><q>Unto Timothy, my own son in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q></p>

<p>This too is encouraging. For if he evinced such <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as to be called peculiarly <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <q>own</q> son, he might be confident also with respect to the future. For it is the part of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> not to be cast down or disturbed, though circumstances occur that seem contrary to the promises. But observe he says, <q>my son,</q> and even <q>my own son,</q> and yet he is not of the same substance. But what? Was he of irrational kind? <q>Well,</q> says one, <q>he was not of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, so this does not imply 'being of' another.</q> What then? Was he of another substance? Neither was it so, for after saying <q>my own son,</q> he adds, <q>in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> to show that he was really <q>his own son,</q> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> from him. There was no difference. The likeness he bore to him was in respect to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> births there is a likeness in respect of substance. The son is like the father in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, but with respect to God the proximity is greater.  For here a father and a son, though of the same substance, differ in many particulars, as in color, figure, understanding, age, bent of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, endowments of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and in many other things they may be like or unlike, but there is no such dissimilarity in the divine Essence. <q>By commandment.</q> This is a stronger expression than <q>called</q>, as we learn from other passages. As he here calls Timothy <q>my own son,</q> in like manner he says to the Corinthians, <q>in Christ Jesus I have begotten you,</q> i.e. in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but he adds the word <q>own,</q>  to show his particular likeness to himself, as well as his own <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and great affection for him. Notice again the <q>in</q> applied to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <q>My own son,</q> he says, <q>in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> See what an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> distinction, in that he calls him not only his <q>son,</q> but his <q>own</q> son.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse2">Ver. 2</a>. <q>Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q></p>

<p>Why is mercy mentioned here, and not in the other Epistles? This is a further mark of his affection. Upon his son he invokes greater blessings, with the anxious apprehension of a parent. For such was his anxiety, that he gives directions to Timothy, which he has done in no other case, to attend to his bodily health; where he says, <q>Use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and your frequent infirmities</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1 Timothy 5:23</a></span> Teachers indeed stand more in need of mercy.</p>

<p><q>From God our Father,</q> he says, <q>and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q></p>

<p>Here too is consolation. For if God is our Father, He cares for us as sons, as Christ says, <q>What man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse9">Matthew 7:9</a></span></p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse3">Ver. 3</a>. <q>As I besought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia.</q></p>

<p>Observe the gentleness of the expression, more like that of a servant than of a master. For he does not say <q>I commanded,</q> or <q>bade</q> or even <q>exhorted,</q> but <q>I besought you.</q> But this tone is not for all: only meek and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are to be treated thus. The corrupt and insincere are to be dealt with in a different manner, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself elsewhere directs, <q>Rebuke them with all authority</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse15">Titus 2:15</a></span>; and here he says <q>charge,</q> not <q>beseech,</q> but <q>charge some that they teach no other doctrine.</q> What means this? That <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> Epistle which he sent them was not sufficient? Nay, it was sufficient; but men are apt sometimes to slight Epistles, or perhaps this may have been before the Epistles were written. He had himself passed some time in that city. There was the temple of Diana, and there he had been exposed to those great sufferings. For after the assembly in the Theater had been dissolved, and he had called to him and exhorted the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he found it necessary to sail away, though afterwards he returned to them. It were worth enquiry, whether he stationed Timothy there at that time.  For he says, that <q>you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine</q>: he does not mention the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by name, that he might not, by the openness of his rebuke, render them more shameless. There were in that city certain false Apostles of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who wished to oblige the faithful to observe the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a>, a fault he is everywhere noticing in his Epistles; and this they did not from motives of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, so much as from vainglory, and a wish to have <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, from jealousy of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, and a spirit of opposition to him. This is meant by <q>teaching another doctrine.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse4">Ver. 4</a>. <q>Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies.</q></p>

<p>By <q>fables</q> he does not mean the law; far from it; but inventions and forgeries and counterfeit doctrines. For, it seems, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> wasted their whole discourse on these unprofitable points. They numbered up their fathers and grandfathers, that they might have the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of historical <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and research. <q>That you might charge some,</q> he says, <q>that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies.</q> Why does he call them <q>endless</q>? It is because they had no end, or none of any use, or none easy for us to apprehend. Mark how he disapproves of questioning. For where <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> exists, there is no need of question. Where there is no room for curiosity, questions are superfluous. Questioning is the subversion of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  For he that seeks has not yet found. He who questions cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Therefore it is his advice that we should not be occupied with questions, since if we question, it is not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> sets reasoning at rest. But why then does Christ say, <q>Seek and you shall find, knock and it shall be opened unto you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew 7:7</a></span>; and, <q>Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, for in them you think you have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John 5:39</a></span> The seeking there is meant of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and vehement desire, and He bids <q>search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,</q> not to introduce the labors of questioning, but to end them, that we may ascertain and settle their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning, not that we may be ever questioning, but that we may have done with it. And he <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> said, <q>Charge some that they teach no other doctrine, neither give heed to fables, and endless genealogies, which minister questions rather than the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q>  Justly has he said, <q>the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For great are the blessings which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is willing to dispense; but the greatness of them is not conceived by reasoning. This must then be the work of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is the best medicine of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. This questioning therefore is opposed to the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For what is dispensed by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? To receive His mercies and become better men; to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> and dispute of nothing; but to repose in confidence. For what <q>ministers questions</q> displaces <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and that which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has wrought and built. Christ has said that we must be saved by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; this these teachers questioned and even denied. For since the announcement was present, but the issue of it future, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was required. But they bring preoccupied by legal observances threw impediments in the way of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He seems also here to glance at the Greeks, where he speaks of <q>fables and genealogies,</q> for they enumerated their Gods.</p>

<p> <em>Moral</em>. Let us not then give heed to questions. For we were called Faithful, that we might unhesitatingly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what is delivered to us, and entertain no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. For if the things asserted were <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, we ought to examine them; but since they are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are only to be revered and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. If we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, how shall we be persuaded of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a God? For how do you know that there is a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when you call Him to account? The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God is best shown by believing in Him without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> and demonstrations. Even the Greeks <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this; for they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> their Gods telling them, says one, even without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>; and what?&mdash; That  they were the offspring of the Gods. But why do I speak of the Gods? In the case of the man, a deceiver and sorcerer,  (I speak of Pythagoras,) they acted in like manner, for of him it was said,  He said it.  And over their temples was an image of Silence, and her finger on her mouth, compressing her lips, and significantly exhorting all that passed by to be silent. And were their doctrines so sacred, and are ours less so? And even to be ridiculed? What extreme <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is this! The tenets of the Greeks indeed are rightly questioned. For they were of that nature, being but disputes, conflicts of reasonings, and doubts, and conclusions. But ours are far from all these. For <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom invented theirs, but ours were taught by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit. Their doctrines are <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and folly, ours are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom. In their case there is neither teacher nor scholar; but all alike are disputants. Here whether teacher or scholar, each is to learn  of him from whom he ought to learn, and not to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, but <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>; not to dispute, but believe. For all the ancients obtained a good report through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and without this everything is subverted. And why do I speak of it in heavenly things? We shall find upon examination that earthly things depend upon it no less. For without this there would be no trade nor contracts, nor anything of the sort. And if it be so necessary here in things that are false, how much more in those. </p>

<p>This then let us pursue, to this let us adhere, so shall we banish from our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> all destructive doctrines, such, for instance, as relate to nativity  and <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>.  If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is a resurrection and a judgment, you will be able to expel from your mind all those false opinions. Believe that there is a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there can be an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> nativity. Believe that there is a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a Providence,  and you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there can be a nativity, that holds all things together.  Believe that there is a place of punishment, and a Kingdom, and you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in a nativity that takes away our free agency, and subjects us to necessity and force. Neither sow, nor plant, nor go to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, nor engage in any work whatever! For whether you will or not, things will proceed according to the course of nativity! What need have we more of Prayer? And why should you deserve to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, if there be this nativity? For you will not then be responsible. And whence proceed the arts of life? Are these too from nativity? Yes, you say, and it is fated to one to become wise with labor. But can you show me one who has learned an art without labor? You cannot. It is not then from nativity but from labor that he derives his skill.</p>

<p>But why does a man who is corrupt and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> become rich, without inheriting it from his father, while another, amidst <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> labors, remains poor? For such are the questions they raise, always arguing upon <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and poverty, and never taking the case of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Now in this question talk not of that, but show me a man who has become bad, while he was striving to be good; or one that, without striving, has become good. For if Fate has any power, its power should be shown in the most important things; in <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, not in poverty and riches. Again you ask, why is one man sickly and another healthy? Why is one <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, another disgraced? Why does every thing succeed well with this man, while another meets with nothing but failure and impediments? Lay aside the notion of nativity, and you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Believe firmly that there is a God and a Providence, and all these things will be cleared up. <q>But I cannot,</q> you say, <q>conceive that there is a Providence, when there is such disorder. Can I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the good God gives <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> to the fornicator, the corrupt and dishonest man, and not to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>? How can I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this? For there must be facts to ground belief.</q> Well then, do these cases proceed from a nativity that was just, or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>? <q>Unjust,</q> you say. Who then made it? <q>Not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> you say, <q>it was unbegotten.</q> But how can the unbegotten produce these things? For they are contradictions. <q>These things are not then in any wise the works of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Shall we then enquire who made the earth, the sea, the heavens, the seasons? <q>Nativity,</q> you answer. Did nativity then produce in things inanimate such order and harmony, but in us, for whom these things were made, so much disorder? As if one, in building a house, should be careful to make it magnificent, but bestow not a thought upon his household. But who preserves the succession of the seasons? Who established the regular <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature? Who appointed the courses of day and night? These things are superior to any such nativity. <q>But these,</q> you say, <q>came to be of themselves.</q> And yet how can such a well-ordered system spring up of itself?</p>

<p><q>But whence,</q> you say, <q>come the rich, the healthy, the renowned, and how are some made rich by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, some by inheritance, some by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>? And why does God suffer the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to be prosperous?</q> We answer, Because the retribution, according to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> of each, does not take place here, but is reserved for hereafter. Show me any such thing taking place Then! <q>Well,</q> say you, <q>give me here, and I do not look for hereafter.</q>  But it is because you seek here, that you receive not. For if when earthly enjoyment is not within your reach, you seek present things so eagerly as to prefer them to future, what would you do if you were in possession of unmixed pleasure? God therefore shows you that these things are nothing, and indifferent; for if they were not indifferent, He would not bestow them on such men. You will own that it is a matter of indifference whether one be tall or short, black or white; so is it whether one be rich or poor. For, tell me, are not things necessary bestowed on all equally, as the capacity for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the distribution of spiritual gifts? If you understood aright the mercies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you would not complain of wanting worldly things, while you enjoyed these best gifts equally with others; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that equal distribution you would not desire superiority  in the rest. As if a servant enjoying from his master's bounty food, clothing, and lodging, and all other necessaries equally with his fellow-servants, should <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> himself upon having longer nails, or more hair upon his head; so it is for a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to be elated on account of those things, which he enjoys only for a time. For this reason it is, that God withdraws those things from us, to extinguish this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and transfer our affections from them to heaven. But nevertheless we do not learn wisdom. As if a child possessing a toy, should prefer it to things necessary, and his father, to lead him against his will to what was better for him, should deprive him of his toy; so God takes these things from us, that He may lead us to heaven. If you ask then why He permits the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to be rich, it is because they are not high in His esteem. And if the righteous too are rich, it is rather that He allows it to be, than that He makes them so. Now these things we say superficially, as to men not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. But our discourses would be unnecessary if you would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and take heed to the divine word, for that would teach you all things. And that you may understand that neither riches, nor health, nor <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, are anything, I can show you many, who, when they might gain <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, do not seek <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; when they might enjoy health, mortify their bodies; when they might rise to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, make it their aim to be despised. But there is no <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, who ever studied to be bad. Let us therefore desist from seeking things below, and let us seek heavenly things; for so we shall be able to attain them, and we shall enjoy <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> delights,  by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. To Whom with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, power, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now, and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
