<h1>Homily 1 on Hebrews</h1>

<h2>Hebrews 1:1-2</h2>

<p><q> <em><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who at sundry times and in various manners spoke in time past unto the fathers by the Prophets, has at the end of the days</em>  <em>spoken unto us by His Son whom He has appointed heir of all things, by whom also He made the worlds.</em></q></p>

<p>1. Truly, <q>where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did much more abound.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans 5:20</a></span> This at least the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> intimates here also, in the very beginning of his Epistle to the Hebrews. For since as it was likely that afflicted, worn out by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and judging of things thereby, they would think themselves worse off than all other men,&mdash; he shows that herein they had rather been made partakers of greater, even very exceeding, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; arousing the hearer at the very opening of his discourse. Wherefore he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who at sundry times and in various manners spoke in times past unto the fathers by the Prophets, has at the end of the days spoken unto us by His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</q></p>

<p>Why did he [<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>] not oppose <q>himself</q> to <q>the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a></q>? Certainly, he was much greater than they, inasmuch as a greater trust was committed to him. Yet he does not so. Why? First, to avoid speaking great things concerning himself. Secondly, because his hearers were not yet perfect. And thirdly, because he rather wished to exalt them, and to show that their superiority was great. As if he had said, What so great matter is it that He sent <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to our fathers? For to us [He has sent] His own only-begotten Son Himself.</p>

<p>And well did he begin thus, <q>At sundry times and in various manners,</q> for he points out that not even the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> themselves saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nevertheless, the Son saw Him. For the expressions, <q>at sundry times and in various manners</q> are the same as <q>in different ways.</q> <q>For I</q> (says He) <q>have multiplied visions, and used similitudes by the ministry of the Prophets.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/hos012.htm#verse10">Hosea 12:10</a></span> Wherefore the excellency consists not in this alone, that to them indeed <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were sent, but to us the Son; but that none of them saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the Only-begotten Son saw Him. He does not indeed at once assert this, but by what he says afterwards he establishes it, when he speaks concerning His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>; <q>For to which of the Angels said He, You are My Son,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse5">Hebrews 1:5</a></span>, and, <q>Sit on My right hand</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb001.htm#verse13">Hebrews 1:13</a></span></p>

<p>And look on his great wisdom. First he shows the superiority from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Then having established this as acknowledged, he declares that to them indeed He spoke by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but to us by the Only-begotten. Then [He spoke] to them by Angels, and this again he establishes, with good reason (for <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> also held converse with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>): yet even herein we have the superiority, inasmuch as the Master [spoke] to us, but to them servants, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, fellow-servants.</p>

<p>2. Well also said he, <q>at the end of the days,</q> for by this he both stirs them up and encourages them desponding of the future. For as he says also in another place, <q>The Lord is at hand, be careful for nothing</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse5">Philippians 4:5-6</a></span>, and again, <q>For now is our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> nearer than when we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse11">Romans 13:11</a></span>: so also here. What then is it which he says? That whoever is spent in the conflict, when he hears of the end thereof, recovers his breath a little, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is the end indeed of his labors, but the beginning of his rest.</p>

<p><q>Hath in the end of the days spoken unto us in [His] Son.</q> Behold again he uses the saying, <q>in [His] Son,</q>  for <q>through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q>  against those who assert that this phrase is proper to the Spirit.  Do you see that the [word] <q>in</q> is <q>through</q>? </p>

<p>And the expression, <q>In times past,</q> and this, <q>In the end of the days,</q> shadows forth some other meaning:&mdash; that when a long time had intervened, when we were on the edge of punishment, when the Gifts had failed, when there was no expectation of deliverance, when we were expecting to have less than all&mdash; then we have had more.</p>

<p>And see how considerately he has spoken it. For he said not, <q>Christ spoke</q> (albeit it was He who did speak), but inasmuch as their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were weak, and they were not yet able to hear the things concerning Christ, he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has spoken by Him.</q> What do you mean?  did God speak through the Son? Yes. What then? Is it thus you show the superiority? For here you have but pointed out that both the New and the Old [Covenants] are of One and the same: and that this superiority is not great. Wherefore he henceforth follows on upon this argument, saying, <q>He spoke unto us by [His] Son.</q></p>

<p>(Note, how <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> makes common <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and puts himself on a level with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, saying, He spoke <q>to us</q>: and yet He did not speak to him, but to the Apostles, and through them to the many. But he lifts them [the Hebrews] up, and declares that He spoke also to them. And as yet he does not at all reflect on the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For almost all to whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> spoke, were a kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and polluted <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. But as yet the discourse is not of these: but, hitherto of the gifts derived from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.)</p>

<p><q>Whom He appointed,</q> says he, <q>heir of all.</q> What is <q>whom He appointed heir of all</q>? He speaks here of the flesh [the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>]. As He also says in the second Psalm, <q>Ask of Me, and I will give You the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for Your inheritance.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa002.htm#verse8">Psalm 2:8</a></span> For no longer is <q>Jacob the portion of the Lord</q> nor <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His inheritance</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 32:9</a></span>, but all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: that is to say, He has made Him Lord of all: which Peter also said in the Acts, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has made Him both Lord and Christ.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse36">Acts 2:36</a></span> But he has used the name <q>Heir,</q> declaring two things: His proper sonship  and His indefeasible sovereignty. <q>Heir of all,</q> that is, of all the world.</p>

<p>3. Then again he brings back his discourse to its former point. <q>By whom also He made the worlds [the ages].</q>  Where are those who say, There was [a time] when He was not?</p>

<p>Then, using degrees of ascent, he uttered that which is far greater than all this, saying,</p>

<h2>Hebrews 1:3-4</h2>

<p><q>Who, (being the brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power,) when He had by Himself purged our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; being made  so much better than the Angels as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</q></p>

<p>O! The wisdom of the Apostle! Or rather, not the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit is the thing to wonder at. For surely he uttered not these things of his own <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nor in that way did he find his wisdom. (For whence could it be? From the knife, and the skins, or the workshop?) But it was from the working of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For his own understanding did not give birth to these thoughts, which was then so mean and slender as in nowise to surpass the baser sort; (for how could it, seeing it spent itself wholly on bargains and skins?) but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit shows forth its strength by whomsoever it will.</p>

<p>For just as one, wishing to lead up a little child to some lofty place, reaching up even to the top of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, does this gently and by degrees, leading him upwards by the steps from below&mdash;then when he has set him on high, and bidden him to gaze downwards, and sees him turning giddy and confused, and dizzy, taking hold of him, he leads him down to the lower stand, allowing him to take breath; then when he has recovered it, leads him up again, and again brings him down&mdash;just so did the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> likewise, both with the Hebrews and everywhere, having learned it from his Master. For even He also did so; sometimes He led His hearers up on high, and sometimes He brought them down, not allowing them to remain very long.</p>

<p>See him, then, even here&mdash; by how many steps he led them up, and placed them near the very summit of religion, and then or ever they grow giddy, and are seized with dizziness, how he leads them again lower down, and allowing them to take breath, says, <q>He spoke unto us by [His] Son,</q> <q>whom He appointed Heir of all things.</q>  For the name of Son is so far common. For where a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>  [Son] it is understood of, He is above all: but however that may be, for the present he proves that He is from above.</p>

<p>And see how he says it: <q>Whom He appointed,</q> says he, <q>heir of all things.</q> The phrase, <q>He appointed Heir,</q> is <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. Then he placed them on the higher step, adding, <q>by whom also He made the worlds.</q> Then on a higher still, and after which there is no other, <q>who being the brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the express image of His person.</q> Truly he has led them to unapproachable light, to the very brightness itself. And before they are blinded see how he gently leads them down again, saying, <q>and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty.</q> He does not simply say, <q>He sat down,</q> but <q>after the purifying, He sat down,</q> for he has touched on the Incarnation, and his utterance is again lowly.</p>

<p>Then again having said a little by the way (for he says, <q>on the right hand of the Majesty on high</q>), [he turns] again to what is lowly; <q>being made so much better than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,  as He has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.</q> Henceforward then he treats here of that which is according to the flesh, since the phrase <q>being made better</q> does not express His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,  (for that was not <q>made</q> but <q>begotten,</q>) but according to the flesh: for this was <q>made.</q> Nevertheless the discourse here is not about being called into  <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. But just as John says, <q>He that comes after me, is preferred before me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse15">John 1:15-30</a></span>, that is, higher in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and esteem; so also here, <q>being made so much better than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></q>&mdash; that is, higher in esteem and better and more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, <q>by how much He has obtained by inheritance a more excellent name than they.</q> Do you see that he is speaking of that which is according to the flesh? For this Name,  <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> ever had; He did not afterwards <q>obtain it by inheritance</q>; nor did He afterwards become <q>better than the Angels, when He had purged our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></q>; but He was always <q>better,</q> and better without all comparison.  For this is spoken of Him according to the flesh.</p>

<p>So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> it is our way also, when we talk of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, to speak things both high and low. Thus, when we say, <q>Man is nothing,</q> <q>Man is earth,</q> <q>Man is ashes,</q> we call the whole by the worse part. But when we say, <q>Man is an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> animal,</q> and <q>Man is rational, and of kin to those on high,</q> we call again the whole by the better part. So also, in the case of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, sometimes <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> discourses from the less and sometimes from the better; wishing both to establish the economy, and also to teach about the incorruptible nature.</p>

<p>4. Since then <q>He has purged our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> let us continue pure; and let us receive no stain, but preserve the beauty which He has implanted in us, and His comeliness undefiled and pure, <q>not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians 5:27</a></span> Even little <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are <q>a spot and a wrinkle,</q> such a thing, I mean, as Reproach, Insult, Falsehood.</p>

<p>Nay, rather not even are these small, but on the contrary very great: yea so great as to deprive a man even of the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. How, and in what manner? <q>He that calls his brother fool, is in danger</q> (He says) <q>of hellfire.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a></span> But if it be so with him who calls a man <q>fool,</q> which seems to be the slightest of all things, and rather mere children's talk; what sentence of punishment will not he incur, who calls him malignant and crafty and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, and casts at him ten thousand other reproaches? What more fearful than this?</p>

<p>Now suffer, I beseech you, the word [of exhortation].  For if he that <q>does</q> [anything] to <q>one of the least, does it to Him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse40">Matthew 25:40</a></span>, and he that <q>does it not to one of the least does it not to Him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse45">Matthew 25:45</a></span>, how is it not the same also in the matter of good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking? He that reviles his brother, reviles God: and he that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> his brother, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> God. Let us train therefore our tongue to speak good words. For <q>refrain,</q> it is said, <q>your tongue from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa033.htm#verse13">Psalm 34:13</a></span> For God gave it not that we should speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that we should revile, that we should <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> one another; but to sing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> to God withal, to speak those things which <q>give <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the hearers</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse29">Ephesians 4:29</a></span>, things for edification, things for profit.</p>

<p>Have you spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of a man? What is your gain, entangling yourself in mischief together with him? For you have obtained the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of a slanderer. For there is not any, no not any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which stops at him that suffers it, but it includes the doer also. As for instance, the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> person seems indeed to plot against another, but himself first reaps the fruit of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wasting and wearing himself away, and being <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The cheat deprives another of his money; yea and himself too of men's good will: and causes himself to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spoken of by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> is much better than money, for the one it is not easy to wash out, whereas it is easy to gain possession of the other. Or rather, the absence of the one does no hurt to him that wants it; but the absence of the other makes you reproached and ridiculed, and an object of enmity and warfare to all.</p>

<p>The passionate man again first punishes and tears himself in pieces, and then him with whom he is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</p>

<p>Just so the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaker disgraces first himself and then him who is evil-spoken of: or, it may be, even this has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> beyond his power, and while he departs with the credit of a foul and detestable kind of person, he causes the other to be loved the more. For when a man hearing a bad name given him, does not requite the giver in the same kind, but praises and admires, he does not praise the other, but himself. For I before observed that, as <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against our neighbors first touch those who de  vise the mischief, so also good works done towards our neighbors, gladden first those who do them. The parent either of good, or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> reaps the fruit of it first himself. And just as water, whether it be brackish or sweet, fills the vessels of those who resort to it, but lessens not the fountain which sends it forth; so surely also, both <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, from whatever person they proceed, prove either his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> or his ruin.</p>

<p>So far as to the things of this world; but what speech may recount the things of that world, either the goods or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? There is none. For as to the blessings, they surpass all thought, not speech only; for their opposites are expressed indeed in terms familiar to us. For fire, it is said, is there, and darkness, and bonds, and a worm that never dies. But this represents not only the things which are spoken of, but others more intolerable. And to convince you, consider at once this first: if it be fire, how is it also darkness? Do you see how that fire is more intolerable than this? For it has no light. If it be fire, how is it forever burning? Do you see how something more intolerable than this happens? For it is not quenched. Yea, therefore it is called unquenchable. Let us then consider how great a misery it must be, to be forever burning, and to be in darkness, and to utter unnumbered groanings, and to gnash the teeth, and not even to be heard. For if here any one of those ingeniously brought up, should he be cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, speaks of the mere ill savor, and the being laid in darkness, and the being bound with murderers, as more intolerable than any death: think what it is when we are burning with the murderers of the whole world, neither seeing nor being seen, but in so vast a multitude thinking that we are alone. For the darkness and gloom does not allow our distinguishing those who are near to us, but each will burn as if he were thus suffering alone. Moreover, if darkness of itself afflicts and terrifies our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, how then will it be when together with the darkness there are likewise so great pains and burnings?</p>

<p>Wherefore I entreat you to be ever revolving these things with yourselves, and to submit to the pain of the words, that we may not undergo the punishment of the things. For assuredly, all these things shall be, and those whose doings have deserved those chambers of torture no man shall rescue, not father, nor mother, nor brother. <q>For a brother redeems not,</q> He says; <q>shall a man redeem?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa048.htm#verse7">Psalm 49:7</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span>, though he have much confidence, though he have great power with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is He Himself who rewards every one according to his works, and upon these depends our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or punishment.</p>

<p>Let us make then to ourselves <q>friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke 16:9</a></span>, that is: Let us give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; let us exhaust our possessions upon them, that so we may exhaust that fire: that we may quench it, that we may have boldness there. For there also it is not they who receive us, but our own work: for that it is not simply their being our friends which can save us, learn from what is added. For why did He not say, <q>Make to yourselves friends, that they may receive you into their everlasting habitations,</q> but added also the manner? For saying, <q>of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness,</q> He points out that we must make friends of them by means of our possessions, showing that mere friendship will not protect us, unless we have good works, unless we spend righteously the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> unrighteously gathered.</p>

<p>Moreover, this our discourse, of Almsgiving I mean, fits not only the rich, but also the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>. Yea even if there be any person who supports himself by begging, even for him is this word. For there is no one, so poverty-stricken, however exceeding poor he may be, as not to be able to provide <q>two mites.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse2">Luke 21:2</a></span> &nbsp;It is therefore possible that a person giving a small sum from small means, should surpass those who have large possessions and give more; as that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> did. For not by the measure of what is given, but by the means and willingness of the givers is the extent of the alms-deed estimated. In all cases the will is needed, in all, a right disposition; in all, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards God. If with this we do all things, though having little we give little, God will not turn away His face, but will receive it as great and admirable: for He regards the will, not the gifts: and if He see that to be great, He assigns His decrees and judges accordingly, and makes them partakers of His everlasting benefits.</p>

<p>Which may God grant us all to obtain, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, power, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and for ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
