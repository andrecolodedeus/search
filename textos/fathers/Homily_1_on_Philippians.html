<h1>Homily 1 on Philippians</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Philippians 1:1, 2</span>  </p>

<p><q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, fellow-Bishops  and Deacons: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>Here, as writing to those of equal <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, he does not set down his rank of Teacher, but another, and that a great one. And what is that? He calls himself a <q>servant,</q> and not an Apostle. For great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is this rank too, and the sum of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, to be a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and not merely to be called so. <q>The servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a free man in respect to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and being a genuine servant, he is not a servant to any other, since he would not be Christ's servant, but by halves. And in again writing to the Romans also, he says, <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse1">Romans 1:1</a></span> But writing to the Corinthians and to Timothy he calls himself an <q>Apostle.</q> On what account then is this? Not because they were superior to Timothy. Far from it. But rather he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> them, and shows them attention, beyond all others to whom he wrote. For he also bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in them. For besides, there indeed he was about to order many things, and therefore assumed his rank as an Apostle. But here he gives them no injunctions but such as they could perceive of themselves.</p>

<p><q>To the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi.</q> Since it was likely that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> too would call themselves <q><a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a></q> from the first oracle, when  they were called a <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people, a people for God's own possession</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse6">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>, etc.</span>; for this reason he added, <q>to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> For these alone are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and those hence-forward profane. <q>To the fellow-Bishops  and Deacons.</q> What is this? Were there several Bishops of one city? Certainly not; but he called the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> so. For then they still interchanged the titles, and the Bishop was called a Deacon.  For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in writing to Timothy, he said, <q>Fulfil your ministry,</q> when he was a Bishop. For that he was a Bishop appears by his saying to him, <q>Lay hands hastily on no man.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse22">1 Timothy 5:22</a></span> And again, <q>Which was given you with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse14">1 Timothy 4:14</a></span> Yet <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> would not have laid hands on a Bishop. And again, in writing to Titus, he says, <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I left you in Crete, that you should appoint elders  in every city, as I gave you charge. If any man is blameless, the husband of one wife</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse5">Titus 1:5-6</a></span>; which he says of the Bishop.  And after saying this, he adds immediately, <q>For the Bishop must be blameless, as God's steward, not self willed.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse7">Titus 1:7</a></span> So then, as I said, both the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a> were of old called Bishops and Deacons of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the Bishops <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">Presbyters</a>; and hence even now many Bishops write, <q>To my fellow-Presbyter,</q> and, <q>To my fellow-Deacon.</q> But otherwise the specific name is distinctly appropriated to each, the Bishop and the Presbyter. <q>To the fellow-Bishops,</q> he says, and Deacons,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse2">Ver. 2</a>. <q>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>How is it that though he nowhere else writes to the Clergy, not in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, nor in <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>, nor in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, nor anywhere, but in general, to <q>all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, the beloved,</q> yet here he writes to the Clergy? Because it was they that sent, and bare fruit, and it was they that dispatched Epaphroditus to him.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse3">Ver. 3</a>. <q>I thank my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he says, <q>upon all my remembrance of you.</q></p>

<p>He said in another of his writings, <q>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and not with grief.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse17">Hebrews 13:17</a></span> If then the <q>grief</q> be due to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, the doing it <q>with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a></q> would be due to their advancement. As often as I remember you, I glorify God. But this he does from his being conscious of many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in them. I both glorify, he says, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. I do not, be<a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you have advanced unto <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, cease <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for you. But <q>I thank my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he says, <q>upon all my remembrance of you,</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse4">Ver. 4</a>. <q>Always in every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of mine for you all making request also with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q></p>

<p><q>Always,</q>  not only while I am <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>. <q>With <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q> For it is possible to do this with grief too, as when he says elsewhere, <q>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 2:4</a></span></p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse5">Ver. 5</a>. <q>For your fellowship in furtherance of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> from the first day even until now.</q></p>

<p>Great is that he here witnesses of them, and very great, and what one might have witnessed of Apostles and Evangelists. You did not, because you were entrusted with one city, he says, care for that only, but you leave nothing undone to be sharers of my labors, being everywhere at hand and working with me, and taking part in my preaching. It is not once, or the second, or third time, but always, from the time ye <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> until now, you have assumed the readiness of Apostles. Behold how those indeed that were in Rome turned away from him;  for hear him saying, <q>This you know, that all that are in Asia turned away from me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti001.htm#verse15">2 Timothy 1:15</a></span> And again, <q>Demas forsook me</q>: and <q>at my first defence no one took my part.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse10">2 Timothy 4:10-16</a></span> But these, although absent, shared in his tribulations, both sending men to him, and ministering to him according to their ability, and leaving out nothing at all. And this ye do not now only, says he, but always, in every way assisting me. So then it is a <q>fellowship in furtherance of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> For when one preaches, and you wait on the preacher, you share his crowns. Since even in the contests that are without, the crown is not only for him that strives, but for the trainer, and the attendant, and all that help to prepare the athlete. For they that strengthen him, and recover him, may fairly participate in his victory. And in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> too, not only he that wins the prize of valor, but all they too that attend him, may fairly claim a share in the trophies, and partake of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as having shared in his conflict by their attendance on him. For it avails not a little to wait on <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, but very much. For it makes us sharers in the rewards that are laid up for them. Thus; suppose some one has given up great possessions for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, continually devotes himself to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, practices great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and even to words, and even to thoughts, and even in everything observes extreme strictness. It is open to you too, even without showing such strictness, to have a share in the rewards that are laid up for him for these things. How? If you aid him both in word and deed. If you encourage him both by supplying his needs, and by doing him every possible service. For then the smoother of that rugged path will be yourself. So then if you admire those in the deserts that have adopted the angelic life, those in the churches that practice the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> with them; if you admire, and are grieved that you are far behind them; ye may, in another way, share with them, by waiting on them, and aiding them. For indeed this too is of God's lovingkindness, to bring those that are less <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>,  and are not able to undertake the hard and rugged and strict life, to bring, I say, even those, by another way, into the same rank with the others. And this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> means by <q>fellowship.</q> They give a share to us, he means, in carnal things, and we give a share to them in spiritual things. For if God for little and worthless things grants the kingdom, His servants too, for little and material things, give a share in spiritual things: or rather it is He that gives both the one and the other by means of them. You can not fast, nor be alone, nor lie on the ground, nor watch all night? Yet may thou gain the reward of all these things, if you go about the matter another way, by attending on him that labors in them, and refreshing and anointing him constantly, and lightening the pains of these works. He, for his part, stands fighting and taking blows. Do thou wait on him when he returns from the combat, receive him in your arms, wipe off the sweat, and refresh him; comfort, soothe, restore his wearied <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If we will but minister to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with such readiness, we shall be partakers of their rewards. This Christ also tells us. <q>Make to yourselves friends by means of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness, that they may receive you into their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> tabernacles.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke 16:9</a></span> Do you see that they have become sharers? <q>From the first day,</q> he says, <q>even until now.</q> And <q>I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a></q> not only for what is past, but also for the future; for from the past I guess that too.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse6">Ver. 6</a>. <q>Being confident of this very thing, that He which began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>See how he also teaches them to be unassuming. For since he had witnessed a great thing of them, that they may not feel as men are apt to do, he presently teaches them to refer both the past and the future to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. How? By saying, not, <q>Being confident that as you began you will also finish,</q> but what? <q>He which began a good work in you will perfect it.</q> He did not rob them of the achievement, (for he said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for your fellowship,</q> clearly as if making it their act,) nor did he call their good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> solely their own, but primarily of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For I am confident,</q> says he, <q>that He which began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> That is, God will. And it is not about yourselves, he implies, but about those descending from you that I feel thus. And indeed it is no small praise, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should work in one. For if He is <q>no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>,</q> as indeed He is none, but is looking to our purpose  when He aids us in good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, it is evident that we are agents in drawing Him to us; so that even in this view he did not rob them of their praise. Since if His in working were indiscriminate, there would have been nothing to hinder but that even Heathens and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> might have Him working in them, that is, if He moved us like logs and stones, and required not our part. So that in saying <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will perfect it,</q> this also again is made their praise, who have drawn to them the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that He aids them in going beyond <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. And in another way also a praise, as that <q>such are your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that they cannot be of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but require the divine impulse.</q> But if God will perfect, then neither shall there be much labor, but it is right to be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, for that they shall easily accomplish all, as being assisted by Him.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse7">Ver. 7</a>. <q>Even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, you all are partakers with me of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q></p>

<p>Greatly still does he show here his longing desire, in that he had them in his heart; and in the very <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and though bound, he remembered the Philippians. And it is not a little to the praise of these men, since it is not of prejudice that this Saint conceived his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but of judgment, and right reasons. So that to be loved of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> so earnestly is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of one's being something great and admirable. <q>And in the defense,</q>  he says, <q>and confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> And what wonder if he had them when in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, since not even at the moment of going before the tribunal to make my defense, he says, did ye slip from my memory. For so imperial a thing is spiritual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that it gives way to no season, but ever keeps hold of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of him who loves, and allows no trouble or pain to overcome that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For as in the case of the Babylonian furnace, when so vast a flame was raised, it was a dew to those blessed Children. So too does friendship occupying the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of one who loves, and who pleases <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, shake off every flame, and produce a marvelous dew.</p>

<p><q>And in the confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>,</q> he says. So then his bonds were a confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and a defense. And most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> so. How? For if he had shunned bonds, he might have been thought a deceiver; but he that endures every thing, both bonds and affliction, shows that he suffers this for no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reason, but for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who rewards. For no one would have been willing to die, or to incur such great risks, no one would have chosen to come into collision with such a king,  I mean <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, unless he looked to another far greater King. Truly a <q>confirmation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a></q> were his bonds. See how he more than succeeded in turning all things to their opposite. For what they supposed to be a weakness and a detraction, that he calls a confirmation; and had this not taken place, there had been a weakness. Then he shows that his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was not of prejudice, but of judgment. Why? I have you (in my heart), he says, in my bonds, and in my defense, because of your being <q>partakers of my <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> What is this? Was this the <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></q> of the Apostle, to be bound, to be driven about, to suffer ten thousand <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? Yes. For He says, <q>My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a></span> <q>Wherefore,</q> says he, <q>I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries.</q> Since then I see you in your actions giving <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and being partakers of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and that with readiness, I reasonably suppose thus much. For I that have had trial of you, and more than any have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> you, and your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; how that even when so distant from us, you strive not to be wanting to us in our troubles, but to partake in our trials for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel's</a> sake, and to take no less share than myself, who am engaged in the combat, far off as you are; am doing but <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in witnessing to these things.</p>

<p>And why did he not say <q>partakers,</q> but <q>partakers with me</q> ? I myself too, he means, share with another, that I may be a partaker of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; that is, that I may share in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things laid up for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.  And the wonder indeed is that they were all so minded; for he says that <q>ye all are fellow-partakers of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> From these beginnings, then, I am confident that such ye will be even to the end. For it cannot be that so bright a commencement should be quenched, and fail, but it points to  great results.</p>

<p>Since then it is possible also in other ways  to partake of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and of trials, and of tribulations, let us also, I beseech you, be partakers. How many of those who stand here, yea, rather all, would fain share with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come! It is in your power if you are willing, on behalf of those who have succeeded to his ministry, when they suffer any hardship for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, to take their part and succor them. Have you seen your brother in trial? Hold out a hand! Have you seen your teacher in conflict? Stand by him! But, says one, there is no one like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>! now for disdain! now for criticism! So there is no one like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Well, I grant it. But, <q>He that receives,</q> says He, <q>a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the name of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, shall receive a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> reward.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse41">Matthew 10:41</a></span> For was it for this that these were <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, that they co&ouml;perated with <em><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?</em> Not for this, but because they co&ouml;perated with one who had undertaken the preaching. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> for this, that he suffered these things for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake.</p>

<p>There is indeed no one like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. No, not even but a little approaching to that blessed one. But the preaching is the same as it was then.</p>

<p>And not only in his bonds did they have fellowship with him, but also from the beginning. For hear him saying, <q>And ye yourselves also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, you Philippians, that in the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, no Church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving, but you only.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse15">Philippians 4:15</a></span> And even apart from trials, the teacher has much labor, watching, toiling in the word, teaching, complaints, accusations, imputations, envyings. Is this a little matter, to bear ten thousand tongues, when one might have but one's own anxieties? Alas! What shall I do? For I am in a strait between two things. I long to urge you on and encourage you to the alliance and succor of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest some one should suspect another thing, that I say this not for your sakes, but for theirs. But <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not for their sakes I say these things, but for your own. And if you are willing to attend, I convince you by my very words; the gain is not equal to you and to them. For you, if you give, will give those things from which, willing or unwilling, you must soon after part, and give place to others; but what you receive is great and far more abundant. Or, are you not so disposed, that in giving you will receive? For if you are not so disposed, I do not even wish you to give. So far am I from making a speech for them! Except one have first so disposed himself, as receiving rather than giving, as gaining ten thousand fold, as benefited rather than a benefactor, let him not give. If as one granting a favor to the receiver, let him not give. For this is not so much my care, that the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> may be supported. For even if you give not, another will give. So that what I want is this, that you may have a relief from your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But he that gives not so will have no relief. For it is not giving that is doing <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, but the doing it with readiness; the rejoicing, the feeling grateful to him that receives. For, <q>not grudgingly,</q> says he, <q>or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 9:7</a></span> Except then one so give, let him not give: for that is loss, not <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. If then ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you will gain, not they, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your gain becomes greater.  For as for them the body is fed, but your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is approved; for them, not one of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is forgiven when they receive, but for you, the more part of your offenses is removed. Let us then share with them in their great prizes.  When men adopt kings they do not think they give more than they receive. Adopt thou Christ, and you shall have great security. Will you also share with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Why do I say <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when it is Christ that receives?</p>

<p>But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all is for your sakes that I say and do, and not of care for the comfort of others, if there is any of the rulers of the church that lives in abundance and wants nothing, though he be a saint, give not, but prefer to him one that is in want, though he be not so admirable. And wherefore? Because Christ too so wills, as when He says, <q>If you make a supper or a dinner, call not your friends, neither your kinsmen, but the maimed, the lame, the blind, that cannot recompense you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse12">Luke 14:12</a></span> For it is not indiscriminately that one should pay such attentions, but to the hungry, but to the thirsty, but to those who need clothing, but to strangers, but to those who from riches have been reduced to poverty.  For He said not simply, <q>I was fed,</q> but <q>I was an hungered,</q> for, <q>You saw me an hungered,</q> He says, <q>and fed me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse35">Matthew 25:35</a></span> Twofold is the claim, both that he is a saint and that he is hungry. For if he that is simply hungry ought to be fed, much more when he is a saint too that is hungry. If then he is a saint, but not in need, give not; for this were no gain. For neither did Christ enjoin it; or rather, neither is he a saint  that is in abundance and receives. Do you see that it is not for filthy lucre that these things have been said to you, but for your profit? Feed the hungry, that you may not feed the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. He, eating of what is yours, sanctifies also what remains. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse41">Luke 11:41</a></span> Think how the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> maintained Elias; and she did not more feed than she was fed: she did not more give than receive. This now also takes place in a much greater thing. For it is not a <q>barrel of meal,</q> nor <q>a cruse of oil</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#verse14">1 Kings 17:14</a></span>, but what? <q>An hundred fold, and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21-29</a></span>, is the recompense for such&mdash; the mercy of God you become, the spiritual food; a pure leaven. She was a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, famine was pressing, and none of these things hindered her. Children too she had, and not even so was she withheld. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#verse12">1 Kings 17:12</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has become equal to her that cast in the two mites. She said not to herself, <q>What shall I receive from this man? He stands in need of me. If he had any power he had not hungered, he had broken the drought, he had not been subject to like sufferings. Perchance he too offends God.</q> None of these things did she think of. Do you see how great a good it is to do well with simplicity, and not to be over curious about the person benefited? If she had chosen to be curious she would have <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>; she would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. So, too, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, if he had chosen to be curious, would not have received <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For it cannot, indeed it cannot be, that one who is exceeding nice in these matters, should ever meet with them. No, such an one usually lights on <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a>; and how that is, I will tell you. The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man is not desirous to appear <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and does not clothe himself in show, and is likely to be rejected. But the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a>, as he makes a business of it, puts on a deal of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that is hard to see through. So that while he who does good, even to those who seem not <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, will fall in with those who are so, he who seeks out those who are thought to be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, will often fall in with those who are not so. Wherefore, I beseech you, let us do all things in simplicity. For let us even suppose that he is an <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> that comes; you are not bidden to be curious about this. For, <q>Give,</q> says he, <q>to every one that asks you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse30">Luke 6:30</a></span>; and, <q>Forbear not to redeem him that is to be slain.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse11">Proverbs 24:11</a></span> Yet most of those that are slain suffer this for some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they are convicted of; still he says, <q>Forbear not.</q> For in this shall we be like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thus shall we be admired, and shall obtain those <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> blessings, which may we all be thought worthy of, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, with whom, to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, power, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and forever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
