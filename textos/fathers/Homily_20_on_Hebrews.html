<h1>Homily 20 on Hebrews</h1>

<h2>Hebrews 10:26-27</h2>

<p><q> <em>For if we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> willfully, after we have received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there remains no more</em>  <em><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation</em>  <em>which shall devour the adversaries.</em></q></p>

<p>1. Trees which have been planted, and have had the advantage of all other care, and the hands and the labors of the cultivator, and yet yield no return for the labors, are pulled up by the roots, and handed over to the fire. So somewhat of this kind takes place also in the case of our Illumination.  &nbsp;For when Christ has planted us, and we have enjoyed the watering of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and then show no fruit; fire, even that of Hell, awaits us, and flame unquenchable.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> therefore having exhorted them to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and to bringing forth the fruit of good works, and having urged them from the kindlier [considerations] (What are these? That we have an entrance into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies, <q>the new way which He has inaugurated for us.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse20">Hebrews 10:20</a></span>), does the same again from the more gloomy ones, speaking thus. For having said, <q>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting  one another, and so much the more, as you see the day approaching</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse25">Hebrews 10:25</a></span>, this being sufficient for consolation, he added, <q>For if we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> willfully after we have received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> There is need, he means, of good works, yea, very great need, <q>For if we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> willfully after we have received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there remains no more <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> You were cleansed; you were set free from the charges against you, you have become a son. If then thou return to your former vomit, there awaits you on the other hand excommunication and fire and whatever such things there are. For there is no second <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<p>2. At this place we are again assailed by those who take away repentance,  and by those who delay to come to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The one saying, that it is not safe for them to come to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, since there is no second remission: And the other asserting that it is not safe to impart the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>  to those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, if there is no second remission.</p>

<p>What shall we say then to them both? That he does not take away repentance, nor the propitiation through repentance, nor does he thrust away and cast down with despair the fallen. He is not thus an enemy of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but what? He takes away the second Washing. For he did not say, no more  is there repentance, or no more is there remission, but <q>no more</q> is there a <q><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q> that is, there is no more a second Cross.  For this is what he means by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. <q>For by one <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q> he says, <q>He has perfected forever them that are sanctified</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse14">Hebrews 10:14</a></span>; not like the Jewish [<a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>.]. For this reason he has treated so much throughout concerning the Sacrifice, that it is one, even one; not wishing to show this only, that herein it differed from the Jewish [<a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>], but also to make [men] more steadfast, so that they might no longer expect another <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Jewish law</a>.</p>

<p><q>For,</q> says he, <q>if we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> willfully.</q> See how he is disposed to pardon. He says, <q>if we <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> willfully,</q> so that there is pardon for those [who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>] not willfully. <q>After the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q>: He either means, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or of all doctrines. <q>There remains no more <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> but what? <q>A certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries.</q> By <q>Adversaries</q> he means not the unbelievers, but those also who do what is against <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; or [else he means] that the same fire shall receive them of the household also, which [receives] <q>the adversaries.</q> Then expressing its devouring nature, he says, as if giving it life, <q>fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries.</q> For as a wild beast when irritated and very fierce and savage, would  not rest till it could lay hold on some one and eat him up; so also that fire, like one goaded by indignation, whatever it can lay hold of does not let go, but devours and tears it to pieces.</p>

<p>3. Next he adds also the reason of the threat, that it is on good grounds, that it is just; for this contributes to confidence, when we show that it is just.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 10:28</h2>

<p>For, he says, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse28">Hebrews 10:28</a></span> <q>He that has despised <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> law dies without mercy, under two or three witnesses.</q> <q>Without mercy,</q> he says; so that there is no pardon, no pity there although the law is of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; for he ordained the most of it.</p>

<p>What is <q>under two or three</q>? If two or three bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, he means, they immediately suffered punishment.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 10:29</h2>

<p>If then under the Old [Covenant], when the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> is set at nought, there is so great punishment, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse29">Hebrews 10:29</a></span> <q>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and has counted the blood of the covenant an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> [a common] thing, and has done despite unto the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?</q></p>

<p>And how does a man <q>tread under foot the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></q>? When partaking of Him in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> (he would say) he has wrought <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has he not trodden Him under foot? Has he not despised Him? For just as we make no account of those who are trodden under foot, so also, they who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> have made no account of Christ; and so they have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. You are  become the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and givest you yourself to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, so that he treads you under foot.</p>

<p><q>And accounted the blood a common thing,</q> he says. What is <q>common</q>? It is <q>unclean,</q> or the having nothing beyond other things.</p>

<p><q>And done despite unto the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> For he that accepts not a benefit, does despite to the benefactor. He made you a son: and you wish to become a slave. He came to dwell with you, and you bring in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> imaginations to Him. Christ wished to stay with you: and you tread Him down by surfeiting, by <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>.</p>

<p>Let us listen, whoever partake of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> unworthily: let us listen, whoever approach that Table unworthily. <q>Give not</q> (He says) <q>that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unto the dogs, lest in time they trample them under their feet</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew 7:6</a></span>, that is, lest they despise, lest they repudiate [them]. Yet he did not say this, but what was more fearful than this. For he constrains their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by what is fearful. For this also is adapted to convert, no less than consolation. And at the same time he shows both the difference, and the chastisement, and sets forth the judgment upon them, as though it were an evident matter. <q>Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy?</q> Here also he appears to me to hint at the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 10:30-31</h2>

<p>4. Next he adds testimony, saying, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse30">Hebrews 10:30-31</a></span> <q>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God.</q> <q>For</q> it is written: <q>Vengeance [belongs] unto Me, I will recompense, says the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge His people.</q> <q>Let us fall,</q> it is said, <q>into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir002.htm#verse18">Sirach 2:18</a></span>  But if you repent not, you shall <q>fall into the hands of</q> God: that is fearful: it is nothing, to <q>fall into the hands of men.</q> When, he means, we see any man punished here, let us not be terrified at the things present, but shudder at the things to come. <q>For according to His mercy, so is His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q>  And, <q>His indignation will rest upon sinners.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir005.htm#verse6">Sirach 5:6</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time too he hints at something else. For <q>Vengeance [belongs] unto Me,</q> he says, <q>I will recompense.</q> This is said in regard to their enemies, who are doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, not to those who are suffering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Here he is consoling them too, all but saying, God abides for ever and lives, so that even if they receive not [their reward] now, they will receive it hereafter. They ought to groan, not we: for we indeed shall fall into their hands, but they into the hands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For neither is it the sufferer who suffers the ill, but he that does it; nor is it he who receives a benefit that is benefited, but the benefactor.</p>

<p>5. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> then these things, let us be patient as to suffering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, forward as to kindnesses. And this will be, if we think lightly of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. He that has stripped himself of those affections, is of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> most generous, and more <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> even than he who wears the purple. Do you see not how many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> come through money? I do not say how many through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, but merely by our attachment to these things. For instance, if a man has lost his money, he leads a life more wretched than any death. Why do you grieve, O man? Why do you weep? Because God has delivered You from excessive watching? Because thou dost not sit trembling and fearful? Again, if any one chain you to a treasure, commanding you to sit there perpetually, and to keep watch for other people's goods, you are grieved, you are disgusted; and do you, after you have bound yourself with most grievous chains, grieve when you are delivered from the slavery?  Truly sorrows and joys are [matters] of fancy.  For we guard them as if we had another's.</p>

<p>Now my discourse is for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> often has a garment woven with gold, and this she shakes, wraps up in linen, keeps with care, trembles for it, and has no enjoyment of it. For either she dies, or she becomes a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. Or, even if none of these things happen, yet from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest wearing it out by continual use, she should deprive herself of it, she deprives herself of it in another way, by sparing it. But she passes it on [you say] to another. But neither is this clear: and even if she should pass it on, the other again will also use it in the same way. And if any one will search their houses, he will find that the most costly garments and other choice things, are tended with special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as if they were living masters. For she does not use them <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a>, but fears and trembles, driving away moths and the other things that are wont to eat them, and laying most of them in perfumes and spices, nor permitting all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be counted worthy of the sight of them, but oftentimes carefully putting them in order herself with her husband.</p>

<p>Tell me: did not <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> with reason call <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> <q><a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a></q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians 3:5</a></span> For these show as great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to their garments, their gold, as they to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</p>

<p>6. How long shall we stir up the mire? How long shall we be fixed to the clay and the brickmaking? For as they toiled for the King of the Egyptians, so do we also toil for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and are scourged with far more grievous stripes. For by how much the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> surpasses the body, by so much does anxiety the weals of scourging. We are scourged every day, we are full of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in anxiety, in trembling. But if we will groan, if we will look up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He sends to us, not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, but His own Word, and compunction. When this [word] has come, and taken hold of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, He will free from the bitter slavery, He will bring us forth out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from unprofitable and vain <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, from slavery which brings no gain. For they indeed went forth after having at least received golden [ornaments], the wages for building, but we [receive] nothing: and would it were nothing. For indeed we also receive, not golden ornaments, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and chastisements and punishments.</p>

<p>Let us then learn to be made use of, let us learn to be spitefully treated; this is the part of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Let us think lightly of golden raiment, let us think lightly of money, that we may not think lightly of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Let us think lightly of money and not think lightly of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For this is chastised, this is punished: those things remain here, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> departs yonder. Why, tell me, do you cut yourself to pieces, without perceiving it?</p>

<p>7. These things I say to the overreaching. And it is well to say also to those who are overreached. Bear their overreachings generously; they are ruining themselves, not you. You indeed they defraud of your money, but they strip themselves of the good will and help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And he that is stripped of that, though he clothe himself with the whole <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of the world, is of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> most poor: and so he who is the poorest of all, if he have this, is the wealthiest of all. For <q>the Lord</q> (it is said) <q>is my shepherd, and I shall lack nothing.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa022.htm#verse1">Psalm 23:1</a></span></p>

<p>Tell me now, if you had had a husband, a great and admirable man, who thoroughly loved you and cared for you, and then <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">knew</a> that he would live always, and not die before you, and would give you all things to enjoy in security, as your own: would you then have wished to possess anything? Even if you had been stripped of all, would you not have thought yourself the richer for this?</p>

<p>Why then do you grieve? Because you have no property? But consider that you have had the occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> taken away. But is it because you had [property] and have been deprived of it? But you have acquired the good will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And how have I acquired it (you say)? He has said, <q>Wherefore do ye not rather suffer wrong?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 6:7</a></span> He has said, <q>Blessed are they who bear all things with thankfulness.</q>  Consider therefore how great good will you will enjoy, if you show forth those things by [your] works. For one thing only is required from us, <q>in all things to give thanks</q> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and [then] we have all things in abundance. I mean, for instance: have you lost ten thousand pounds of gold? Forthwith give thanks unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you have acquired ten times ten thousand, by that word and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>8. For tell me when do you account Job blessed? When he had so many camels, and flocks, and herds, or when he uttered that saying: <q>The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job 1:21</a></span> Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> causes us losses, not that he may take away our goods only, for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that is nothing, but that through them he may compel us to utter some <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. So in the case of the blessed Job too, he did not strive after this only, to make him poor, but also to make him a blasphemer. At any rate, when he had stripped him of every  thing, observe what he says to him through his wife, <q>Say some word against the Lord, and die.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse9">Job 2:9</a></span> And yet, O accursed one, you had stripped him of everything. 'But' (he says) 'this is not what I was striving for; for I have not yet accomplished that for which I did all. I was striving to deprive him of God's help: for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I deprived him of his goods too. This is what I wish, that other is nothing. If this be not gained, he not only has not been injured at all, but has even been benefited.' You see that even that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how great is the loss in this matter?</p>

<p>And see him plotting the treachery through the wife. Hear this, you husbands, as many as have wives that are fond of money, and compel you to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> God. Call Job to mind. But let us see, if it please you, his great moderation, how he silenced her. <q>Wherefore</q> (he says) <q>have you spoken as one of the foolish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> [speaks]?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse10">Job 2:10</a></span> Of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications corrupt good manners</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1 Corinthians 15:33</a></span>, at all times indeed, but particularly in calamities: then they who give <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> advice have strength. For if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is even of itself prone to impatience, how much more, when there is also an adviser. Is it not thrust into a pit? A wife is a great good, as also a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For because a wife is a great [good], observe from what point he [<a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>] wishes to break through the strong wall. 'The depriving him of his property' (he says) 'did not take him; the loss has produced no great effect.' Therefore he says, 'If indeed he will curse you to your face.' <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse5">Job 2:5</a></span> You see whither he was aspiring. </p>

<p>If then we bear [losses] thankfully, we shall recover even these things; and if we should not recover them, our reward will be greater. For when he had wrestled nobly, then God restored to him these things also. When He had shown the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that it is not for these things that he serves Him, then He restored them also to him.</p>

<p>9. For such is He. When God sees that we are not riveted to things of this life, then He gives them to us. When He sees that we set a higher value on things spiritual, then He also bestows on us things carnal. But not first, lest we should break away from things spiritual: and to spare us He does not give carnal things, to keep us away from them, even against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>.</p>

<p>Not so (you say) but if I receive [them], I am satisfied, and am the more thankful. It is false, O man, for then especially will you be thoughtless.</p>

<p>Why then (you say) does He give [them] to many? Whence is it clear, that He gives [them]? But who else, you say, gives? Their overreaching, their plundering. How then does He allow these things? As He also [allows] murders, thefts, and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>.</p>

<p>What then (you will say) as to those who receive by succession an inheritance from their fathers, being themselves full of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> innumerable? And what of this? How does God suffer them (you say) to enjoy these things? Surely just as He allows thieves, and murderers, and other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doers. For it is not now the time of judgment, but of the best course of life.</p>

<p>And what I just now said, that I repeat, that they shall suffer greater punishment, who, when they have enjoyed all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, do not even so become better. For all shall not be punished alike; but they who, even after His benefits, have continued <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, shall suffer a greater punishment, while they who after poverty [have done this] not so. And that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, hear what He says to David, <q>Did I not give you all your master's goods?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#verse8">2 Samuel 12:8</a></span> Whenever then you see a young man that has received a paternal inheritance without labor and continues <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, be assured that his punishment is increased and the vengeance is made more intense. &nbsp;Let us not then emulate these; but if any man has succeeded to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, if any man has obtained spiritual <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, [him let us emulate]. For (it is said) <q>Woe to them that trust in their riches</q> <span class="stiki">cf.<a href="../bible/psa048.htm#verse6">Psalm 49:6</a></span>: <q>Blessed are they that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa127.htm#verse1">Psalm 128:1</a></span> To which of these, tell me, would you belong? Doubtless to those who are pronounced blessed. Therefore emulate these, not the other, that you also may obtain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are laid up for them. Which may we all obtain, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, with whom to the Father be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, now and for ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
