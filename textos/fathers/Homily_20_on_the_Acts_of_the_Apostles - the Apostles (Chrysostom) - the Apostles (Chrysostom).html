<h1>Homily 20 on the Acts of the Apostles</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Acts IX. 10, 12</p>

<p><q>And there was a certain <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord. And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, and has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.</q></p>

<p>What may be the reason that He neither drew any one of high authority and importance, nor caused such to be forthcoming for the purpose of instructing <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?  It was, because it was not meet that he should be induced by men, but only by Christ Himself: as in fact this man taught him nothing, but merely <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> him; for, as soon as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03C2;</span>), he was to draw upon himself the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, by his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and exceeding earnestness. And that Ananias was no very distinguished person, is plain. For, <q>the Lord,</q> it says, <q>spoke unto him in a vision, and Ananias answered and said, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he has done to Your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> at Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse13">Acts 9:13</a></span> For if he spoke in objection to Him, much more would he have done so, had He sent an Angel. And this is why, in the former instance, neither is Philip told what the matter is; but he sees the Angel, and then the Spirit bids him go near to the chariot. But observe here how the Lord relieves him of his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: <q>He is blind,</q> says He, <q>and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, and are you afraid?</q> In the same way <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also is afraid: so that the words betokened that he was afraid, and shrunk from the task, not that he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. He said, have heard from many concerning this man. What do you say? God speaks, and you hesitate. They did not yet well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <q>And here he has authority from the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to bind all that call on Your name.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse14">Acts 9:14</a></span> How was that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? It is likely that they, being in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, made minute enquiries. He does not say this, as thinking that Christ does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the fact, but, <q>such being the case, how,</q> says he, <q>can these things be?</q> As in fact those (in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>) say, <q>Who can be saved?</q>&mdash; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse26">Mark 10:26</a></span> This is done, in order that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him that shall come to him: <q>he has seen in a vision:</q> it has showed him beforehand: <q>he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>,</q> says (the Lord): <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not. And observe, He speaks not to him of the success achieved: teaching us not to speak of our achievements. And,  though He saw him afraid, for all this He said it not. <q>You shall not be disbelieved:</q> <q>he has seen,</q> says He, <q>in a vision a man (named) Ananias:</q> for this is why it was <q>in a vision,</q> namely, because he was blind. And not even the exceeding wonderfulness of the thing took possession of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple's</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so greatly was he afraid. But observe: <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> being blind, in this way He restored to sight. <q>But the Lord said unto him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name before the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and kings, and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>: for I will show him how great things he must suffer for My name's sake.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 15, 16.) <q>Not only,</q> says He, shall he be a believer, but even a teacher, and great boldness shall he show: 'before <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and kings'&mdash; such shall be the spread of the doctrine!&mdash; that just as He astonished (him) by the former, so He may (startle him even more) by the latter.  <q>And Ananias went, and entered into the house, and laid his hands upon him, and said, Brother Saul</q>&mdash; he straightway addresses him as a friend by that name&mdash; <q>Jesus, Who appeared unto you in the way in which you came</q>&mdash; and yet <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> had not told him this, but he learned it from the Spirit&mdash; <q>has sent me unto you, that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse17">Acts 9:17</a></span> As he said this, he laid his hands upon him. <q>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse18">Acts 9:18</a></span> Some say this was a sign of his blindness. Why did he not blind his eyes (entirely)? This was more wonderful, that, with his eyes open, he did not see: <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse8">Acts 9:8</a></span> which was just his case in respect of the Law, until  the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Name of Jesus</a> was put on him. <q>And he received sight immediately, and arose, and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. And having taken food, he recovered strength.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse19">Acts 9:19</a></span> He was faint, therefore, both from his journey and from his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; both from hunger, and from dejection of mind. Wishing therefore to deepen his dejection, He made the man blind until the coming of Ananias: and, that he might not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the blindness to be (only) fancy, this is the reason of the scales. He needed no other teaching: that which had befallen was made teaching (to him). <q>And he was with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> which were at Damascus certain days. And straightway in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> he preached Jesus,  that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse20">Acts 9:20</a></span> See, straightway he was a teacher in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>. He was not ashamed of the change, was not afraid while the very things in which he was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> afore-time, the same he destroyed. Even  from his first appearance on the stage here was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, death-dealing, ready for <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of blood: do you see what a manifest sign (was here)? And with this very thing, he put all in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>: for, said they, Hither also is he come for this very thing. <q>But all that heard him were amazed, and said: Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>? But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 21, 22.) As one learned in the Law, he stopped their mouths, and suffered them not to speak. They thought they were rid of disputation in such matters, in getting rid of Stephen, and they found another, more vehement than Stephen. </p>

<p>(Recapitulation.) But let us look at what relates to Ananias.  The Lord said not to him, Converse with him, and catechize him. For if, when He said, <q>He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, and has seen a man laying his hands upon him,</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 11, 12.) He did not persuade him, much less had He said this. So that he shall not disbelieve you, <q>he has seen in a vision.</q> Observe how in the former instance neither is Philip told all immediately. Fear not, He says: for this man is a chosen vessel for Me. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts 9:15</a></span> He more than sufficiently released him of his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, if the case be so that this man shall be so <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in our <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, as even to suffer many things. And <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> he is called <q>a vessel</q> (or, instrument)&mdash; for reason shows that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is not a physical quality: <q>a vessel of election</q> (or, chosen instrument), He says; for we choose that which is approved. And let not any <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, that (Ananias) speaks in unbelief of what was told him, as imagining that Christ was deceived: far from it! But affrighted and trembling, he did not even attend to what was said, at hearing the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Moreover, the Lord does not tell that He has blinded him: at the mention of his name <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> had prepossessed his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: <q>see,</q> he says, <q>to whom You are betraying me: 'and hither for this very purpose is he come, to bind all that call upon Your Name.' I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest he take me to Jerusalem: why dost Thou cast me into the mouth of the lion?</q> He is terrified, even while he speaks these words; that from every quarter we may learn the energetic character (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x1F75;&#x03BD;</span>) of the man. For that these things should be spoken by <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, were nothing wonderful: but that these (the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>) are so terrified, it is a most mighty <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Both the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is shown, and the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> greater after the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For there was indeed need of strength. Since He says, <q>a vessel of election,</q> that you may not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that God is to do all, He adds, to bear My Name before <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and kings, and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Ananias has heard what he most desired&mdash; that against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also he will take his stand: this above all gave him <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. <q>For I,</q> says He, <q>will show him how great things he must suffer for My Name's sake.</q> At the same time also this is said by way of putting Ananias to the blush: If he, that was so frantic, shall suffer all things, and thou not willing even to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> him! <q>It is well,</q> says he: <q>let him continue blind</q> (this  is why he says these words): <q>he is blind: why dost Thou at all bid me open his eyes, that he may bind (men) again?</q> Fear not the future: for that opening of his eyes he will use not against you, but for you (with reference to that saying, <q>That he may receive his sight</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse12">Acts 9:12</a></span>, these words are spoken): for not only will he do you no harm, but he <q>will suffer many things.</q> And what is wonderful indeed is,  that he shall first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <q>how great things he shall suffer,</q> and then shall take the field against the perils.&mdash; <q>Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus</q>&mdash; he says not, <q>Who made you blind,</q> but, <q>Who appeared with you in the way, has sent me unto you that you may receive your sight</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse17">Acts 9:17</a></span>: observe this man also, how he utters nothing boastful, but just as Peter said in the case of the lame man, <q>Why look ye on us, as though by our own power or <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> we had made him to walk,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse12">Acts 3:12</a></span> so here also he says, <q>Jesus, Who appeared unto you.</q> <em>(b)</em> Or,  (he says it) that the other may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: and he says not, He that was crucified, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, He that does wonders: but what? <q>He that appeared unto you:</q> (speaking) from what the other <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>: as Christ also added no more, neither said, I am Jesus, the Crucified, the Risen: but what? <q>Whom you persecute.</q> Ananias said not, <q>The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>,</q> that he may not seem as it were to rave over him (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B8;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&amp; 139<!--k29--&#183;&#x03BD;</span>), to deride him, <q>Who appeared unto you in the way:</q> and yet He did not (visibly) appear, but was seen by the things done. And immediately he added, wishing to draw a veil over the accusation: <q>That you may receive your sight.</q> I came not to reprove the past, but to bestow the gift: <q>that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <em>(a)</em> With hands laid on, he spoke these words. <q>And immediately there fell from his eyes,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse18">Acts 9:18</a></span>: a double blindness is removed.&mdash; And why says it, <q>Having taken food, he was strengthened?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse19">Acts 9:19</a></span> Because they that are in such case become relaxed: he had no heart to partake of food before, until he obtained the mighty gifts. <em>(c)</em> It seems to me, that both <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Cornelius, at the very instant when the words were spoken, received the Spirit. And yet (in this case) the giver was no great one. So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is it, that there was naught of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> in the things done, nor anything was done by man, but God was present, the Doer of these things. And at the same time (the Lord) both teaches him to think modestly of himself, in that He does not bring him to the Apostles who were so admired, and shows that there is nothing of man here. He was not filled, however, with the Spirit which works signs: that in this way also his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might be shown; for he wrought no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. <q>And straightway,</q> it says, <q>in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> he preached Jesus</q>&mdash; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse20">Acts 9:20</a></span> not that He is risen&mdash; not this: no, nor that He lives: but what? Immediately he strictly expounded the doctrine&mdash; <q>that this is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And all that heard him were amazed,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse21">Acts 9:21</a></span> They were reduced to utter incredulity. And yet they ought not to have wondered only, but to worship and reverence. <q>Is not this he,</q> etc. He had not merely been a persecutor, but <q>destroyed them which called on this Name</q>&mdash; they did not say, <q>on Jesus;</q> for <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, they could not bear even to hear His name&mdash; and what is more marvellous still, <q>and came hither for this purpose,</q> etc. <q>We cannot say, that he associated with the Apostles before.</q> See by how many (witnesses) he is confessed to have been of the number of the enemies! But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> not only was not confounded by these things, nor hid his face for shame, but <q>increased the more in strength, and confounded the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse22">Acts 9:22</a></span>, i.e. put them to silence, left them nothing to say for themselves, <q>proving, that this is very Christ.</q> <q>Teaching,</q> it says: for this man was a teacher.</p>

<p><q>And after that many days were fulfilled, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> took counsel to kill him.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse23">Acts 9:23</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> again resort to that valid argument (<span class="greek">&#x1F30;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C7;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>) of theirs, not now seeking false-accusers and false-witnesses; they cannot wait for these now: but what do they? They set about it by themselves. For as they see the affair on the increase, they do not even use the form of a trial. <q>But their laying await was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse24">Acts 9:24</a></span> For this was more intolerable to them than the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which had taken place&mdash; than the five thousand, the three thousand, than everything, in short. And observe him, how he is delivered, not by (miraculous) <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but by man's wisdom&mdash; not as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were&mdash; <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x1F34;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;</span>, <a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse19">Acts 5:19</a></span> that you may learn the energetic (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD;</span>) character of the man, how he shines even without <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. <q>Then the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> took him by night,</q> that the affair might not be suspected, <q>and let him down by the wall in a basket.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse25">Acts 9:25</a></span> What then? Having escaped such a danger, does he flee? By no means, but goes where he kindled them to greater rage.</p>

<p>(Recapitulation, <!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 20, 21.) <q>And straightway in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> he preached Jesus</q>&mdash; for he was accurate in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; <q>that this is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. But all that heard him were amazed,</q> etc., for indeed it was incredible. <q>But Saul increased,</q> etc. Therefore <q>after many days</q> this happens: viz. the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <q>took counsel to kill him. And their laying await was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Saul.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm">Acts 22:22-24</a></span> What does this mean? It is likely that for awhile he did not choose to depart thence, though many, perhaps, besought him; but when he learned it, then he permitted his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: for he had <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> immediately.</p>

<p><q>Then the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse25">Acts 9:25</a></span> Of this occurrence he says: <q>The ethnarch of Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to apprehend me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse32">2 Corinthians 11:32</a></span> But observe the Writer here,  that he does not tell the story ambitiously, and so as to show what an important person <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was, saying, <q>For they stirred up the king,</q> and so forth: but only, <q>Then the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> took him by night, and let him down by the wall&mdash; in a basket:</q> for they sent him out alone, and none with him. And it was well they did this: the consequence being, that he showed himself to the Apostles in Jerusalem. Now they sent him out, as bound to provide for his safety by flight: but he did just the contrary&mdash; he leaped into the midst of those who were mad against him. This it is to be on fire, this to be fervent indeed! From that day forth he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all the commands which the Apostles had heard: <q>Except a man take up his cross, and follow Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse38">Matthew 10:38</a></span> The very fact that he had been slower to come than the rest made him more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>: for <q>to whom much is forgiven</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke 7:47</a></span> the same will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more, so that the later he came, the more he loved: * * *  and having done ten thousand wrongs, he thought he could never do enough to cast the former <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> into the shade. <q>Proving</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse22">Acts 9:22</a></span>, it says: i.e. with mildness teaching. And observe, they did not say to him, You are he that destroyed: why are you changed? For they were ashamed: but they said it to themselves. For he would have said to them, This very thing ought to teach you, as in fact he does thus plead in his speech before Agrippa. Let us imitate this, man: let us bear our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in our hands ready to confront all dangers.&mdash; (That he fled from Damascus) this was no cowardice:  he preserved himself for the preaching. Had he been a coward, he would not have gone to Jerusalem, would not immediately have commenced teaching: he would have abated somewhat of his vehemence: for he had been taught by the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of Stephen. He was no coward, but he was also <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> (<span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>) (in husbanding himself). Wherefore he thought it no great thing to die for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel's</a> sake, unless he should do this to great advantage: willing not even to see Christ, Whom most of all he longed to see, while the work of his stewardship among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> was not yet complete. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians 1:23-24</a></span>. Such ought to be the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. From  his first appearance from the very outset, the character of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declared itself: nay even before this, even in the things which he did <q>not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse2">Romans 10:2</a></span>, it was not by man's reasoning that he was moved to act as he did.  For if, so long afterwards, he was content not to depart, much more at the beginning of his trading voyage, when he had but just left the harbor! Many things Christ leaves to be done by (ordinary) <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom, that we may learn that (his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>) were men, that it was not all everywhere to be done by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: for otherwise they would have been mere motionless logs: but in many things they managed matters themselves.&mdash; This is not less than <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>&mdash;to shrink from no suffering for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the many. Nothing so delights God. Again will I repeat what I have often said: and I repeat it, because I do exceedingly desire it: as Christ also did the same, when discoursing concerning forgiveness: <q>When ye <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, forgive if you have anything against any man:</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar011.htm#verse25">Mark 11:25</a></span> and again to Peter He said, <q>I say not unto you, Forgive until seven times, but until seventy-times seven.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse22">Matthew 18:22</a></span> And Himself in fact forgives the transgressions against Him. So do we also, because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is the very goal of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, continually discourse thereof. Nothing is more frigid than a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, who cares not for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others. You can not here plead poverty: for she that cast down the two mites, shall be your accuser. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse1">Luke 21:1</a></span> And Peter said, <q>Silver and gold have I none.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse6">Acts 3:6</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was so poor, that he was often hungered, and wanted necessary food. You can not plead lowness of birth: for they too were ignoble men, and of ignoble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. You can not allege want of education: for they too were <q>unlearned men.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse13">Acts 4:13</a></span> Even if you be a slave therefore and a runaway slave, you can perform your part: for such was Onesimus: yet see to what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> calls him, and to how great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> he advances him: <q>that he may communicate with me,</q> he says, <q>in my bonds.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phm001.htm#verse13">Philemon 13</a></span> You can not plead infirmity: for such was Timothy, having often infirmities; for, says the apostle, <q>Use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and your frequent infirmities.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1 Timothy 5:23</a></span> Every one can profit his neighbor, if he will fulfil his part. See ye not the unfruitful trees, how strong they are, how fair, how large also, and smooth, and of great height? But if we had a garden; we should much rather have pomegranates, or fruitful olive trees: for the others are for delight to the eye, not for profit, which in them is but small. Such are those men who only consider their own interest: nay, not such even since these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are fit only for burning: whereas those trees are useful both for building and for the safety of those within. Such too were those Virgins, chaste indeed, and decent, and modest, but profitable to none <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse1">Matthew 25:1</a></span> wherefore they are burned. Such are they who have not nourished Christ. For observe that none of those are charged with particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their own, with fornication, for instance, or with <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>; in short, with no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but the having been of no use to another. Such was he who buried his talent, showing indeed a blameless life, but not being useful to another. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse25">Matthew 25:25</a></span> How can such an one be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? Say, if the leaven being mixed up with the flour did not change the whole into its own nature, would such a thing be leaven? Again, if a perfume shed no sweet odor on those who approach it, could we call it a perfume? Say not, <q>It is impossible for me to induce others (to become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>)</q>&mdash; for if you are a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, it is impossible but that it should be so. For as the natural properties of things cannot be gainsaid, so it is here: the thing is part of the very nature of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. Do not insult God. To say, that the sun cannot shine, would be to insult Him: to say that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cannot do good, is to insult <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and call Him a liar. For it is easier for the sun not to give heat, nor to shine, than for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> not to send forth light: it is easier for the light to be darkness, than for this to be so. Tell me not that it is impossible: the contrary is the impossible. Do not insult God. If we once get our own affairs in a right state, the other will certainly follow as a natural and necessary consequence. It is not possible for the light of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to be hid; not possible for a lamp so conspicuous as that to be concealed. Let us not be careless. For, as the profit from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> reaches both to ourselves, and to those who are benefited by it: so from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> there is a two-fold loss, reaching both to ourselves, and to those who are injured by it. Let there be (if you will) some private man, who has suffered numberless ills from some one, and let no one take his part, yet let that man still return good offices; what teaching so mighty as this? What words, or what exhortations could equal it? What <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> were it not enough to extinguish and soften? <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> therefore these things, let us hold fast to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is not possible to be saved otherwise, than by passing through this present life in doing these good works, that we may also obtain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are to come, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with Whom to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, might, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
