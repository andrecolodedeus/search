<h1>Homily 21 on the Acts of the Apostles</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Acts IX. 26, 27</p>

<p><q>And when Saul had come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: but they were all afraid of him, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not that he was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the Apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way.</q></p>

<p>One may well be much at a loss here to understand how it is that, whereas in the Epistle to the Galatians <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>I went not to Jerusalem,</q> but <q>into Arabia</q> and <q>to Damascus,</q> and, <q>After three years I went up to Jerusalem,</q> and <q>to see Peter</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse17"Galatians 1:17</a></span>, (<span class="greek">&#x1F31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x1F25;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span> Cat.) here the writer says the contrary. (There, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says,) <q>And none of the Apostles saw I; but here, it is said (Barnabas), brought him to the Apostles.</q>&mdash; Well, then, either (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) means, I went not up with intent to refer or attach myself to them (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B8;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>)&mdash; for what says he? <q>I referred not myself, neither went I to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me:</q>  or else, that the laying await for him in Damascus was after his return from Arabia;  or else, again, that the visit to Jerusalem was after he came from Arabia. Certainly of his own accord he went not to the Apostles, but <q>assayed to join himself unto the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a></q>&mdash; as being  a teacher, not a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>&mdash; <q>I went not,</q> he says, <q>for this purpose, that I should go to those who were Apostles before me: certainly, I learned nothing from them.</q> Or,  he does not speak of this visit, but passes it by, so that the order is, <q>I went into Arabia, then I came to Damascus, then to Jerusalem, then to <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>:</q> or else, again, that he went up to Jerusalem, then was sent to Damascus, then to Arabia, then again to Damascus, then to C&aelig;sarea. Also, the visit <q>after fourteen years,</q> probably, was when he brought up the [<a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to the] brethren together with Barnabas: <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse1"Galatians 2:1</a></span> or else he means a different occasion. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse30">Acts 11:30</a></span>  For the Historian for conciseness, often omits incidents, and condenses the times. Observe how unambitious the writer is, and how he does not even relate <span class="stiki">related in <a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse17">Acts 22:17-21</a></span> that vision, but passes it by. <q>He assayed,</q> it says, <q>to join himself to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And they were afraid of him.</q> By this again is shown the ardor of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> character: not (only) from the mouth of Ananias, and of those who wondered at him there, but also of those in Jerusalem: <q>they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not that he was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>:</q> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> that was beyond all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> expectation.  He  was no longer a wild beast, but a man mild and gentle! And observe how he does not go to the Apostles, such is his forbearance, but to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as being a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. He was not thought worthy of credit. <q>But Barnabas</q>&mdash; <q>Son of Consolation</q> is his appellation, whence also he makes himself easy of access to the man: for <q>he was a kind man</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse24">Acts 11:24</a></span>, exceedingly, and this is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> both by the present instance, and in the affair of John (Mark)&mdash; <q>having taken him, brought him to the Apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse39">Acts 15:39</a></span> It is likely that at Damascus also he had heard all about him: whence <em>he</em> was not afraid but the others were, for he was a man whose glance inspired <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. <q>How,</q> it says, <q>he had seen the Lord in the way, and that He had spoken unto him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of the Lord. And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of Jesus</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse28">Acts 9:28</a></span>: these things were demonstrative of the former, and by his acts he made good what was spoken of him. <q>And he spoke, and disputed with the Hellenists.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse29">Acts 9:29</a></span> So then the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were afraid of him, and the Apostles did not trust him; by this therefore he relieves them of their <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. <q>With the Hellenists:</q> he means those who used the Greek tongue: and this he did, very wisely; for those others, those profound Hebrews had no mind even to see him. <q>But they,</q> it says, <q>went about to slay him:</q> a token, this, of his energy, and triumphant victory, and of their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Thereupon, fearing lest the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to C&aelig;sarea. For it says, <q>When the brethren were aware of this, they brought him down to C&aelig;sarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse30">Acts 9:30</a></span>, at the same time to preach, and likely to be more in safety, as being in his own country. But observe, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, how far it is from being the case that everything is done by (miraculous) <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; how, on the contrary, God does in many things leave them to manage for themselves by their own wisdom and in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> way; so  to cut off the excuse of idle people: for if it was so in the case of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, much more in theirs.  Then, it says, <q>the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> had peace (they), being edified, and walking in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, and abounded in the comfort of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse31">Acts 9:31</a></span> He is about to relate that Peter goes down (from Jerusalem), therefore that you may not impute this to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he first says this. For while there was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he was in Jerusalem, but when the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are everywhere in security, then it is that he leaves Jerusalem. See how fervent and energetic he is! For he did not think, because there was peace, therefore there was no need of his presence. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>  departed, and there was peace: there is no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> nor disturbance. Them, they respected most, as having often stood by them, and as being held in admiration by the multitude: but him, they despised, and were more savage against him. See, how great a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and immediately, peace! See what that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> effected. It dispersed the peace-makers. In <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, Simon was put to shame: in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, the affair of Sapphira took place. Not that, because there was peace, therefore matters became relaxed, but such was the peace as also to need exhortation. <q>And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which dwelt at Lydda.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse32">Acts 9:32</a></span> Like the commander of an army, he went about, inspecting the ranks, what part was compact, what in good order, what needed his presence. See how on all occasions he goes about, foremost. When an Apostle was to be chosen, he was the foremost: when the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were to be told, that these were <q>not drunken,</q> when the lame man was to be healed, when harangues to be made, he is before the rest: when the rulers were to be spoken to, he was the man; when Ananias, he <span class="stiki">ch. 1:15; 2:15; 3:4-12; 4:8; 5:3-15</span>: when healings were wrought by the shadow, still it was he. And look: where there was danger, he was the man, and where good  management (was needed); but where all is calm, there they act all in common, and he demands no greater <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> (than the others). When need was to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, he starts forward, and here again he is the man to labor and toil. <q>And there he found a certain man named &AElig;neas, which had kept his bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy. And Peter said unto him, &AElig;neas, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> makes you whole: arise, and make your bed. And he arose immediately.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 33, 34.) And why did he not wait for the man's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and ask if he wished to be healed? In the first place, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> served for exhortation to many: hear then how great the gain. <q>And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse35">Acts 9:35</a></span> For the man was notable. <q>Arise, and make your bed:</q> he does well to give a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>: for they not only released men of their diseases, but in giving the health they gave the strength also. Moreover, at that time they had given no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of their power, so that the man could not reasonably have been required to show his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as neither in the case of the lame man did they demand it. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse6">Acts 3:6</a></span> As therefore Christ in the beginning of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> did not demand <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so neither did these. For in Jerusalem indeed, as was but reasonable, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the parties was first shown; <q>they brought out their sick into the streets, but as Peter passed by, his shadow at least might fall upon some of them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse15">Acts 5:15</a></span>; for many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> had been wrought there; but here this is the first that occurs. For of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, some were wrought for the purpose of drawing others (to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>); some for the comfort of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. <q>Now there was at Joppa a certain <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was full of good works and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> which she did. And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber. And forasmuch as Lydda was near to Joppa, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him that he would not delay to come to them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse36">Acts 9:36-38</a></span>. Why did they wait till she was dead? Why was not Peter solicited (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F7B;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;</span>) before this? So right-minded (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x1F55;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span>) were they, they did not think it proper to trouble (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x1F7B;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>) the Disciples about such matters, and to take them away from the preaching: as indeed this is why it mentions that the place was near, seeing  they asked this as a thing beside his mark, and not now in the regular course. <q>Not to delay to come unto them:</q> for she was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. And Peter arose, and went with them. And when he had come, they led him into the upper chamber. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse39">Acts 9:39</a></span> They do not beseech, but leave it to him to give her life (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C9;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>.) See  what a cheering inducement to <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> is here! <q>And all the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>,</q> it says, <q>stood round him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.</q> Peter went into the apartment, as one who took it calmly, but see what an accession came of it! It is not without a meaning that the Writer has informed us of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> name, but to show that the name she bore (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F7D;&#x03BD;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x1F26;&#x03BD;</span>) matched her character; as active and wakeful was she as an antelope. For in many instances there is a Providence in the giving of names, as we have often told you. <q>She was full,</q> it says, <q>of good works:</q> not only of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, but <q>of good works,</q> first, and then of this good work in particular. <q>Which,</q> it says, <q>Dorcas made while she was with them.</q> Great humility! Not as we do; but they were all together in common, and in company with them she made these things and worked. <q>But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse40">Acts 9:40</a></span> Why does he put them all out? That he may not be confused nor disturbed by their weeping. <q>And having knelt down, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>.</q> Observe the intentness of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <q>And  he gave her his hand.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse41">Acts 9:41</a></span> So did Christ to the daughter of Jairus: <q>And (says the Evangelist) having taken her by the hand.</q> Mark severally, first the life, then the strength brought into her, the one by the word, the other by his hand&mdash; <q>And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, presented her alive:</q> to some for comfort, because they received back their sister, and because they saw the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and for kindly support (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>) to others. <q>And it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> throughout all Joppa; and many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the Lord. And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse42">Acts 9:42-43</a></span> Mark the unassuming conduct, mark the moderation of Peter, how he does not make his abode with this lady, or some other person of distinction, but with a tanner: by all his acts leading men to humility, neither suffering the mean to be ashamed, nor the great to be elated! <q>Many days;</q>  for they needed his instruction, who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> through the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.&mdash; Let us look then again at what has been said.</p>

<p><q>Assayed,</q> it says, <q>to join himself to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q> <span class="stiki">Recapitulation, <a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse26">Acts 9:26</a></span> He did not come up to them unabashed, but with a subdued manner. <q>Disciples</q>  they were all called at that time by reason of their great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for there was the likeness of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> plainly to be seen. <q>But they were all afraid of him.</q> See how they feared the dangers, how the alarm was yet at its height in them. <q>But Barnabas,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse27">Acts 9:27</a></span>&mdash; it seems to me that Barnabas was of old a friend of his&mdash; <q>and related,</q> etc.: observe how <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says nothing of all this himself: nor would he have brought it forward to the others, had he not been compelled to do so. <q>And he was with them, coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 28, 29.) This gave them all confidence. <q>But they went about to slay him: which when the brethren <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a></q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse30">Acts 9:30</a></span> Do you observe how both there (at Damascus), and here, the rest take care for him, and provide for him the means of departure, and that we nowhere find him thus far receiving (direct supernatural) aid from God? So the energy of his character is betokened. <q>To C&aelig;sarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus:</q> so that, I suppose, he did not continue his journey by land, but sailed the rest of it. And this (departure) is Providentially ordered, that he might preach there also: and so likewise were the plots against him ordered by God's Providence, and his coming to Jerusalem, that the story about him might no longer be disbelieved. For there he was <q>speaking boldly,</q> it says, <q>in the name of the Lord Jesus; and he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists;</q> and again, <q>he was with them coming in and going out.&mdash; So  the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> and <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> had peace</q>&mdash; i.e. it increased: and peace with itself, that peace which is peace indeed: for the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> from without would have done them no harm &mdash; <q>they being edified, and walking in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, and abounded in the consolation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> And the spirit consoled them both by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and by the works, and independently of these in the person of each individual. <q>And it came to pass, etc. And Peter said unto him, Eneas,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse32">Acts 9:32-34</a></span>  But before discourse, before exhortations, he says to the lame man himself, <q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> makes you whole.</q> This word he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in any wise, and was made whole. Observe how unassuming he is: for he said not, <q>In the Name,</q> but  rather as a sign he narrates the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> itself, and speaks as its Evangelist. <q>And having seen him,</q> it says, <q>all that dwelt in Lydda, and Saron, turned unto the Lord.&mdash; Now there was at Joppa,</q> etc. (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 35, 36.) Observe everywhere the signs taking place. But let us so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, as if we were now beholding them. It is not simply said, that Tabitha died, but that she died, having been in a state of weakness. And (yet) they did not call Peter until she died; then <q>they sent and told him not to delay to come unto them.</q> Observe, they send and call him by others. And he comes: he did not think it a piece of disrespect, to be summoned by two men: for, it says, <q>they sent two men unto him.</q>&mdash; Affliction, my beloved, is a great thing, and rivets our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> together. Not a word of wailing there, nor of mourning. See  how thoroughly matters are cleansed! <q>Having washed her,</q> it says, <q>they laid her in an upper chamber:</q> that is, they did all (that was right) for the dead body. Then Peter having come, <q>knelt down, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>; and turning him to the body, said, Tabitha, arise.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse40">Acts 9:40</a></span> They did not perform all their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> with the same ease. But this was profitable for them: for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God took thought not only for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others, but for their own. He that healed so many by his very shadow, how is it that he now has to do so much first? There are cases also in which the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the applicants co&ouml;perated. This is the first dead person that he raises. Observe how he, as it were, awakes her out of sleep: first she opened her eyes: then upon seeing (Peter) she sat up: then from his hand she received strength. <q>And it was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> throughout all Joppa, and many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse42">Acts 9:42</a></span> Mark the gain, mark the fruit, that it was not for display. Indeed, this is why he puts them all out, imitating his Master in this also.</p>

<p>  For where tears are&mdash; or rather, where <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are, there tears ought not to be; not where such a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is celebrating. Hear, I beseech you: although somewhat of the like kind does not take place now, yet in the case of our dead likewise, a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is celebrating. Say,  if as we sit together, the Emperor were to send and invite some one of us to the palace, would it be right, I ask, to weep and mourn? Angels are present, commissioned from heaven and come from thence, sent from the King Himself to call their fellow servant, and say, do you weep? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> what a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> it is that is taking place, how awful, how dread, and worthy indeed of <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and lauds? Would you learn, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that this is no time for tears? For it is a very great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As if leaving her dwelling, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> goes forth, speeding on her way to her own Lord, and do you mourn? Why then, you should do this on the birth of a child: for this in fact is also a birth, and a better than that. For here she goes forth to a very different light, is loosed as from a prison-house, comes off as from a contest. <q>Yes,</q> say you, <q>it is all very well to say this,  in the case of those of whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> we are assured.</q> Then, what ails you, O man, that even in the case of such, thou dost not take it in this way? Say, what can you have to condemn in the little child? Why do you mourn for it? What in the newly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? For he too is brought into the same condition: why do you mourn for him? For as the sun arises clear and bright, so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, leaving the body with a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, shines joyously. Not such the spectacle of Emperor as he comes in state to take possession of the city (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1; &#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>), not such the hush of awe, as when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> having quitted the body is departing in company with Angels. Think what the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> must then be! In what amazement, what wonder, what delight! Why do you mourn? Answer me.&mdash; But it is only in the case of sinners you do this? Would that it were so, and I would not forbid your mournings, would that this were the object! This lamentation were Apostolic, this were after the pattern of the Lord; for even Jesus wept over Jerusalem. I would that your mournings were discriminated by this rule. But when you speak the words of one  that would call back (the dead), and speakest of your long intimacy and his beneficence, it is but for this you mourn (not because he was a sinner), thou dost but pretend to say it. Mourn, bewail the sinner, and I too will give a loose to tears; I, more than thou, the greater the punishment to which he is liable as such: I too will lament, with such an object. But not thou alone must lament him that is such; the whole city must do the same, and all that meet you on the way, as men bewail them that are led to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. For this is a death indeed, an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> death, the death of sinners. But (with you) all is clean reversed. Such lamentation marks a lofty <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and conveys much instruction; the other marks a littleness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If we all lamented with this sort of lamentation, we should amend the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> themselves while yet living. For as, if it rested with you to apply medicines which would prevent that bodily death, you would use them, just so now, if <em>this</em> death were the death you lament, you would prevent its taking place, both in yourself and in him. Whereas now our behavior is a perfect riddle; that having it in our power to hinder its coming, we let it take place, and mourn over it when it has come. Worthy indeed of lamentations are they (when we consider), what time as they shall stand before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, what words they shall then hear, what they shall suffer! To no purpose have these men lived: nay, not to no purpose, but to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purpose! Of them too it may be fitly said, <q>It were good for them had they never been born.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse21">Mark 14:21</a></span> For what profit is it, I ask, to have spent so much time to the hurt of his own person? Had it been spent only to no purpose, were not that, I ask you, punishment enough! If one who has been an hired servant twenty years were to find that he has had all his labor in vain, would he not weep and lament, and think himself the most miserable of men? Why, here is a man who has lost all the labor of a whole life: not one day has he lived for himself, but to luxury, to debauchery, to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Then, say, shall we not bewail this man? Shall we not try to snatch him from his perils? For it is, yes, it is possible, if we will, to mitigate his punishment, if we make continual <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for him, if for him we give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. However unworthy he may be, God will yield to our importunity. For if  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> showed mercy on one (who had no claims on his mercy), and for the sake of others spared one (whom he would not have spared), much more is it right for us to do this. By means of his substance, by means of your own, by what means you will, aid him: pour in oil, nay rather, water. Has he no <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsdeeds</a> of his own to exhibit? Let him have at least those of his kindred. Has he none done by himself? At least let him have those which are done for him, that his wife may with confidence beg him off in that day, having paid down the ransom for him. The more <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> he has to answer for, the greater need has he of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, not only for this reason, but because the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> has not the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> now, but far less: for it is not all one to have done it himself, and to have another do it for him; therefore, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> being less, let us by quantity make it the greatest. Let us not busy ourselves about monuments, not about memorials. This is the greatest memorial: set <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> to stand around him. Tell them his name: bid them all make for him their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, their supplications: this will overcome God: though it have not been done by the man himself, yet because of him another is the author of the almsgiving. Even this pertains to the mercy of God: <q><a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> standing around and weeping</q> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to rescue, not indeed from the present death, but from that which is to come. Many have profited even by the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> done by others on their behalf: for even if they have not got perfect (deliverance), at least they have found some comfort thence. If it be not so, how are children saved? And yet there, the children themselves contribute nothing, but their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> do all: and often have <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> had their children given them, though the children themselves contributed nothing. Many are the ways God gives us to be saved, only let us not be negligent.</p>

<p>How then if one be poor? Say you. Again I say, the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> is not estimated by the quantity given, but by the purpose. Only give not less than your ability, and you have paid all. How then, say you, if he be desolate and a stranger, and have none to care for him? And why is it that he has none, I ask you? In this very thing you suffer your desert, that you have none to be thus your friend, thus <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. This is so ordered on purpose that, though we be not ourselves <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, we may study to have <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> companions and friends&mdash; both wife, and son, and friend&mdash; as reaping some good even through them, a slight gain indeed, but yet a gain. If you make it your chief object not to marry a rich wife,  but to have a devout wife, and a religious daughter, you shall gain this consolation; if you study to have your son not rich but devout, you shall also gain this consolation. If you make these your objects then wilt yourself be such as they. This also is part of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to choose such friends, and such a wife and children. Not in vain are the oblations made for the departed, not in vain the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, not in vain the almsdeeds: all those things has the Spirit ordered,  wishing us to be benefited one by the other. See: he is benefited, you are benefited: because of him, you have despised <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, being set on to do some generous act: both you are the means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to him, and he to you the occasion of your almsgiving. Doubt not that he shall get some good thereby. It is not for nothing that the Deacon cries, <q>For them that are fallen asleep in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and for them that make the memorials for them.</q> It is not the Deacon that utters this voice, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: I speak of the Gift. What do you say? There is the Sacrifice in hand, and all things laid out duly ordered: Angels are there present, Archangels, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is there: all stand with such awe, and in the general silence those stand by, crying aloud: and do you think that what is done, is done in vain? Then is not the rest also all in vain, both the oblations made for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and those for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and for the whole body? God forbid! But all is done with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. What do you think of the oblation made for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, of the calling made in that hour, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> though they be, yet even <q>for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>?</q>  It is a great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to be named in the presence of the Lord, when that memorial is celebrating, the dread Sacrifice, the unutterable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. For just as, so long as the Emperor is seated, is the time for the petitioner to effect what he wishes to effect, but when he is risen, say what he will, it is all in vain, so at that time, while the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> is going on, it is for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the greatest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to be held worthy of mention. For look: then is declared the dread <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, that God gave Himself for the world: along with that <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> he seasonably puts Him in mind of them that have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. For as when the celebration of Emperor.' victories is in progress, then, as many as had their part in the victory receive their meed of praise, while at the same time as many as are in bonds are set at liberty in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the occasion; but when the occasion is past, he that did not obtain this favor then, no longer gets any: so is it here likewise: this is the time of celebration of a victory. For, says it, <q>so often as you eat this bread, you do show forth the Lord's death.</q> Then let us not approach indifferently, nor <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that these things are done in any ordinary sort. But it is in another sense  that we make mention of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and this, for assurance that the Lord is not dead: and this, for a sign that death has received its death's blow, that death itself is dead. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> these things, let us devise what consolations we can for the departed, instead of tears, instead of laments, instead of tombs, our <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, our oblations, that both they and we may attain unto the promised blessings, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and loving-kindness of His only-begotten Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with Whom to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> together be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, dominion, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
