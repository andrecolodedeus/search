<h1>Homily 21 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 1:49-50</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Nathanael answered and says unto Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God, You are the King of Israel. Jesus answered, and said unto him, Because I said unto you, I saw you under the fig-tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.</q></div>

<p>1. Beloved, we need much care, much watchfulness, to be able to look into the depth of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>. For it is not possible to discover their meaning in a careless way, or while we are asleep, but there needs close search, and there needs earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that we may be enabled to see some little way into the secrets of the divine oracles. Today, for instance, here is no trifling question proposed to us, but one which requires much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and enquiry. For when Nathanael said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> Christ replies, <q>Because I said unto you, I saw you under the fig-tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.</q></p>

<p>Now what is the question arising from this passage? It is this.  Peter, when after so many <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and such high doctrine he confessed that, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse16">Matthew 16:16</a></span>, is called <q>blessed,</q> as having received the revelation from the Father; while Nathanael, though he said the very same thing before seeing or hearing either <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> or doctrine, had no such word addressed to him, but as though he had not said so much as he ought to have said, is brought  to things greater still. What can be the reason of this? It is, that Peter and Nathanael both spoke the same words, but not both with the same intention. Peter confessed Him to be <q>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></q> but as being Very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; Nathanael, as being mere man. And whence does this appear? From what he said after these words; for after, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</q> he adds, <q>You are the King  of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> But the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not <q>King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a></q> only, but of all the world.</p>

<p>And what I say is clear, not from this only, but also from what follows. For Christ added nothing more to Peter, but as though his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were perfect, said, that upon this confession of his He would build the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but in the other case He did nothing like this, but the contrary. For as though some large, and that the better, part were wanting to his confession He added what follows. For what says He?</p>

<h2>John 1:51</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Verily, verily I say unto you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the Angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.</q></div>

<p>Do you see how He leads him up little by little from the earth, and causes him no longer to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> Him a man merely? For One to whom Angels minister, and on whom Angels ascend and descend, how could He be man? For this reason He said, <q>You shall see greater things than these.</q> And in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this, He introduces the ministry of Angels. And what He means is something of this kind: <q>Does this, O Nathanael, seem to you a great matter, and have you for this confessed me to be King of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? What then will you say, when you see the Angels ascending and descending upon Me?</q> Persuading him by these words to own Him Lord also of the Angels. For on Him as on the King's own Son, the royal ministers ascended and descended, once at the season of the Crucifixion, again at the time of the Resurrection and the Ascension, and before this also, when they <q>came and ministered unto Him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew 4:11</a></span>, when they proclaimed the glad tidings of His birth, and cried, <q>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke 2:14</a></span>, when they came to Mary, when they came to Joseph.</p>

<p>And He does now what He has done in many instances; He utters two predictions, gives present <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the one, and confirms that which has to be accomplished by that which is so already. For of His sayings some had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, such as, <q>Before Philip called you, under the fig-tree I saw you</q>; others had yet to come to pass, and had partly done so, namely, the descending and ascending of the Angels, at the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the Ascension; and this He renders credible by His words even before the event. For one who had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> His power by what had gone before, and heard from Him of things to come, would more readily receive this prediction too.</p>

<p>What then does Nathanael? To this he makes no reply. And therefore at this point Christ stopped His discourse with him, allowing him to consider in private what had been said; and not choosing to pour forth all at once, having cast seed into fertile ground, He then leaves it to shoot at leisure. And this He has shown in another place, where He says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is like to a man that sows good seed, but while he slept, his enemy comes, and sows tares among the wheat.</q> </p>

<h2>John 2:1-2</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>On the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee. And Jesus was called to the marriage. And the mother of Jesus was there, and His brethren.</q> </div>

<p>I said before that He was best <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; therefore they invite Him to the marriage, and He comes; for He looked not to His own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but to our benefit. He who disdained not to <q>take upon Him the form of a servant</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a></span>, would much less disdain to be present at the marriage of servants; He who sat down <q>with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse13">Matthew 9:13</a></span>, would much less refuse to sit down with those present at the marriage. Assuredly they who invited Him had not formed a proper judgment of Him, nor did they invite Him as some great one, but merely as an ordinary acquaintance; and this the Evangelist has hinted at, when he says, <q>The mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was there, and His brethren.</q> Just as they invited her and His brethren, they invited Jesus.</p>

<h2>John 2:3</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And when they wanted wine, His mother says unto Him, They have no wine.</q></div>

<p>Here it is worth while to enquire whence it came into His mother's mind to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> anything great of her Son; for He had as yet done no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, since the Evangelist says, <q>This beginning of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> did Jesus in <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse11">John 2:11</a></span></p>

<p>2. Now if any say that this is not a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that it was the <q>beginning of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>,</q> because there is added simply <q>in <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>,</q> as allowing it to have been the first done there, but not altogether and absolutely the first, for He probably might have done others elsewhere, we will make answer to him of that which we have said before. And of what kind? The words of John (the Baptist); <q>And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not; but that He should be made manifest to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, therefore am I come, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> with water.</q> Now if He had wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in early age, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> would not have needed another to declare Him. For He who came among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and by His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> was so made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, not to those only in Jud&aelig;a, but also to those in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and beyond, and who did this in three years only, or rather who did not need even these three years to manifest Himself <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse24">Matthew 4:24</a></span>, for immediately and from the first His fame went abroad everywhere; He, I say, who in a short time so shone forth by the multitude of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, that His name was  well known to all, was much less likely, if while a child He had from an early age wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, to escape notice so long. For what was done would have seemed stranger as done by a boy, and there would have been time for twice or thrice as many, and much more. But in fact He did nothing while He was a child, save only that one thing to which Luke has testified <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse46">Luke 2:46</a></span>, that at the age of twelve years He sat hearing the doctors, and was thought admirable for His questioning. Besides, it was in accordance with likelihood and reason that He did not begin His signs at once from an early age; for they would have deemed the thing a delusion. For if when He was of full age many suspected this, much more, if while quite young He had wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, would they have hurried Him sooner and before the proper time to the Cross, in the venom of their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; and the very facts of the Dispensation would have been discredited.</p>

<p><q>How then,</q> asks some one, <q>came it into the mind of His mother to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> anything great of Him?</q> He was now beginning to reveal Himself, and was plainly discovered by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of John, and by what He had said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And before all this, the Conception itself and all its attending circumstances  had inspired her with a very great opinion of the Child; <q>for,</q> said Luke, <q>she heard all the sayings concerning the Child, and kept them in her heart.</q>  <q>Why then,</q> says one, <q>did not she speak this before?</q>  Because, as I said, it was now at last that He was beginning to manifest Himself. Before this time He lived as one of the many, and therefore His mother had not confidence to say any such thing to Him; but when she heard that John had come on His account, and that he had borne such <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Him as he did, and that He had <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, after that she took confidence, and called Him, and said, when they wanted wine, <q>They have no wine.</q> For she desired both to do them a favor, and through her Son to render herself more conspicuous; perhaps too she had some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feelings, like His brethren, when they said, <q>Show yourself to the world</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse4">John 17:4</a></span>, desiring to gain credit from His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Therefore He answered somewhat vehemently,  saying,</p>

<h2>John 2:4</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour is not yet come.</q></div>

<p>To prove that He greatly respected His mother, hear Luke relate how He was <q>subject to</q> His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse51">Luke 2:51</a></span>, and our own Evangelist declare how He had forethought for her at the very season of the Crucifixion. For where <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> no impediment or hindrance in things belonging to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is our bounden duty to give way to them, and there is great danger in not doing so; but when they require anything unseasonably, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> hindrance in any spiritual matter, it is unsafe to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. And therefore He answered thus in this place, and again elsewhere, <q>Who is My mother, and who are My brethren?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse48">Matthew 12:48</a></span>, because they did not yet think rightly of Him; and she, because she had borne Him, claimed, according to the custom of other mothers, to direct Him in all things, when she ought to have reverenced and worshipped Him. This then was the reason why He answered as He did on that occasion. For consider what a thing it was, that when all the people high and low were standing round Him, when the multitude was intent on hearing  Him, and His doctrine had begun to be set forth, she should come into the midst and take Him away from the work of exhortation, and converse with Him apart, and not even endure to come within, but draw Him outside merely to herself. This is why He said, <q>Who is My mother and My brethren?</q> Not to insult her who had borne Him, (away with the thought!) but to procure her the greatest benefit, and not to let her think meanly of Him. For if He cared for others, and used every means to implant in them a becoming opinion of Himself, much more would He do so in the case of His mother. And since it was probable that if these words had been addressed to her by her Son, she would not readily have chosen even then to be convinced, but would in all cases have claimed the superiority as being His mother, therefore He replied as He did to them who spoke to Him; otherwise He could not have led up her thoughts from His present lowliness to His future exaltation, had she expected that she should always be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by Him as by a son, and not that He should come as her Master.</p>

<p>3. It was then from this motive that He said in this place, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> and also for another reason not less pressing. What was that? It was, that His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> might not be suspected. The request ought to have come from those who needed, not from His mother. And why so? Because what is done at the request of one's friends, great though it be, often causes offense to the spectators; but when they make the request who have the need, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> is free from suspicion, the praise unmixed, the benefit great. So if some excellent physician should enter a house where there were many sick, and be spoken to by none of the patients or their relations, but be  directed only by his own mother, he would be suspected  and disliked by the sufferers, nor would any of the patients or their attendants deem him able to exhibit anything great or remarkable. And so this was a reason why He rebuked her on that occasion, saying, <q>Woman, what have I to do with you?</q> instructing her for the future not to do the like; because, though He was careful to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> His mother, yet He cared much more for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and for the doing good to the many, for which He took upon Him the flesh.</p>

<p>These then were the words, not of one speaking rudely to his mother, but belonging to a wise dispensation, which brought her into a right frame of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and provided that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> should be attended with that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which was meet. And setting other things aside, this very appearance which these words have of having been spoken chidingly, is amply enough to show that He held her in high <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, for by His displeasure He showed that He reverenced her greatly; in what manner, we will say in the next discourse. Think of this then, and when you hear a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> saying, <q>Blessed is the womb that bare You, and the paps which You have sucked,</q> and Him answering, <q>rather blessed are they that do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my Father</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse27">Luke 11:27</a></span>, suppose that those other words also were said with the same intention. For the answer was not that of one rejecting his mother, but of One who would show that her having borne Him would have nothing availed her, had she not been very good and faithful. Now if, setting aside the excellence of her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, it profited Mary nothing that the Christ was born of her, much less will it be able to avail us to have a father or a brother, or a child of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and noble disposition, if we ourselves be far removed from his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <q>A brother,</q> says David, <q>does not redeem, shall man redeem?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa048.htm#verse7">Psalm 49:7</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> We must place our hopes of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in nothing else, but only in our own righteous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> (done) after  the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if this by itself could have availed,  it would have availed the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, (for Christ was their kinsman according to the flesh,) it would have availed the town in which He was born, it would have availed His brethren. But as long as His brethren cared not for themselves, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of their kindred availed them nothing, but they were condemned with the rest of the world, and then only were approved, when they shone by their own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and the city fell, and was burnt, having gained nothing from this; and His kinsmen according to the flesh were slaughtered and perished very miserably, having gained nothing towards being saved from their relationship to Him, because they had not the defense of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The Apostles, on the contrary, appeared greater than any, because they followed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and excellent way of gaining relationship with Him, that by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. And from this we learn that we have always need of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and a life shining and bright, since this alone will have power to save us. For though His relations were for a long time everywhere held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, being called the Lord's kinsmen,  yet now we do not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their names, while the lives and names of the Apostles are everywhere celebrated.</p>

<p>Let us then not be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> of nobleness of birth  according to the flesh, but though we have ten thousand famous ancestors, let us use diligence ourselves to go beyond their excellences, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that we shall gain nothing from the diligence of others to help us in the judgment that is to come; nay, this will be the more grievous condemnation, that though born of righteous <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and having an example at home, we do not, even thus, imitate our teachers. And this I say now, because I see many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>,  when we lead them to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and exhort them to become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, flying to their kinsmen and ancestors and house, and saying, <q>All my relations and friends and companions are faithful <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</q> What is that to you, thou wretched and miserable? This very thing will be especially your ruin, that you did not respect the number of those around you, and run to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Others again who are <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> but live a careless life, when exhorted to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> make the very same defense, and say, <q>my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather were very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and good men.</q> But this will assuredly most condemn you, that being descended from such men, you have acted unworthily of the root from whence you are sprung. For hear what the Prophet says to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> served for a wife, and for a wife he kept (sheep)</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/hos012.htm#verse12">Hosea 12:12</a></span>; and again Christ, <q>Your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John 8:56</a></span> And everywhere they bring forward  to them the righteous acts of their fathers, not only to praise them, but also to make the charge against their descendants more heavy. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> then this, let us use every means that we may be saved by our own works, lest having deceived ourselves by vain trusting on others, we learn that we have been deceived when the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of it will profit us nothing. <q>In the grave,</q> says David, <q>who shall give you thanks?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa006.htm#verse5">Psalm 6:5</a></span> Let us then repent here, that we may obtain the everlasting goods, which may God grant we all  do, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
