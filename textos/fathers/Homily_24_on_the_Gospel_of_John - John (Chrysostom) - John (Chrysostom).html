<h1>Homily 24 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 2:23</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, in the feast, many believed on Him.</q></div>

<p>1. Of the men of that time some clung to their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, others laid hold on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, while of these last, some having retained it for a little while again fell off from it. Alluding to these, Christ compared them to seeds not deeply sown, but having their roots upon the surface of the earth; and He said that they should quickly perish. And these the Evangelist has here pointed out to us, saying,</p>

<p><q>When He was in Jerusalem, at the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, in the feast, many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him,  when they saw the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He did.</q></p>

<h2>John 2:24</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>But Jesus did not commit Himself unto them.</q></div>

<p>For they were the more perfect  among His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who came to Him not only because of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but through His teaching also. The grosser sort the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> attracted, but the better reasoners His prophecies and doctrines; and so they who were taken by His teaching were more steadfast than those attracted by His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. And Christ also called them <q>blessed,</q> saying, <q>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse29">John 20:29</a></span> But that these here mentioned were not real <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, the following passage shows, for it says, <q>Jesus did not commit Himself unto them.</q> Wherefore? <q>Because He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all things,</q> </p>

<h2>John 2:25</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And needed not that any should testify of man, for He knew what was in man.</q></div>

<p>The meaning is of this kind. <q>He who dwells in men's hearts, and enters into their thoughts, took no heed of outward words; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> well that their warmth was but for a season, He placed not confidence in them as in perfect <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, nor committed all His doctrines to them as though they had already become firm <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>.</q> Now, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is in the heart of men belongs to God alone, <q>who has fashioned hearts one by one</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa032.htm#verse15">Psalm 33:15</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span>, for, says Solomon, <q>You, even Thou only, <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the hearts</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse39">1 Kings 8:39</a></span>; He therefore needed not witnesses to learn the thoughts of His own creatures, and so He felt no confidence in them because of their mere, temporary belief. Men, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> neither the present nor the future, often tell and entrust all without any reserve to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who approach them deceitfully and who shortly will fall off from them; but Christ did not so, for well He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all their secret thoughts.</p>

<p>And many such now there are, who have indeed the name of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but are unstable,  and easily led away; wherefore neither now does Christ commit Himself to them, but conceals from them many things; and just as we do not place confidence in mere acquaintances but in real friends, so also does Christ. Hear what He  says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Henceforth I call you not servants, you are My friends.</q> <span class="stiki">c. xv. 14, 15</span> Whence is this and why? <q>Because all things that I have heard of My Father I have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you.</q> And therefore He gave no signs to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who asked for them, because they asked tempting Him. Indeed the asking for signs is a practice of tempters both then and now; for even now there are some that seek them and say, <q>Why do not <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> take place also at this present time?</q> If you are faithful, as you ought to be, and lovest Christ as you ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, you have no need of signs, they are given to the unbelievers. <q>How then,</q> asks one, <q>were they not given to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>?</q> Given they certainly were; and if there were times when though they asked they did not receive them, it was because they asked them not that they might be delivered from their unbelief, but in order the more to confirm their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<h2>John 3:1-2</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus. The same came to Jesus by night and said to Him, 'Rabbi, we know that You are a Teacher come from God: for no man can do the miracles that You do, unless God is with him.'</q></div>

<p>This man appears also in the middle of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, making defense for Christ; for he says, <q>Our law judges no man  before it hear him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse51">John 7:51</a></span>; and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> replied to him, <q>Search and look, for out of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> arises no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</q> Again after the crucifixion he bestowed great care upon the burial of the Lord's body: <q>There came also,</q> says the Evangelist, <q><a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, which came to the Lord  by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse39">John 19:39</a></span> And even now he was disposed towards Christ,  but not as he ought, nor with proper sentiments respecting Him, for he was as yet entangled in Jewish infirmity. Wherefore he came by night, because he feared to do so by day. Yet not for this did the merciful God reject or rebuke him, or deprive him of His instruction, but even with much kindness conversed with him and disclosed to him very exalted doctrines, enigmatically indeed, but nevertheless He disclosed them. For far more deserving of pardon was he than those who acted thus through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. They are entirely without excuse; but he, though he was liable to condemnation, yet was not so to an equal degree. <q>How then does the Evangelist say nothing of the kind concerning him?</q> He has said in another place, that <q>of the rulers also many <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, but because of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>  they did not confess (Him), lest they should be put out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse42">John 12:42</a></span>; but here he has implied the whole by mentioning his coming <q>by night.</q> What then says <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>?</p>

<p><q>Rabbi, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You are a Teacher come from God: for no man can do the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that You do, except God be with him.</q></p>

<p>2. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> yet lingers  below, has yet <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thoughts concerning Him, and speaks of Him as of a Prophet, imagining nothing great from His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> he says, <q>that You are a Teacher come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>Why then do you come by night and secretly, to Him that speaks the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to Him who comes from God? Why do you not converse with Him openly?</q> But Jesus said nothing like this to him, nor did He rebuke him; for, says the Prophet, <q>A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench; He shall not strive nor cry</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa042.htm#verse2">Isaiah 42:2-3</a>; as quoted <a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse19">Matthew 12:19-20</a></span>: and again He says Himself, <q>I came not to condemn the world, but to save the world.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse47">John 12:47</a></span></p>

<p><q>No man can do these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, except God be with him.</q></p>

<p>Still here <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> speaks like the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, in saying, that He has a power working within Him,  and has need of the aid of others to do as He did. What then says Christ? Observe His exceeding condescension. He refrained for a while from saying, <q>I need not the help of others, but do all things with power, for I am the Very <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and have the same power as My Father,</q> because this would have been too hard for His hearer; for I say now what I am always saying, that what Christ desired was, not so much for a while to reveal His own Dignity, as to persuade men that He did nothing contrary to His Father. And therefore in many places he appears in words confined by limits,  but in His actions He does not so. For when He works a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, He does all with power, saying, <q>I will, be thou clean.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse3">Matthew 8:3</a></span> <q>Talitha, arise.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse41">Mark 5:41</a>; not verbally quoted</span> <q>Stretch forth your hand.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse5">Mark 3:5</a></span> <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be forgiven you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse2">Matthew 9:2</a></span> <q>Peace, be still.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse39">Mark 4:39</a></span> <q>Take up your bed, and go unto your house.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse6">Matthew 9:6</a></span> <q>Thou foul spirit, I say unto you, come out of him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse25">Mark 9:25</a>; not verbally quoted</span> <q>Be it unto you even as you will.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse28">Matthew 15:28</a></span> <q>If any one say (anything) unto you, you shall say, The Lord has need of him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar011.htm#verse3">Mark 11:3</a></span> <q>This day shall you be with Me in Paradise.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke 23:43</a></span> <q>You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not kill; but I say unto you, that whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, shall be in danger of the judgment.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse21">Matthew 5:21-22</a></span> <q>Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse17">Mark 1:17</a></span> And everywhere we observe that His authority is great; for in His actions no one  could find fault with what was done. How was it possible? Had His words not come to pass, nor been accomplished as He commanded, any one might have said that they were the commands of a madman; but since they did come to pass, the reality of their accomplishment stopped men's mouths even against their will. But with regard to His discourses, they might often in their insolence charge Him with <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. Wherefore now in the case of <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, He utters nothing openly, but by dark sayings leads him up from his low thoughts, teaching him, that He has sufficient power in Himself to show forth <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; for that His Father begot Him Perfect and All-sufficient, and without any imperfection.</p>

<p>But let us see how He effects this. <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> says, <q>Rabbi, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You are a Teacher come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for no man can do the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that You do, except God be with him.</q> He thought he had said something great when he had spoken thus of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. What then says Christ? To show that he had not yet set foot even on the threshold of right <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, nor stood in the porch, but was yet wandering somewhere without the palace, both he and whoever else should say the like, and that he had not so much as glanced towards <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> when he held such an opinion of the Only-Begotten, what says He?</p>

<h2>John 3:3</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God.</q></div>

<p>That is, <q>Unless you are born again and receive the right doctrines, you are wandering somewhere outside, and are far from the Kingdom of heaven.</q> But He does not speak so plainly as this. In order to make the saying less hard to bear, He does not plainly direct it at him, but speaks indefinitely, <q>Unless a man be born again</q>: all but saying, <q>both you and any other, who may have such opinions concerning Me, are somewhere outside the Kingdom.</q> Had He not spoken from a desire to establish this, His answer would have been suitable to what had been said. Now the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, if these words had been addressed to them, would have derided Him and departed; but <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> shows here also his desire of instruction.  And this is why in many places Christ speaks obscurely, because He wishes to rouse His hearers to ask questions, and to render them more attentive. For that which is said plainly often escapes the hearer, but what is obscure renders him more active and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>. Now what He says, is something like this: <q>If you are not born again, if you partake not of the Spirit which is by the washing  of Regeneration, you can not have a right opinion of Me, for the opinion which you have is not spiritual, but carnal.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus 3:5</a></span> But He did not speak thus, as refusing to confound  one who had brought such as he had, and who had spoken to the best of his ability; and He leads him unsuspectedly up to greater <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, saying, <q>Unless a man be born again.</q> The word <q>again,</q>  in this place, some understand to mean <q>from heaven,</q> others, <q>from the beginning.</q> <q>It is impossible,</q> says Christ, <q>for one not so born to see the Kingdom of God</q>; in this pointing to Himself, and declaring that there is another beside the natural sight, and that we have need of other eyes to behold Christ. Having heard this . . .</p>

<h2>John 3:4</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Nicodemus says, How can a man be born when he is old?</q></div>

<p>Callest thou Him <q>Master,</q> do you say that He is <q>come from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and yet do you not receive His words, but usest to your Teacher a manner of speaking which expresses  much perplexity? For the <q>How,</q> is the doubting question of those who have no strong belief, but who are yet of the earth. Therefore Sarah laughed when she had said, <q>How?</q> And many others having asked this question, have fallen from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>3. And thus <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> continue in their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, because they frequently make this enquiry, saying, some of them, <q>How was He begotten?</q> others, <q>How was He made flesh?</q> and subjecting that Infinite Essence to the weakness of their own reasonings.  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> which, we ought to avoid this unseasonable curiosity, for they who search into these matters shall, without learning the <q>How,</q> fall away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>. On this account <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, being in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, enquires the manner in which this can be, (for he understood that the words spoken referred to himself,) is confused, and dizzy,  and in perplexity, having come as to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and hearing more than man's words, and such as no one ever yet had heard; and for a while he rouses himself at the sublimity of the sayings, but yet is in darkness, and unstable, borne about in every direction, and continually falling away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And therefore he perseveres in proving the impossibility, so as to provoke Him to clearer teaching.</p>

<p><q>Can a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> he says, <q>enter into his mother's womb, and be born?</q></p>

<p>Do you see how when one commits spiritual things to his own reasonings, he speaks ridiculously, seems to be trifling, or to be drunken, when he pries into what has been said beyond what seems good to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and admits not the submission  of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> heard of the spiritual Birth, yet perceived it not as spiritual, but dragged down the words to the lowness of the flesh, and made a doctrine so great and high depend upon physical consequence. And so he invents frivolities, and ridiculous difficulties. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, <q>The natural  man receives not the things of the Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 2:14</a></span> Yet even in this he preserved his reverence for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for he did not mock at what had been said, but, deeming it impossible, held his peace. There were two difficulties; a Birth of this kind, and the Kingdom; for neither had the name of the Kingdom ever been heard among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor of a Birth like this. But he stops for a while at the first, which most astonished  his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>.</p>

<p>Let us then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, not enquire into things relating to God by reasoning, nor bring heavenly matters under the rule of earthly consequences, nor subject them to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of nature; but let us think of all reverently, believing as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> have said; for the busy and curious person gains nothing, and besides not finding what he seeks, shall suffer extreme punishment. You have heard, that (the Father) begot (the Son): <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what you have heard; but do ask not, <q>How,</q> and so take away the Generation; to do so would be extreme folly. For if this man, because, on hearing of a Generation, not that ineffable Generation, but this which is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he conceived nothing great concerning it, but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and earthly thoughts, was therefore darkened and in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, what punishment must they deserve, who are busy and curious about that most awful Generation, which transcends all reason and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>? For nothing causes such dizziness  as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasoning, all whose words are of earth, and which cannot endure to be enlightened from above. Earthly reasonings are full of mud, and therefore need we streams from heaven, that when the mud has settled, the clearer portion may rise and mingle with the heavenly lessons; and this comes to pass, when we present an honest <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and an upright life. For certainly it is possible for the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to be darkened, not only by unseasonable curiosity, but also by corrupt manners; wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has said to the Corinthians, <q>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able, for you are yet carnal; for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 3:2</a></span> And also in the Epistle to the Hebrews, and in many places, one may see <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> asserting that this is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrines; for that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possessed by <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>  cannot behold anything great or noble, but as if darkened by a sort of film  suffers most grievous dimsightedness.</p>

<p>Let us then cleanse ourselves, let us kindle the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, let us not sow among thorns. What the thorns are, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, though we tell you not; for often you have heard Christ call the cares of this present life, and the deceitfulness of riches, by this name. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse22">Matthew 13:22</a></span> And with reason. For as thorns are unfruitful, so are these things; as thorns tear those that handle them, so do these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>; as thorns are readily caught by the fire, and hateful by the husbandman, so too are the things of the world; as in thorns, wild beasts, and snakes, and scorpions hide themselves, so do they in the deceitfulness of riches. But let us kindle the fire of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that we may consume the thorns, and drive away the beasts, and make the field clear for the husbandman; and after cleansing it, let us water it with the streams of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, let us plant the fruitful olive, that most kindly of trees, the evergreen, the light-giving, the nutritious, the wholesome. All these qualities has almsgiving, which is, as it were, a seal on  those that possess it. This plant not even death when it comes causes to wither, but ever it stands enlightening the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, feeding the sinews  of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and rendering its strength mightier. And if we constantly possess it, we shall be able with confidence to behold the Bridegroom, and to enter into the bridal chamber; to which may we all attain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
