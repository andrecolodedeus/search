<h1>Homily 25 on the Acts of the Apostles</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse19">Acts XI. 19</a></p>

<p><q>Now they which were scattered abroad upon the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> that rose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, preaching the word to none but unto the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only.</q></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> turned out to be no slight benefit as <q>to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God all things work together for good.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans 8:28</a></span> If they had made it their express study how best to establish the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they would have done no other thing than this&mdash; they dispersed the teachers.  Mark in what quarters the preaching was extended. <q>They travelled,</q> it says, <q>as far as Phenice and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; to none however did they preach the word but to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only.</q> Do you mark with what wise purposes of Providence so much was done in the case of Cornelius? This serves both to justify Christ, and to impeach the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. When Stephen was slain, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was twice in danger, when the Apostles were scourged, then the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> received the word, then the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>. Which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also declares: <q>To you it was necessary that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> should first be spoken; but since you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy, lo, we turn unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act013.htm#verse46">Acts 13:46</a></span> Accordingly they went about, preaching to <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also. <q>But some of them were men of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Cyrene, who, when they had come to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, spoke unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus:</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse20">Acts 11:20</a></span> for it is likely both that they could now speak Greek, and that there were such men in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.  <q>And the hand of the Lord,</q> it says, <q>was with them,</q> that is, they wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; <q>and a great number <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and turned unto the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse21">Acts 11:21</a></span> Do you mark why now also there was heed of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> (namely) that they might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? <q>Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse22">Acts 11:22</a></span> What may be the reason that, when such a city received the word, they did not come themselves? Because of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. But they send Barnabas. However, it is no small part of the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> management even so that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> comes to be there. It is both natural, and it is wisely ordered, that they are averse to him, and (so) that Voice of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that Trumpet of heaven, is not shut up in Jerusalem. Do you mark how on all occasions, Christ turns their ill dispositions to needful account and for the benefit of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Of their <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> to the man, He availed Himself for the building up of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But observe this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man&mdash; Barnabas, I mean&mdash; how he looked not to his own interests, but hasted to Tarsus. <q>Who, when he came, and had seen the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart, they would cleave unto the Lord. For he was a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, and full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: and much people was added unto the Lord.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 23, 24.) He was a very kind man, and single-hearted, and considerate (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03B3;&#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>). <q>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse25">Acts 11:25</a></span> He came to the athletic wrestler, the general (fit to lead armies), the champion of single combat, the lion&mdash; I am at a loss for words, say what I will&mdash; the hunting-dog, killer of lions, bull of strength, lamp of brightness, mouth sufficing for a world. <q>And when he had found him, he brought him to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse26">Acts 11:26</a></span> Verily this is the reason why it was there they were appointed to be called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, because <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> there spent so long time! <q>And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and taught much people. And the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were first called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</q>  No small matter of praise to that city! This is enough to make it a match for all, that for so long a time it had the benefit of that mouth, it first, and before all others: wherefore also it was there in the first place that men were accounted worthy of that name. Do you observe the benefit resulting (to that city) from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, to what a height that name, like a standard (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03B7;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x1F35;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>), exalted it? Where three thousand, where five thousand, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, where so great a multitude, nothing of the sort took place, but they were called <q>they  of the way:</q> here they were called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <q>And in these days came <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> from Jerusalem unto <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse27">Acts 11:27</a></span> It was need that the fruit of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> should also be planted there. And see how of necessity (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B3;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>) (it comes about that) none of the men of note becomes their teacher. They got for their teachers, men of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and Cyrene, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>&mdash; though he indeed surpassed (the Apostles) themselves&mdash; since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also had for teachers Ananias and Barnabas. But  here of necessity (this was the case). <q>And there stood up one of them named <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>, and signified by the spirit that there would be great dearth throughout the world, which also came to pass in the days of Claudius C&aelig;sar.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse28">Acts 11:28</a></span> <q>By the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,</q> it says: for, that they may not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that this was the reason why the famine came, (namely) because <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> had come in, because the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were departed, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> foretells it: this, however, was nothing wonderful, for in fact Christ predicted it. Not this was the reason, else this must have been the case from the beginning: but it was because of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> done to the Apostles&mdash; and God had borne long with them; but, when they pressed upon them, a great famine ensues, betokening to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the coming woes. <q>If it was because of them, in any wise it ought to have stopped (there), when it did exist. What harm had the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> done, that they should have their share in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? They ought rather to have been marked as approved (<span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03BA;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x1F25;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>), because they were doing their part, were slaying, punishing, taking vengeance, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> on every side. And mark also at what time the famine comes: precisely when the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were thenceforth added to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if, as you say, it was because of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> (done by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>), these ought to have been exempted.</q> How so? Christ, forestalling this objection, said, <q>You shall have tribulation.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a></span> (It is) just as if you should say, They ought not to have been scourged either. <q>Then the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse29">Acts 11:29</a></span> Mark how the famine becomes to them the means of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, an occasion of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, a harbinger of many blessing. And (so it might have been) to you, one may say, if you were so minded, but you would not. But it is predicted, that they might be prepared beforehand for almsgiving. <q>Unto the brethren which dwelt in Jud&aelig;a;</q> for they were enduring great hardships, but before this, they were not suffering from famine. <q>Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse30">Acts 11:30</a></span> Do you mark them, that no sooner do they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> than they bring forth fruit, not only for their own but for those afar off? And Barnabas is sent and Saul, to minister (the same.) Of this occasion (&#x1FBF;<span class="greek">&#x0395;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x1F55;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;</span>) he says (to the Galatians), <q>And James, Cephas, and John gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, only</q> (they would) <q>that we should remember the poor.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse9">Galatians 2:9</a></span> James was yet living. </p>

<p><q>Now they which were scattered abroad upon the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>,</q> etc. (Recapitulation.) Do you mark how even in the tribulation instead of falling to lamentations and tears, as we do, they give themselves up to a great and good work? <q>Travelled as far as Phenice, and <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>,</q> and there with more security preached the word. <q>And some of them, which were men of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Cyrene,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse20">Acts 11:20</a></span> And they did not say, <q>(What), we, Cyrenians and Cyprians, to attack this splendid and great city!</q> but trusting in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they applied themselves to the work of teaching, nor did these (<a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>) themselves think scorn to learn anything of them. Mark how by small means all is brought about: mark the preaching how it spreads: mark those in Jerusalem, having like care for all, holding the whole world as one house. <q>They heard that <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> had received the word, and</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse14">Acts 8:14</a></span> to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> they send the Apostles: they heard what had befallen at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> they send Barnabas: they also send again, and (these) <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For the distance was great, and it was not meet the Apostles at present should separate from thence, that they might not be thought to be fugitives, and to have fled from their own people. But then, almost precisely, is the time of their parting from Jerusalem, when the state (of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>) was shown to be past remedy, when the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> was close at hand, and they must needs perish: when the sentence was made absolute. For, until <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> went to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the Apostles were there (at Jerusalem). But they depart, not because afraid of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>&mdash; how should it be so?&mdash; seeing those they went to, were those that should bring the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: and moreover the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> breaks out only after the Apostles were dead. For of them (the Apostles) says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> has come upon them unto the end.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse16">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a></span> The more insignificant the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the more illustrious the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, working great results by small means.&mdash; <q>And  he exhorted them to cleave unto the Lord, for he was a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 23, 24.) By <q><a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man,</q> I take it, he means one that is kind, (<span class="greek">&#x03C7;&#x03C1;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F78;&#x03BD;</span>) sincere, exceedingly desirous of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his neighbors&mdash; <q>for he was a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, and full of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. To  cleave unto the Lord with purpose of heart</q> (this is said): with encomium and praise. <q>And much people was added unto the Lord:</q> for like rich land this city received the word, and brought forth much fruit. <q>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse25">Acts 11:25</a></span> But why did he take him off from Tarsus and bring him here? Not without good reason; for here were both good hopes, and a greater city, and a great body of people. See how <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> works all, not  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: by small means the affair was taking its commencement. When it has become difficult the Apostles take it up. Why did they not before this seen Barnabas? Because they had enough to do (<span class="greek">&#x1F20;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C7;&#x1F79;&#x03BB;&#x03B7;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;</span>) with Jerusalem. Again they justified themselves  to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were receiving (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x1F71;&#x03BC;&#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;</span>) the word, even without enjoying so great attention. There is about to be a questioning: therefore the affair of Cornelius forestalled it. Then indeed they say, <q>That we to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and they to the Circumcision.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse9">Galatians 2:9</a></span> Observe, henceforth the very stress of the famine introduces the fellowship on the part of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, namely, from the <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>. For they receive the offerings sent from them.</p>

<p><q>Now  they which were scattered abroad,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse19">Acts 11:19</a></span> and not as we who pass our time in lamentations and tears, in our calamities; but with more fearlessness they passed their time, as having got to a distance from those hindering them, and as being among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> not afraid of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: which also helped. And they came to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, where they had the sea between them, and greater freedom from anxiety: so  they made no account of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but (still) they gave the precedence to the regard of the Law: <q>they spoke to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> only. But there were in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> certain men of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and Cyrene:</q> these, of all others, least cared for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>who spoke unto the Greeks, preaching the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse20">Acts 11:20</a></span> Probably it was because of their not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Hebrew, that they called them Greeks. And <q>when</q> Barnabas, it says, <q>came and had seen the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>&mdash; not the diligence of men&mdash; <q>he exhorted them to cleave unto the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse23">Acts 11:23</a></span>: and by this he converted more. <q>And much people was added unto the Lord.</q> Why do they not write to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but send Barnabas? They did not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the man: but it is providentially ordered that Barnabas should come. As there was a multitude, and none to hinder, well might the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> grow, and above all because they had no trials to undergo. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also preaches, and is no longer compelled to flee. And it is well ordered, that not they speak of the famine, but the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. The men of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> also did not take it amiss that they sent not the Apostles, but were content with their teachers: so fervent were they all for the word. They did not wait for the famine to come, but before this they sent: <q>according as each had the ability.</q> And observe, among the Apostles, others are put in charge with this trust, but here <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>. For this was no small order (<span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>) of Providence. Besides, it was the beginning, and it was not fit they should be offended.</p>

<p><q>As each had the ability, they sent.</q> But now, none does this, although there is a famine more grievous than that. For the cases are not alike, for (all) to bear the calamity in common, and, while all (the rest) abound, for the poorer to be famishing. And the expression shows that the givers also were poor, for, it says, <q>as each of them had the means.</q> A twofold famine, even as the abundance is twofold: a severe famine, a famine not of hearing the word of the Lord, but of being nourished by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>.  Then, both the poor in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> enjoyed the benefit, and so did those in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> who gave their money; yea, these more than those: but now, both we and the poor are famishing: they being in lack of necessary sustenance, and we in luxurious living,  lacking the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But this is a food, than which nothing can be more necessary. This is not a food, from which one has to undergo the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of repletion: not a food, of which the most part ends in the draught. (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03B5;&#x03B4;&#x03C1;&#x1F65;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;</span>.) Nothing more beauteous, nothing more healthful, than a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nurtured by this food: it is set high above all disease, all pestilence, all indigestion and distemper: none shall be able to overcome it, (<span class="greek">&#x1F11;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x1F35;&#x03BD;</span>) but just as, if one's body were made of adamant, no iron, nor anything else, would have power to hurt it, even so when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is firmly compact by almsgiving, nothing at all shall be able to overcome it. For say, what shall spoil this? Shall poverty? It cannot be, for it is laid up in the royal treasuries. But shall robber and housebreaker? Nay, those are walls which none shall be able to break through. But shall the worm? Nay, this treasure is set far above the reach of this mischief also. But shall <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> eye? Nay, neither by these can it be overcome. But shall false accusations and plottings of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? No, neither shall this be, for safe as in an asylum is this treasure. But it were a shame should I make it appear as if the advantages which belong to almsgiving were only these (the absence of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>), and not (the presence of) their opposites. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is not merely that it is secure from ill-will; it also gets abundant blessing from those whom it benefits. For as the cruel and unmerciful not only have for enemies those whom they have injured, but those also who are not themselves hurt, partake the grief and join in the accusation: so those that have done great good have not only those who are benefited, but those also who are not themselves affected, to speak their praises. Again (that), it is secure from the attacks of the evil-disposed, and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and housebreakers&mdash; what, is this all the good, or is it this&mdash; that besides the not suffering diminution, it grows also and increases into multitude? What more shameful than <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, what more foul, what more iniquitous? The man was impious; after tokens and signs without number he refused to come to his senses (<span class="greek">&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03B3;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x1F35;&#x03BD;</span>), but cast the servants of God into a furnace: and (yet) after these doings, he worshipped. What then said the Prophet? <q>Wherefore,</q> says he, <q>O king let my counsel be acceptable unto you, ransom (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F7B;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and your iniquities by mercies to the poor: perhaps there shall be pardon for your transgressions.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse27">Daniel 3:27</a></span> In so speaking, he said it not doubting, nay, with entire confidence, but wishing to put him in greater <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and to make a stronger necessity of doing these things. For if he had spoken it as a thing unquestionable, the king would have been more supine: just as it is with us, we then most urge some person (whom we wish to persuade), when  they say to us, <q>Exhort such an one,</q> and do not add, <q>he will be sure to hear,</q> but only, <q>perhaps he will hear:</q> for by leaving it doubtful, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is made greater, and urges him the more. This is the reason why the Prophet did not make the thing certain to him. What do you say? For so great impieties shall there be pardon? Yes. There is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> cannot cleanse, none, which <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> cannot quench: all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is beneath this: it is a medicine adapted for every wound. What worse than a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>? The very matter (<span class="greek">&#x1F51;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>) (of his occupation) is altogether one of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>: and yet Zaccheus washed away all these (<a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>). Mark how even Christ shows this, by the care taken to have a purse, and to bear the contributions put into it. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says, <q>Only that we remember the poor</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse10">Galatians 2:10</a></span>: and everywhere the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has much discourse concerning this matter. <q>The ransom,</q> it says, <q>of a man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is his own <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse8">Proverbs 13:8</a></span>: and with reason: for, says (Christ), <q>if you would be perfect, sell what you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and come, follow Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a></span> This may well be part of perfection. But <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> may be done not only by money, but by acts. For example: one may kindly stand (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F25;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) by a person (to succor and defend him), one may reach to him a helping hand: the service rendered (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>) by acts has often done more good even than money. Let us set to work all the different kinds of almsgiving. Can you do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> by money? Be not slack. Can you by good offices? Say not, Because I have no money, this is nothing. This is a very great point: look upon it as if you had given gold. Can you do it by kind attentions (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>)? Do this also. For instance, if you be a physician, (give) your skill: for this also is a great matter. Can you by counsel? This (service) is much greater than all: this (<a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>) is better than all, or it is also more, by how much the gain it has is greater. For in so doing you put away not starvation, but a grievous death. <span class="stiki">ch. 3:6; 6:4</span> With such <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> the Apostles above measure abounded: therefore it was that the distribution of money they put into the hands of those after them, themselves exhibiting the (mercy) shown by words. Or is it, think you, a small <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, to a lost, castaway <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in uttermost jeopardy, possessed by a burning fever (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F7D;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>), to be able to rid it of its disease? For example, do you see one possessed by <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>? Pity the man. Is he in danger of suffocation? Quench his fire. <q>What if he will not be persuaded?</q> Do your part, and be not remiss. Have you seen him in bonds?&mdash; for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is indeed bonds. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse35">Matthew 25:35</a> ff.</span> Go to him, visit him, console him, try to release him of his bonds. If he refuse, he shall bear the blame himself. Have you seen him naked, and a stranger?&mdash; for he is indeed naked, and a stranger to heaven. Bring him to your own inn, clothe him with the garment of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, give him the city which is in heaven. <q>What if I myself be naked?</q> say you. Clothe also yourself first: if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are naked, assuredly you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you need to be clothed; if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what sort of nakedness this is.  What numbers of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> now wear silken apparel but are indeed naked of the garments of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>! Let their husbands clothe these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <q>But they will not admit those garments; they choose to have these.</q> Then do this also first: induce them to have a longing for those garments: show them that they are naked: speak to them of judgment to come: answer me,  what is the clothing we shall need there? But if you will bear with me, I also will show you this nakedness. He that is naked, when it is cold, shrinks and shudders, and stands there cowering, and with his arms folded: but in summer heat, not so. If then I shall prove to you that your rich men, and rich <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the more they put on, the more naked they are, do not take it amiss. How then, I ask you, when we raise the subject of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell-fire</a>, and of the torments there? Do not these shrink and shudder more than those naked ones? Do they not bitterly groan and condemn themselves? What? When they come to this or that man, and say to him, Pray for me, do they not speak the same words as those (naked wretches)?</p>

<p>Now indeed, after all that we can say, the nakedness is not yet apparent: but it will be plain enough there. How, and in what way? When these silken garments and precious stones shall have perished, and it shall be only by the garments of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are shown, when the poor shall be clad with exceeding <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but the rich, naked and in disgraceful sort, shall be haled away to their punishments. What more naked (Edd. <q>more dainty</q>) than that rich man who arrayed himself in purple? What poorer than Lazarus? Then which of them uttered the words of beggars? Which of them was in abundance? Say, if one should deck his house with abundance of tapestry hangings, and himself sit naked within, what were the benefit? So it is in the case of these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Truly, the house of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the body I mean, they hang round with plenty of garments: but the mistress of the house sits naked within. Lend me the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and I will show you the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> nakedness. For what is the garment of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Virtue, of course. And what its nakedness? Vice. For just as, if one were to strip any decent person, that person would be ashamed, and would shrink and cower out of sight; just so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, if we wish to see it, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has not these garments, blushes for shame. How many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, think you, at this moment feel ashamed, and would fain sink to the very depth, as if seeking some sort of curtain, or screen, that they may not hear these words? But those who have no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, are exhilarated, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, find delight, and gayly deck themselves (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03B3;&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x03C9;&#x03C0;&#x1F77;&#x03B6;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) with the things said. Hear concerning that blessed Thekla,  how, that she might see <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, she gave even her gold: and you will not give even a farthing that you may see Christ: you admire what she did, but dost not emulate her. Do you not hear that <q>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse7">Matthew 5:7</a></span> What is the gain of your costly garments? How long shall we continue agape for this attire? Let us put on the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Christ: let us array ourselves with that beauty, that both here we may be praised, and there attain unto the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with Whom, to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> together, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, dominion, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
