<h1>Homily 26 on Second Corinthians</h1>

<h2>2 Corinthians 12:1</h2>

<p> <em>It is not expedient for me doubtless to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></em>,  <em>[for] I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</em></p>

<p>What is this? Does he who has spoken such great things say, [It is not expedient] <q>doubtless to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> as if he had said nothing? No; not as if he had said nothing: but because he is going to pass to another species of boasting, which is not intended indeed by so great a reward, but which to the many (though not to careful examiners) seems to set him off in brighter colors , he says, <q>It is not expedient for me doubtless to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the great grounds of boasting were those which he had recounted, those of his trials; he has however other things also to tell of, such as concern the revelations, the unspeakable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. And wherefore, says he, <q>It is not expedient for me?</q> he means, 'lest it lift me up to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.' What do you say? For if you speak not of them, yet do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of them? But our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of them ourselves does not lift us up so much as our publishing them to others. For it is not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that uses to lift a man up, but their being witnessed to, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of, by the many. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> therefore he says, <q>It is not expedient for me;</q> and, 'that I may not implant too great an idea of me in those who hear.' For those men indeed, the false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, said even what was not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> about themselves; but this man hides even what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and that too although so great necessity lies upon him, and says, <q>It is not expedient for me;</q> teaching one and all even to superfluity  to avoid any thing of the sort. For this thing  is attended with no advantage, but even with harm, except there be some necessary and useful reason which induces us thereto. Having then spoken of his perils, trials, snares, dejections, shipwrecks, he passes to another species of boasting, saying,</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 12:2-5</h2>

<p><q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; or out of the body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>;) such an one caught up even to the third heaven. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how that he was caught up into Paradise, (whether in the body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not; or out of the body, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not;) and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful  for a man to utter. On behalf of such an one will I <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: but on my own behalf I will not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q></p>

<p>Great indeed was this revelation. But this was not the only one: there were many others besides, but he mentions one out of many. For that there were many, hear what he says: <q>Lest I should be exalted overmuch through the exceeding greatness of the revelations.</q> 'And yet,' a man may say, 'if he wished to conceal them, he ought not to have given any intimation  whatever or said any thing of the sort; but if he wished to speak of them, to speak plainly.' Wherefore then is it that he neither spoke plainly nor kept silence? To show by this  also that he resorts to the thing unwillingly. And therefore also he has stated the time, <q>fourteen years.</q> For he does not mention it without an object, but to show that he who had refrained for so long a time would not now have spoken out, except the necessity for doing so had been great. But he would have still kept silence, had he not seen the brethren perishing. Now if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> from the very beginning was such an one as to be counted worthy of such a revelation, when as yet he had not wrought such good works; consider what he must have grown to in fourteen years. And observe how even in this very matter he shows modesty, by his saying some things, but confessing that of others he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. For that he was caught up indeed, he declared, but whether <q>in the body</q> or <q>out of the body</q> he says he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And yet it would have been quite enough, if he had told of his being caught up and had been silent [about the other]; but as it is, in his modesty he adds this also. What then? Was it the mind that was caught up and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, while the body remained dead? Or was the body caught up? It is impossible to tell. For if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who was caught up and whom things unspeakable, so many and so great, had befallen was in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, much more we. For, indeed, that he was in Paradise he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, and that he was in the third heaven he was not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, but the manner he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not clearly. And see from yet another consideration how free he is from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For in his narrative about <q>the city of the Damascenes</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse32">2 Corinthians 11:32</a></span> he confirms what he says, but here not; for it was not his aim to establish this fact strongly, but to mention and intimate it only. Wherefore also he goes on to say, <q>Of such an one will I <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>;</q> not meaning that he who was caught up was some other person, but he so frames his language in the best manner he possibly could, so as at once to mention the fact, and to avoid speaking of himself openly. For what sequence would there be in bringing some one else forward, when discoursing about himself? Wherefore then did he so put it? It was not all one to say, 'I was caught up,' and, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> one that was caught up;</q> and 'I will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of myself,' and, <q>I will <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of such an one.</q> Now if any should say, 'And how is it possible to be caught up without a body?' I will ask him, 'How is it possible to be caught up with a body?' for this is even more inexplicable than the other, if you examine by reasonings and do not give place to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>2. But wherefore was he also caught up? As I think, that he might not seem to be inferior to the rest of the Apostles. For since they had companied with Christ, but <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had not: He therefore caught up unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> him also. <q>Into Paradise.</q> For great was the name of this place, and it was everywhere celebrated. Wherefore also Christ said, <q>Today you shall be with Me in Paradise.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke 23:43</a></span></p>

<p><q>On behalf of such an one will I <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> wherefore? For if another were caught up, wherefore do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? Whence it is evident that he said these things of himself. And if he added, <q>but of myself I will not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> he says nothing else than this, that, 'when there is no necessity, I will say nothing of that kind fruitlessly and at random;' or else he is again throwing obscurity over  what he had said, as best he might. For that the whole discourse was about himself, what follows also clearly shows; for he went on to say,</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 12:6</h2>

<p><q>But if I should even desire to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<p>How then did you say before, <q>Would that you could bear with me a little in my foolishness;</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse1">2 Corinthians 11:1</a></span> and, <q>That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly;</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 11:17</a></span> but here, <q>Though I should even desire to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, I shall not be foolish?</q> Not in regard of glorying, but of lying; for if glorying be foolishness, how much more lying?</p>

<p>It is then with regard to this that he says, <q>I shall not be foolish.</q> Wherefore also he added,</p>

<p><q>For I shall speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he sees , or that he hears from me.</q> Here you have the acknowledged reason; for they even deemed them to be gods, on account of the greatness of their <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. As then in the case of the elements, God has done both things, creating them at once weak and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>; the one, to proclaim His own power; the other, to prevent the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> : so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> here also were they both wonderful and weak, so that by the facts themselves were the unbelievers instructed. For if while continuing to be wonderful only and giving no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of weakness, they had by words tried to draw away the many from conceiving of them more than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; not only would they have nothing succeeded, but they would even have brought about the contrary. For those dissuasions in words would have seemed rather to spring of lowliness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and would have caused them to be the more admired. Therefore in act and by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> was their weakness disclosed. And one may see this exemplified in the men who lived under the old dispensation. For Elias was wonderful, but on one occasion he stood convicted of faint-heartedness; and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was great, but he also fled  under the influence of the same passion. Now such things befell them, because God stood aloof and permitted their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> to stand confessed. For if because he led them out they said, 'Where is <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>?' what would they not have said, if he had also led them in? Wherefore also [<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>] himself says, <q>I forbear, lest any should account of me.</q> He said not, 'say of me,' but, <q>lest any should even account of me</q> beyond my desert.' Whence it is evident from this also that the whole discourse relates to himself. Wherefore even when he began, he said, <q>It is not expedient for me doubtless to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> which he would not have said, had he been going to speak the things which he said of another man. For wherefore is it <q>not expedient to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> about another? But it was himself that was counted worthy of these things; and therefore it is that he goes on to say,</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 12:7</h2>

<p><q>And that I should not be exalted overmuch, through the exceeding greatness of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, to buffet me.</q></p>

<p>What do you say? He that counted not the kingdom to be any thing; no, nor yet <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> in respect of his longing after Christ; did he deem <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from the many to be any thing, so as both to be lifted up and to need that curb continually? For he did not say, 'that he <q>might</q> buffet  me,' but <q>that he</q> may <q>buffet  me.</q> Yet who is there would say this? What then is the meaning of what is said? When we have explained what is meant at all by the <q>thorn,</q> and who is this <q>messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> then will we declare this also. There are some then who have said that he means a kind of pain in the head which was inflicted of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; but God forbid! For the body of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> never could have been given over to the hands of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself submitted to the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> at his mere bidding; and he set him <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and bounds, when he delivered over the fornicator for the destruction of the flesh, and he dared not to transgress them. What then is the meaning of what is said? An adversary is called, in the Hebrew, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; and in the third Book of Kings the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has so termed such as were adversaries; and speaking of Solomon, says, 'In his days there was no <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,' that is, no adversary, enemy, or opponent. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ki005.htm#verse4">1 Kings 5:4</a></span> What he says then is this: God would not permit the Preaching to progress, in order to check our high thoughts; but permitted the adversaries to set upon us. For this indeed was enough to pluck down his high thoughts; not so that, pains in the head. And so by the <q>messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> he means Alexander the coppersmith, the party of Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus, all the adversaries of the word; those who contended with and fought against him, those that cast him into a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, those that beat him, that led him away to death ; for they did <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> business. As then he calls those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who were imitating his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so also he calls a <q>messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a></q> every one that opposes. He says therefore, <q>There was given to me a thorn to buffet me;</q> not as if God puts arms into such men's hands, God forbid! not that He does chastise or punish, but for the time allows and permits them. </p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 12:8</h2>

<p>3. <q>Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice.</q></p>

<p>That is, oftentimes. This also is a mark of great lowliness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, his not concealing that he could not bear those insidious plottings, that he fainted under them and was reduced to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for deliverance.</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 12:9</h2>

<p><q>And He said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you; for my power is made perfect in weakness.</q></p>

<p>That is to say, 'It is sufficient for you that you raise the dead, that you cure the blind, that you cleanse <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, that you work those other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; seek not also exemption from danger and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and to preach without annoyances. But are you pained and dejected lest it should seem to be owing to My weakness, that there are many who plot against and beat you and harass and scourge you? Why this very thing does show My power. <q>For My power,</q> He says, <q>is made perfect in weakness,</q> when being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> ye overcome your persecutors; when being harassed ye get the better of them that harass you; when being put in bonds ye convert them that put you in bonds. Seek not then more than is needed.' Do you see how he himself assigns one reason, and God another? For he himself says, <q>Lest I should be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn;</q> but he says that God said He permitted it in order to show His power. 'You seek therefore a thing which is not only not needed, but which also obscures the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of My power.' For by the words, <q>is sufficient for you,</q> He would signify this, that nothing else need be added, but the whole was complete. So that from this also it is plain that he does not intend pains in the head; for in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they did not preach when they were sick, for they could not preach when ill; but that harassed and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, they overcame all. 'After having heard this then,' he says,</p>

<p><q>Most gladly therefore will I <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in my weaknesses.</q> For that they may not sink down, when those false Apostles are glorying over their contrary lot  and these are suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he shows that he shines all the brighter for this, and that thus the power of God shines forth the rather, and what happens is just matter for glorying. Wherefore he says, <q>Most gladly therefore will I <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> 'Not as therefore sorrowing did I speak of the things which I enumerated, or of that which I have just now said, <q>there was given to me a thorn;</q> but as priding myself upon them and drawing to myself greater power.' Wherefore also he adds,</p>

<p><q>That the strength of Christ may rest upon me.</q> Here he hints at another thing also, namely, that in proportion as the trials waxed in intensity, in the same proportion the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was increased and continued.</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 12:10</h2>

<p><q>Wherefore I take pleasure in many weaknesses.</q>  Of what sort? Tell me. <q>In injuries, in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, in necessities, in distresses.</q></p>

<p>Do you see how he has now revealed it in the clearest manner? For in mentioning the species of the infirmity he spoke not of fevers, nor any return  of that sort, nor any other bodily ailment, but of <q>injuries, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, distresses.</q> Do you see a single-minded <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? He longs to be delivered from those dangers; but when he heard God's answer that this befits not, he was not only not sorry that he was disappointed of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but was even glad. Wherefore he said, <q>I take pleasure,</q> 'I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, I long, to be injured, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, distressed for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake.' And he said these things both to check those, and to raise the spirits of these that they might not be ashamed at <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> sufferings. For that ground  was enough to make them shine brighter than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Then he mentions another reason also.</p>

<p><q>For when I am weak, then am I strong.</q> 'Why do you marvel that the power of God is then conspicuous? I too am strong <q>then;</q>' for then most of all did <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> come upon him. <q>For as His sufferings abound, so does our consolation abound also.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 1:5</a></span></p>

<p>4. Where affliction is, there is also consolation; where consolation, there is <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also. For instance when he was thrown into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, then it was he wrought those marvellous things; when he was shipwrecked and cast away upon that barbarous country, then more than ever was he <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. When he went bound into the judgment-hall, then he overcame even the judge. And so it was too in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>; by  their trials the righteous flourished. So it was with the three children, so with Daniel, with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and Joseph; thence did they all shine and were counted worthy of great crowns. For then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also is purified, when it is afflicted for God's sake: it then enjoys greater assistance as needing more help and worthy of more <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, before the reward which is proposed to it by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it reaps a rich harvest of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things by becoming <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a>. For affliction rends <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> away and prunes out all listlessness and exercises  unto patience: it reveals the meanness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things and leads unto much <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. For all the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> give way before it, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, emulation, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, rule,  desire of riches, of beauty , boastfulness, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; and the whole remaining swarm of these distempers. And if you desire to see this in actual working, I shall be able to show you both a single individual and a whole people, as well under affliction as at ease; and so to teach you how great advantage comes of the one, and how great listlessness from the other.</p>

<p>For the people of the Hebrews, when they were vexed and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, groaned and besought <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and drew down upon themselves great influences  from above: but when they waxed fat, they kicked. The Ninevities again, when they were in the enjoyment of security, so exasperated God that He threatened to pluck up the entire city from its foundations: but after they had been humbled by that preaching, they displayed all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.  But if you would see also a single individual, consider Solomon. For he, when deliberating with anxiety and trouble concerning the government of that nation, was vouchsafed that vision: but when he was in the enjoyment of luxury, he slid into the very pit of iniquity. And what did his father? When was he admirable and passing belief? Was it not when he was in trials? And Absalom, was he not sober-minded, while still an exile; but after his return, became both tyrannical and a parricide? And what did Job? He indeed shone even in prosperity, but showed yet brighter after his affliction. And why must one speak of the old and ancient things? For if one do but examine our own state at present, he will see how great is the advantage of affliction. For now indeed that we are in the enjoyment of peace, we have become supine, and lax  and have filled the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with countless <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; but when we were <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, we were more sober-minded, and kinder, and more earnest, and more ready as to these assemblies and as to hearing. For what fire is to gold, that is affliction unto <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; wiping away filth, rendering men clean, making them bright and shining. It leads unto the kingdom, that unto <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. And therefore the one way is broad, the other narrow. Wherefore also, He Himself said, <q>In the world you shall have tribulation,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a></span> as though he were leaving some great good behind unto us. If then you are a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, travel thou the straight and narrow way, and be not disgusted nor discouraged.  For even if you be not afflicted in that way; you must inevitably be afflicted on other grounds, of no advantage to you. For the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> man also, and the lover of money, and he that burns for an harlot, and the vainglorious, and each one of the rest that follow whatsoever is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, endures many disheartenings and afflictions, and is not less afflicted than they who mourn. And if he does not weep nor mourn, it is for shame and insensibility: since if you should look into his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, you will see it filled with countless waves. Since then whether we follow this way of life or that, we must needs be afflicted: wherefore choose we not this way which along with affliction brings crowns innumerable? For thus has God led all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> through affliction and distress, at once doing them service, and securing the rest of men against entertaining a higher opinion of them than they deserve. For thus it was that idolatries gained ground at first; men being held in admiration beyond their desert. Thus the Roman senate decreed Alexander  to be the thirteenth <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for it possessed the privilege of electing and enrolling Gods. For instance, when all about Christ had been reported, the ruler of the nation  sent to inquire, whether they would be pleased to elect Him also a God. They however refused their consent, being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and indignant that previous to their vote and decree, the Power of the Crucified flashing abroad had won over the whole world to its own worship. But thus it was ordered even against their will that the Divinity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not proclaimed by man's decree, nor was He counted one of the many that were by them elected. For they counted even boxers to be Gods, and the favorite of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Hadrian</a>; after whom the city Antinous is named. For since death testifies against their moral nature, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> invented another way, that of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; and mingling therewith that excessive flattery, he seduced many into impiety. And observe what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> artifice. When we advance that doctrine for a good purpose, he overthrows our words; but when he himself is desirous of framing an argument for mischief, he is very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in setting it up. And if any one ask, 'How is Alexander a God? Is he not dead? And miserably too?' 'Yes, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>?' he replies. Now you argue and philosophizest for <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, to detach men from the God Who is over all: but when we declare that this is God's greatest gift, you persuade your dupes that men are low and grovelling, and in no better case than the brutes. And if we say, 'the Crucified lives,' laughter follows immediately: although the whole world proclaims it, both in old time and now; in old time by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, now by converts; for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> these successes are not those of a dead man: but if one say, 'Alexander lives,' you believe, although you have no <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> to allege.</p>

<p>5. 'Yes,' one replies; 'I have; for when he lived he wrought many and great achievements; for he subdued both nations and cities, and in many <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and battles he conquered, and erected trophies.'</p>

<p>If then I shall show [somewhat] which he when alive never dreamed of, neither he, nor any other man that ever lived, what other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the resurrection will you require? For that while alive one should win battles and victories, being a king and having armies at his disposal, is nothing marvelous, no, nor startling or novel; but that after a Cross and Tomb one should perform such great things throughout every land and sea, this it is which is most especially replete with such amazement, and proclaims His divine and unutterable Power. And Alexander indeed after his decease never restored again his kingdom which had been rent in pieces and quite abolished: indeed how was it likely he, dead, should do so? But Christ then most of all set up His after He was dead. And why speak I of Christ? Seeing that He granted to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also, after their deaths, to shine? For, tell me, where is the tomb of Alexander? Show it me and tell me the day on which he died. But of the servants of Christ the very tombs are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, seeing they have taken possession of the most loyal city; and their days are well known, making festivals for the world. And his tomb even his own people <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, but this man's  the very barbarians <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. And the tombs of the servants of the Crucified are more splendid than the palaces of kings; not for the size and beauty of the buildings, (yet even in this they surpass them,) but, what is far more, in the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of those who frequent them. For he that wears the purple himself goes to embrace those tombs, and, laying aside his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, stands begging the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>  to be his advocates with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and he that has the diadem implores the tent-maker and the fisherman, though dead, to be his patrons. Will you dare then, tell me, to call the Lord of these dead; whose servants even after their decease are the patrons of the kings of the world? And this one may see take place not in Rome only, but in Constantinople also. For there also <a href="../cathen/04295c.htm">Constantine the Great</a>, his son considered he should be honoring with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, if he buried him in the porch of the fisherman; and what porters are to kings in their palaces, that kings are at the tomb to fisherman. And these indeed as lords of the place occupy the inside, while the others as though but sojourners and neighbors were glad to have the gate of the porch assigned them; showing by what is done in this world, even to the unbelievers, that in the Resurrection the fisherman will be yet more their superiors. For if here it is so in the burial [of each], much more will it in the resurrection. And their rank is interchanged; kings assume that of servants and ministers, and subjects the dignity of kings, yea rather a brighter still. And that this is no piece of flattery, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself demonstrates; for by those these have become more illustrious. For far greater reverence is paid to these tombs than to the other royal sepulchres; for there indeed is profound solitude, while here there is an immense concourse. But if you will compare these tombs with the royal palaces, here again the palm remains with them. For there indeed there are many who keep off, but here many who invite and draw to them rich, poor, men, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, bond, free; there, is much <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; here, pleasure unutterable. 'But,' says one, 'it is a sweet sight to look on a king covered with gold and crowned, and standing by his side, generals, commanders, captains of horse and foot, lieutenants.' Well, but this of ours is so much grander and more awful that that must be judged, compared with it, to be stage scenery  and child's play. For the instant you have stepped across the threshold, at once the place sends up your thoughts to heaven, to the King above, to the army of the Angels, to the lofty throne, to the unapproachable <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. And here indeed He has put in the ruler's power, of his subjects to loose one, and bind another; but the bones of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> possess no such pitiful and mean authority, but that which is far greater. For they summon <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and put them to the torture, and loose from those bitterest of all bonds, them that are bound. What is more fearful than this tribunal? Though no one is seen, though no one piles the sides of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, yet are there cries, and tearings , lashes, tortures, burning tongues, because the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> cannot endure that marvellous power. And they that once wore bodies, are victorious over bodiless powers; [their] dust and bones and ashes rack those invisible natures. And therefore in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is that none would ever travel abroad to see the palaces of kings, but many kings and have often traveled to see this spectacle. For the Martyries  of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> exhibit outlines and <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of the judgment to come; in that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are scourged, men chastened and delivered. Do you see the power of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, even dead? Do you see the weakness of sinners, even living? Flee then <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that you may have power over such; and pursue <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with all your might. For if the case be thus here, consider what it will be in the world to come. And as being evermore possessed with this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, lay hold on the life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; whereunto may we all attain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards men of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with Whom to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, might, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
