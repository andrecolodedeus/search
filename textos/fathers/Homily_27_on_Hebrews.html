<h1>Homily 27 on Hebrews</h1>

<h2>Hebrews 11:28-31</h2>

<p><q> <em>Through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he kept the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> should touch them. By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they passed through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, as by dry land; which the Egyptians assaying to do, were drowned.</em>  <em> By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> fell down, after they had been compassed about seven days. By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the harlot Rahab perished not with them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, when she had received the spies with peace.</em></q></p>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is wont to establish many things incidently, and is very full  of thoughts. For such is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of The Spirit. He does not comprehend a few ideas in a multitude of words, but includes great and manifold thought in brevity of expressions. Observe at least how, in the midst  of exhortation, and when discoursing about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of what a type and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> he reminds us, whereof we have the reality. <q>Through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q> (he says) <q>he kept the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> should touch them.</q></p>

<p>But what is <q>the sprinkling of blood</q>?  A lamb was slain in every household, and the blood was smeared on the door-posts, and this was a means of warding off the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> destruction. If then the blood of a lamb preserved the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> unhurt in the midst of the Egyptians, and under so great a destruction, much more will the blood of Christ save us, who have had it sprinkled  not on the door-posts, but in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For even now also the Destroyer is going about in this depth of night: but let us be armed with that Sacrifice. (He calls the <q>sprinkling</q>  anointing.) For God has brought us out from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, from darkness, from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</p>

<p>Although what was done, was nothing, what was achieved was great. For what was done was blood; but was achieved, was <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and the stopping, and preventing of destruction. The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> feared the blood; for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of what it was a Type; he shuddered, thinking on the Lord's death; therefore he did not touch the door-posts.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, Smear, and they smeared, and were confident. And you, having the Blood of the Lamb Himself, are you not confident?</p>

<p>2. <q>By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they passed through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> as by dry land.</q> Again he compares one whole people with another, lest they should say, we cannot be as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<p><q>By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q> (he says) <q>they passed through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>, as by dry land, which the Egyptians assaying to do, were drowned.</q> Here he leads them also to a recollection of the sufferings in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</p>

<p>How, <q>by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q>? Because they had hoped to pass through the sea, and therefore they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>: or rather it was <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. Do you see that everywhere Faith goes beyond <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasonings, and weakness and lowliness? Do you see that at the same time they both <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and feared punishment, both in the blood on the doors, and in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>?</p>

<p>And he made it clear that it was [really] water, through those that fell into it, and were choked; that it was not a mere appearance: but as in the case of the lions those who were devoured <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the reality of the facts, and in the case of the fiery furnace, those who were burnt; so here also you see that the same things become to the one a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>  and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and to the other of destruction.</p>

<p>So great a good is Faith. And when we fall into perplexity, then are we delivered, even though we come to death itself, even though our condition be desperate. For what else was left [for them]? They were unarmed, compassed about by the Egyptians and the sea; and they must either be drowned if they fled, or fall into the hands of the Egyptians. But nevertheless [He] saved them from impossibilities. That which was spread under the one as land, overwhelmed the others as sea. In the former case it forgot its nature: in the latter it even armed itself against them. <span class="stiki">cf. <a href="../bible/wis019.htm#verse20">Wisdom 19:20</a></span></p>

<p>3. <q>By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the walls of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> fell down, after they had been compassed about for seven days.</q> For assuredly the sound of trumpets is not able to throw down stones, though one blow for ten thousand years; but Faith can do all things.</p>

<p>Do you see that in all cases it is not by natural sequence, nor yet by any law of nature that it was changed, but all is done contrary to expectation? Accordingly in this case also all is done contrary to expectation. For inasmuch as he had said again and again, that we ought to trust to the future hopes, he introduced all this argument with reason, showing that not now [only], but even from the beginning all the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> have been accomplished and achieved by means of it.</p>

<p><q>By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the harlot Rahab perished not with  them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, having received the spies with peace.</q> It would then be disgraceful, if you should appear more faithless even than a harlot. Yet she [merely] heard what the men related, and immediately <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Whereupon the end also followed; for when all perished, she alone was preserved. She did not say to herself, I shall be with my many friends.  She did not say, Can I possibly be wiser than these judicious men who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>&mdash;and shall I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? She said no such thing, but <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> what had taken place,  which it was likely that they would suffer.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 11:32</h2>

<p>4. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse32">Hebrews 11:32</a></span> <q>And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell.</q> After this he no longer puts down the names: but having ended with an harlot, and put them to shame by the quality of the person, he no longer enlarges on the histories, lest he should be thought tedious. However he does not set them aside, but runs over them, [doing] both very judiciously, avoiding satiety, and not spoiling the closeness of arrangement; he was neither altogether silent, nor did he speak so as to annoy; for he effects both points. For when a man is contending vehemently [in argument], if he persist in contending, he wearies out the hearer, annoying him when he is already persuaded, and gaining the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of vain ambitiousness. For he ought to accommodate himself to what is expedient.</p>

<p><q>And what do I more say</q> (he says)? <q>For the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthah, of David also and Samuel, and of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q></p>

<p>Some find fault with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, because he puts Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah in these places. What do you say? After having introduced the harlot, shall he not introduce these? For do not tell me of the rest of their life, but only whether they did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and shine in Faith.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 11:33</h2>

<p><q>And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q> he says, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse33">Hebrews 11:33</a></span> <q>who through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> subdued kingdoms.</q> You see that he does not here testify to their life as being illustrious; for this was not the point in question: but the enquiry thus far was about their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For tell me whether they did not accomplish all by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?</p>

<p><q>By <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> he says, <q>they subdued kingdoms;</q> those with Gideon. <q>Wrought righteousness;</q> who? The same. Plainly he means here, kindness. </p>

<p>I think it is of David that he says <q>they obtained promises.</q> But of what sort were these? Those in which He said that his <q>seed should sit upon</q> his <q>throne.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa131.htm#verse12">Psalm 132:12</a></span></p>

<h2>Hebrews 11:34</h2>

<p><q>Stopped the mouths of lions,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse34">Hebrews 11:34</a></span> <q>quenched the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of fire, escaped the edge of the sword.</q> See how they were in death itself, Daniel encompassed by the lions, the three children abiding in the furnace, the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>,  <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, Jacob, in various <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>; and yet not even so did they despair. For this is Faith; when things are turning out adversely, then we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that nothing adverse is done, but all things in due order.</p>

<p><q>Escaped the edge of the sword.</q> I think that he is again speaking of the three children.</p>

<p><q>Out of  weakness were made strong.</q> Here he alludes to what took place at their return from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. For <q>out of weakness,</q> is out of captivity. When the condition of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had now become desperate, when they were no better than dead bones, who could have expected that they would return from <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and not return only; but also <q>wax valiant</q> and <q>turn to flight armies of aliens</q>? 'But to us,' some one says,  'no such thing has happened.' But these are figures of <q>the things to come.</q></p>

<h2>Hebrews 11:35</h2>

<p><q>Women received their dead raised to life again.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse35">Hebrews 11:35</a></span> He here speaks of what occurred in regard to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, Elisha, [and] Elijah; for they raised the dead.</p>

<p>5. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse35">Hebrews 11:35</a></span> <q>And others were tortured,  not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.</q> But we have not obtained a Resurrection. I am able however, he means, to show that they also were cut off, and did <q>not accept [deliverance], that they might obtain a better resurrection.</q> For why, tell me, when it was open to them to live, did they not choose it? Were they not evidently looking for a better life? And they who had raised up others, themselves chose to die; in order <q>to obtain a better resurrection,</q> not such as the children of those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. </p>

<p>Here I think he alludes both to John and to James. For beheading is called <q>torturing.</q>  It was in their power still to behold the sun. It was in their power to abstain from reproving  [sinners], and yet they chose to die; even they who had raised others chose to die themselves, <q>that they might obtain a better resurrection.</q></p>

<h2>Hebrews 11:36</h2>

<p> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse36">Hebrews 11:36</a></span> <q>And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment.</q> He ends with these; with things that come nearer home. For these [ex  amples] especially bring consolation, when the distress is from the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, since even if you mention something more extreme, yet unless it arise from the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, you have effected nothing. Therefore he concluded his discourse with this, mentioning <q>bonds, imprisonments, scourges, <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stonings</a>,</q> alluding to the case of Stephen, also to that of Zacharias.</p>

<p>Wherefore he added, <q>They were slain with the sword.</q> What do you say? Some <q>escaped the edge of the sword,</q> and some <q>were slain by the sword.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse34">Hebrews 11:34</a></span> What is this? Which do you praise? Which do you admire? The latter or the former? Nay, he says: the former indeed, is appropriate to you, and the latter, because Faith was strong even unto death itself, and it is a type of things to come. For the wonderful qualities of Faith are two, that it both accomplishes great things, and suffers great things, and counts itself to suffer nothing.</p>

<p>And you can not say (he says) that these were sinners and worthless. For even if you put the whole world against them, I find that they weigh down the beam and are of greater value.  What then were they to receive in this life? Here he raises up their thoughts, teaching them not to be riveted to things present, but to mind  things greater than all that are in this present life, since the <q>world is not worthy</q> of them. What then do you wish to receive here? For it were an insult to you, should you receive your reward here.</p>

<p>6. Let us not then mind  worldly things, nor seek our recompense here, nor be so beggarly. For if <q>the</q> whole <q>world is not worthy of</q> them, why do you seek after a part of it? And with good reason; for they are friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Now by <q>the world</q> does he mean here the people, or the creation itself? Both: for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> is wont to use the word of both. If the whole creation, he would say, with the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings that belong to it, were put in the balance, they yet would not be of equal value with these; and with reason. For as ten thousand measures of chaff and hay would not be of equal value to ten pearls, so neither they; for <q>better is one that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, than ten thousand transgressors</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir016.htm#verse3">Sirach 16:3</a></span>;  meaning by <q>ten thousand</q> not [merely] many, but an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> multitude.</p>

<p>Consider of how great value is the righteous man. Joshua the son of Nun said, <q>Let the sun stand still at Gibeon, the moon at the valley of Elom</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse12">Joshua 10:12</a></span>, and it was so. Let then the whole world come, or rather two or three, or four, or ten, or twenty worlds, and let them say and do this; yet shall they not be able. But the friend of God commanded the creatures of his Friend, or rather he besought his Friend, and the servants yielded, and he below gave command to those above. Do you see that these things are for service fulfilling their appointed course?</p>

<p>This was greater than the [<a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>] of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Why (I ask)? Because it is not a like thing to command the sea and the heavenly [bodies]. For that indeed was also a great thing, yea very great, nevertheless it was not at all equal [to the other].</p>

<p>Why was this? The name of Joshua [Jesus],  was a type. For this reason then, and because of the very name, the creation reverenced him. What then! Was no other person called Jesus? [Yes]; but this man was on this account so called in type; for he used to be called Hoshea. Therefore the name was changed: for it was a prediction and a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. He brought in the people into the promised land, as Jesus [does] into heaven; not the Law; since neither did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> [bring them in], but remained without. The Law has not power to bring in, but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Do you see the types which have been before sketched out from the beginning? He laid his commands on the creation, or rather, on the chief  part of the creation, on the very head itself as he stood below; that so when you see Jesus in the form of Man saying the same, you may not be disturbed, nor think it strange. He, even while <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was living, turned back <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Thus, even while the Law is living, He directs  all things; but not openly.</p>

<p>7. But let us consider how great is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. If <em>here</em> they work such things, if <em>here</em> they do such things, as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do, what then above? How great is the splendor they have?</p>

<p>Perhaps each of you might wish to be such as to be able to command the sun and moon. (At this point what would they say who assert that the heaven is a sphere?  For why did he not [merely] say, <q>Let the sun stand still,</q> but added <q>Let the sun stand still at the valley of Elom,</q> that is, he will make the day longer? This was done also in the time of Hezekiah. The sun went back. This again is more wonderful than the other, to go the contrary way, not having yet gone round his course.)</p>

<p>We shall attain to greater things than these if we will. For what has Christ promised us? Not that we shall make the sun stand still, or the moon, nor that the sun shall retrace his steps, but what? <q>I and the Father will come unto him,</q> He says, <q>and We will make our abode with him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John 14:23</a></span> What need have I  of the sun and the moon, and of these wonders, when the Lord of all Himself comes down and abides with me? I need these not. For what need I any of these things? He Himself shall be to me for Sun and for Light. For, tell me, if you had entered into a palace, which would you choose, to be able to rearrange some of the things which have been fixed there, or so to make the king a familiar friend, as to persuade him to take up his abode with you? Much rather the latter than the former.</p>

<p>8. But what wonder is it, says some one, that what a man commands, Christ should also? But Christ (you say) needs not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but acts of His own authority, you say. Well. Therefore first confess and say, that he needs not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and acts of His own authority: and then I will ask you, whether His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not in the way of condescension and arrangement (for surely Christ was not inferior to Joshua the son of Nun), and that He might teach us? For as when you hear a teacher lisping,  and saying over the alphabet, thou dost not say that he is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; and when he asks, Where is such a letter? You know that he does not ask in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, but because he wishes to lead on the scholar; in like manner Christ also did not make His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> as needing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but desiring to lead you on, that you may continually apply yourself to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that you may do it without ceasing, soberly, and with great watchfulness.</p>

<p>And by watching, I do not mean, merely the rising at night, but also the being sober  in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> during the day. For such an one is called watchful.  Since it is possible both in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> by night to be asleep, and in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> by day to be awake, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is stretched out towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when it considers with whom it holds converse, to whom its words are addressed, when it has in mind that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> stand by with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling, while he approaches gaping and scratching himself.</p>

<p>9. Prayer is a mighty weapon if it be made with suitable mind. And that you may learn its strength, continued entreaty has overcome shamelessness, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and savage cruelty, and overbearing rashness. For He says, <q>Hear what the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge says.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse6">Luke 18:6</a></span> Again it has overcome sloth also, and what friendship did not effect, this continued entreaty did: and <q>although he will not give him because he is his friend</q> (He says), <q>yet because of his importunity he will rise and give to him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse8">Luke 11:8</a></span> &nbsp;And continued assiduity made her worthy who was unworthy. <q>It is not meet</q> (He says) <q>to take the children's bread and to cast it to the dogs. Yea! Lord!</q> she says, <q>for even the dogs eat [the crumbs] from their master's table.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse26">Matthew 15:26-27</a></span> Let us apply ourselves to Prayer. It is a mighty weapon if it be offered with earnestness, if without vainglory, if with a sincere mind. It has turned back <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, it has benefited an entire nation though undeserving. <q>I have heard their groaning</q> (He says) <q>and have come down to deliver them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse34">Acts 7:34</a></span> It is itself a saving medicine, and has power to prevent <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to heal misdeeds. In this the desolate <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> was assiduous. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse5">1 Timothy 5:5</a></span></p>

<p>If then we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with humility, smiting our breast as the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, if we utter what he did, if we say, <q>Be merciful to me a sinner</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse13">Luke 18:13</a></span>, we shall obtain all. For though we be not <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, yet have we other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not less than his.</p>

<p>For do not tell me, that you have gone wrong in some small matter [only], since the thing has the same nature. For as a man is equally called a homicide whether he has killed a child or a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so also is he called overreaching whether he be overreaching in much or in little. Yea and to remember injuries too, is no small matter, but even a great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is said, <q>the ways of those who remember injuries [tend] to death.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro012.htm#verse28">Proverbs 12:28</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> And <q>He that is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, shall be in danger of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,</q> and he that <q>calls his brother a fool</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a></span>, and senseless, and numberless such things.</p>

<p>But we partake even of the tremendous <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> unworthily, and we <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and we revile. And some of us have even oftentimes been drunk. But each one of these things, even itself by itself, is enough to cast us out of the kingdom, and when they even come all together, what comfort shall we have? We need much penitence, beloved, much <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, much endurance, much perseverance, that we may be enabled to attain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which have been promised to us.</p>

<p>10. Let us then say, even we, <q>Be merciful to me a sinner,</q> nay rather, let us not say it only, but let us also be thus minded; and should another call us so, let us not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. He heard the words, <q>I am not as this Publican</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse11">Luke 18:11</a></span>, and was not provoked thereby, but filled with compunction. He accepted the reproach, and he put away the reproach. The other spoke of the wound, and he sought the medicine. Let us say then, <q>Be merciful to me a sinner</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse13">Luke 18:13</a></span>; but even if another should so call us, let us not be indignant.</p>

<p>But if we say ten thousand <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things of ourselves, and are vexed when we hear them from others, then there is no longer humility, nor confession, but ostentation and vainglory. Is it ostentation (you say) to call one's self a sinner? Yes; for we obtain the credit of humility,  we are admired, we are commended; whereas if we say the contrary of ourselves, we are despised. So that we do this too for the sake of credit. But what is humility? It is when another reviles us, to bear it, to acknowledge our fault, to endure <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speakings. And yet even this would not be [a mark] of humility but of candor. But now we call ourselves sinners, unworthy, and ten thousand other such names, but if another apply one of them to us, we are vexed, we become savage. Do you see that this is not confession, nor even candor? You said of yourself that you are such an one: be not indignant if you hear it also said by others, and art reproved.</p>

<p>In this way your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are made lighter for you, when others reproach you: for they lay a burden on themselves indeed, but you they lead onwards into <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Hear what the blessed David says, when Shimei cursed him, <q>Let him alone</q> (he says) <q>the Lord has bidden him, that He might look on my humiliation</q> (he says): <q>And the Lord will requite me good for his cursing on this day.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2sa016.htm#verse11">2 Samuel 16:11-12</a></span></p>

<p>But thou while saying <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things of yourself, even in excess, if you hear not from others the commendations that are due to the most righteous, art enraged. Do you see that you are trifling with things that are no subjects for trifling? For we even repudiate praises in our desire for other praises, that we may obtain yet higher panegyrics, that we may be more admired. So that when we decline to accept commendations, we do it that we may augment them. And all things are done by us for credit, not for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore all things are hollow, all impracticable. Wherefore I beseech you now at any rate to withdraw from this mother of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, vainglory, and to live according to what is approved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that so you may attain to the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, with whom to the Father be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, together with His Holy and good Spirit, now and ever and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
