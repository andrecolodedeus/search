<h1>Homily 27 on Romans</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse25">Rom. XIV. 25-27</a></p>

<p><q> <em>Now to Him that is of power to establish you according to my <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> according to the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest, and (manuscripts</em> <em><span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;</span> which Sav. omits) by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the Prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all nations for the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: to God only wise, to Him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</em></q> </p>

<p>It is always a custom with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to conclude his exhortation with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and doxologies. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the thing is one of no slight importance. And it is out of affectionateness and caution that he is in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of doing this. For it is the character of a teacher devoted to his children, and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not to instruct them in words only, but by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> too to bring upon his teaching the assistance which is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this he does here also. But the connection is as follows: <q>To Him that is of power to establish you, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> For he again clings to those weak brethren, and to them he directs his discourse. For when he was rebuking, he made all share his rebuke; but now, when he is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, it is for these that he wears the attitude of a suppliant. And after saying, <q>to establish,</q> he proceeds to give the mode of it, <q>according to my <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>;</q> and this was what one would do to show that as yet they were not firmly fixed, but stood, though with wavering. Then to give a trustworthiness to what he says, he proceeds, <q>and the preaching of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>;</q> that is, which He Himself preached. But if He preached it, the doctrines are not ours, but the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are of Him. And afterwards, in discussing the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the preaching, He shows that this gift is one of much benefit, and of much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; and this he first proves from the person of the declarer thereof, and then likewise from the things declared. For it was glad tidings. Besides, from His not having made anything of them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to any before us. And this he intimates in the words, <q>according to the revelation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.</q> And this is a sign of the greatest friendliness, to make us share in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and no one before us. <q>Which was kept secret since the world began, but now is made manifest.</q> For it had been determined long ago, but was only manifested now. How was it made manifest? <q>By the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of the Prophets.</q> Here again he is releasing the weak person from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For what do you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? Is it lest  thou depart from the Law? This the Law wishes, this it foretold from of old. But if you pry into the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of its being made manifest now, you are doing a thing not safe to do, in being curious about the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and calling Him to account. For we ought not with things of this nature to act as busybodies, but to be well pleased and content with them. Wherefore that he might himself put a check upon a spirit of this sort, he adds, <q>according to the commandment of the everlasting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> requires <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and not curiosity. And when God commands, one ought to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, not curious. Then he uses another argument to encourage them, saying <q>made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all nations.</q> That is, it is not thou alone but the whole world that is of this Creed, as having had not man, but God for a Teacher. Wherefore also he adds, <q>through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> But it was not only made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, but also confirmed. Now both are His work. And on this ground too the way it is to be read is,  <q>Now to Him that is of power to establish you through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>;</q> and, as I was saying, he ascribes them both to Him; or rather, not both of these only, but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> belonging (or ascribed, Gr. <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2;</span>) to the Father also. And this too is why he said, <q>to Whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> forever, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> And he uses a doxology again through awe at the incomprehensibleness of these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. For even now they have appeared, there is no such thing as comprehending them by reasonings, but it is by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we must come to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them, for in no other way can we. He well says, <q>To the only wise God.</q> For if you will only reflect how He brought the nations in, and blended them with those who in olden time had wrought well, how He saved those who were desperate, how He brought men not worthy of the earth up to heaven, and brought those who had fallen from the present life into that undying and unalterable life, and made those who were trampled down by devils to vie with Angels, and opened Paradise, and put a stop to all the old <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and this too in a short time and by an easy and compendious way, then will you learn His wisdom&mdash;when you see that which neither Angels nor Archangels <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, they of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> learned on a sudden through Jesus. (2 manuscripts add <q>then will you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His power.</q>) Right then is it to admire His wisdom, and to give Him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>! But you keep dwelling over little things, still sitting under the shadow. And this is not much like one that gives <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For he who has no confidence in Him, and no trust in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, does not bear testimony to the grandeur of His doings. But he himself offers <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> up in their behalf, in order to bring them also to the same <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. But when you hear him say, <q>to the only wise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> think not that this is said in disparagement of the Son. For if all these things whereby His wisdom is made apparent were done <span class="stiki">or made, see <a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John 1:3</a></span> by Christ, and without Him no single one, it is quite plain that he is equal in wisdom also. What then is the reason of his saying <q>only?</q> To set Him in contrast with every created being. After giving the doxology  then, he again goes from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to exhortation, directing his discourse against the stronger, and saying as follows:</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse1">Chap. xv. ver. 1</a>. <q>We then that are strong, ought</q>&mdash; it is <q>we ought,</q> not <q>we are so kind as to.</q> What is it we ought to do?&mdash; <q>to bear the infirmities of the weak.</q></p>

<p>See how he has roused their attention by his praises, not only by calling them powerful, but also by putting them alongside of himself. And not by this only, but by the advantage of the thing he again allures them, and by its not being burdensome. For thou, he says, art powerful, and art no whit the worse for condescending. But to him the hazard is of the last consequence, if he is not borne with. And he does not say the infirm, but the <q>infirmities of the weak,</q> so drawing him and bending him to mercy. As in another place too he says, <q>You that are spiritual restore such an one.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse1">Galatians 6:1</a></span> Are you become powerful? Render a return to God for making you so. But render it you will if you set the weakness of the sickly right. For we too were weak, but by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we have become powerful. And this we are to do not in this case only, but also in the case of those who are weak in other respects. As, for instance, if any be passionate, or insolent, or has any such like failing bear with him. And how is this to be? Listen to what comes next. For after saying <q>we ought to bear,</q> he adds, <q>and not to please ourselves.</q> </p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse2">Ver. 2</a>. <q>Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification.</q></p>

<p>But what he says is this. Are you powerful? Let the weak have trial of your power. Let him come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your strength; please him. And he does not barely say please, but for his good, and not barely for his good, lest the advanced person should say, See I am drawing him to his good! But he adds, <q>to edification.</q> And so if you be rich or be in power, please not yourself, but the poor and the needy, because in this way you will at once have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to enjoy, and be doing much service. For <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from things of the world soon flies away, but that from things of the Spirit is abiding, if you do it to edification. Wherefore of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> he requires this. For it is not this and that person that is to do it, but <q>each of you.</q> Then since it was a great thing he had commanded them, and had bidden them even relax their own perfectness in order to set right the other's weakness; he again introduces Christ, in the following words:</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse3">Ver. 3</a>. <q>For even Christ pleased not Himself.</q></p>

<p>And this he always does. For when he was upon the subject of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, he brought Him forward and said, <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord, that though He was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 8:9</a></span> And when he was exhorting to charity, it was from Him that he exhorted in the words <q>As Christ also loved us.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians 5:25</a></span> And when he was giving advice about bearing shame and dangers, he took refuge in Him and said, <q>Who for the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that was set before Him endured the Cross, despising the shame.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse2">Hebrews 12:2</a></span>. So in this passage too he shows how He also did this, and how the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> proclaimed it from of old. Wherefore also he proceeds:</p>

<p><q>The reproaches of them that reproached You fell upon Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa068.htm#verse9">Psalm 69:9</a></span> But what is the import of, <q>He pleased not Himself?</q> He had power not to have been reproached, power not to have suffered what He did suffer, had He been minded to look to His own things. But yet He was not so minded. But through looking to our good He neglected His own. And why did he not say, <q>He emptied Himself?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a></span> It is because this was not the only thing he wished to point out, that He became man, but that He was also ill-treated, and obtained a bad <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> with many, being looked upon as weak. For it says, <q>If Thou be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, come down from the Cross.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse40">Matthew 27:40</a></span>. And, <q>He saved others, Himself He cannot save.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse42">Matthew 27:42</a></span>. Hence he mentions a circumstance which was available for his present subject, and proves much more than he undertook to do; for he shows that it was not Christ alone that was reproached, but the Father also. <q>For the reproaches of them that reproached You fell,</q> he says, <q>upon Me.</q> But what he says is nearly this, What has happened is no new or strange thing. For they in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> who came to have a habit of reproaching Him, they also raved against His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. But these things were written that we should not imitate them. And then he supplies (Gr. anoints) them for a patient endurance of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse4">Ver. 4</a>. <q>For whatsoever things were written aforetime,</q> he says, <q>were written for our learning, that we, through patience and comfort of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, might have hope.</q></p>

<p>That is, that we might not fall away, (for there are sundry conflicts within and without), that being nerved and comforted by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, we might exhibit patience, that by living in patience we might abide in hope. For these things are productive of each other, patience of hope, and hope of patience. And both of them are brought about by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. Then he again brings his discourse into the form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and says,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse5">Ver. 5</a>. <q>Now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one towards another, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q></p>

<p>For since he had given his own advice, and had also urged the example of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he added the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> also, to show that with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> Himself gives patience also. And this is why he said, <q>Now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of patience and consolation grant you to be like-minded one towards another, according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> For this is what <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> would do, be minded toward another even as toward himself. Then to show again that it is not mere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that he requires, he adds, <q>according to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> And this he does, in all places, because there is also another sort of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And what is the advantage of their agreeing?</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse6">Ver. 6</a>. <q>That ye may with one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> he says, <q>and one mouth, glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>He does not say merely with one mouth, but bids us do it with one will also. See how he has united the whole body into one, and how he concludes his address again with a doxology, whereby he gives the utmost inducement to unanimity and concord. Then again from this point he keeps to the same exhortation as before, and says,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse7">Ver. 7</a>. <q>Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us, to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>The example again is as before, and the gain unspeakable. For this is a thing that does God special <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, the being closely united. And so if even against your will (Field <q>being grieved for His sake,</q> after Savile, but against manuscripts) and for His sake, thou be at variance with your brother, consider that by putting an end to your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> you are glorifying your Master, and if not on your brother's account, for this at all events be reconciled to him: or rather for this first. For Christ also insists upon this upon all possible grounds,  and when addressing His Father he said, <q>By this shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You have sent Me, if they be one.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse21">John 17:21</a></span></p>

<p>Let us <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> then, and knit ourselves to one another. For in this place it is not any longer the weak, but all that he is rousing. And were a man minded to break with you, do not thou break also. Nor give utterance to that cold saying, <q>Him I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that loves me; if my right eye does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me, I tear it out.</q> For these are satanical sayings, and fit for <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, and the little spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. But thou that art called to a greater citizenship, and are enrolled in the books of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, art liable to greater <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Do not speak in this way, but when he is not minded to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, then display the more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that you may draw him to you. For he is a member; and when by any force a member is sundered from the body, we do everything to unite it again, and then pay more attention to it. For the reward is the greater then, when one draws to one a person not minded to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For if He bids us invite to supper those that cannot make us any recompense, that what goes for recompense may be the greater, much more ought we to do this in regard to friendship. Now he that is loved and loves, does pay you a recompense. But he that is loved and loves not, has made God a debtor to you in his own room. And besides, when he loves you he needs not much pains; but when he loves you not, then he stands in need of your assistance. Make not then the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for painstaking a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for listlessness; and say not, because he is sick, that is the reason I take no care of him (for a sickness indeed the dulling of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is), but do thou warm again that which has become chilled. But suppose he will not be warmed, <q>what then?</q> is the reply. Continue to do your own part. <q>What if he grow more perverse?</q> He is but procuring to you so much greater return, and shows you so much the greater imitator of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if the loving one another was to be the characteristic of <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> (<q>For hereby,</q> He says, <q>shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are My <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another</q>), <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse35">John 13:35</a></span> consider how great an one loving one that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> us must be. For your Master loved those that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Him, and called them to Him; and the weaker they were, the greater the care He showed them; and He cried and said, <q>They that are whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew 9:12</a></span> And He deemed <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners worthy of the same table with Him. And as great as was the dishonor wherewith the Jewish people treated Him, so great was the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and concern He showed for them, yea, and much greater. Him do thou also emulate: for this good work is no light one, but one without which not even he that is a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> can please God much, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says.  Say not then, I get <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, and that is why I do not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For this is why you ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> most. And besides, it is not in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things for a man who loves to be soon <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, but brute as a person may be, he loves them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him. For this He says the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> do. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse46">Matthew 5:46</a></span> But if every one loves those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, who is there that would not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> while they are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>? Display then this conduct, and cease not to use this word, <q>Hate me as much as you may, I will not leave off loving you,</q> and then you will <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> his quarrelsomeness, and cast out all coldness.  For this disorder comes either from excessive heat (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03B3;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x1F25;&#x03C2;</span>, inflammation), or from coldness; but both of these is the might of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wont to correct by its warmth. Did you never see those who indulge a base <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> beaten, spit upon, called names, ill-treated in a thousand ways by those fornicatresses? What then? Do the insults break off this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? In no wise: they even kindle it the more. And yet they who do these things, besides being harlots, are of a disreputable and low grade. But they who submit to it, have often illustrious ancestors to count up, and much other nobility to boast of. Yet still none of these things break the tie, nor keep them aloof from her whom they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And are we not ashamed then to find what great power the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> (v. p. 520) and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> has, and not to be able to display as much in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> according to God? Do you not perceive that this is a very great weapon against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? Do you not see, that that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> stands by, dragging to himself the man you hate, and desiring to snatch away the member? And do you run by, and give up the prize of the conflict? For your brother, lying between you, is the prize. And if you get the better, you receive a crown; but if you are listless, you go away without a crown. Cease then to give utterance to that satanical saying, <q>if my eye <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> me, I cannot see it.</q>  For nothing is more shameful than this saying, and yet the generality lay it down for a sign of a noble spirit. But nothing is more ignoble than all this, nothing more senseless, nothing more foolish.  Therefore I am indeed quite grieved that the doings of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> are held to be those of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that looking down on men, and despising them, should seem to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> and dignified. And this is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> greatest snare, to invest iniquity with a good repute, whereby it becomes hard to blot out. For I have often heard men taking credit to themselves at their not going near those who are averse to them. And yet your Master found a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in this. How often do not men despise (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x1F73;&#x03C0;&#x03C4;&#x03C5;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>) Him? How often show aversion to Him? Yet He ceases not to run unto them. Say not then that <q>I cannot bear to come near those that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> me,</q> but say, that <q>I cannot bear to despise (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03C0;&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) those that despise me.</q> This is the language of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, as the other is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a>. This makes men <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, as the other does shameful and ridiculous. It is on this ground we feel admiration for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, because even when God said, <q>Let Me alone, that I may destroy them in Mine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse10">Exodus 32:10</a></span> he could not bear to despise those who had so often shown aversion to him, but said, <q>If you will forgive them their trespass, forgive it; else blot out me also.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse32">Exodus 32:32</a></span> This was owing to his being a friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a copyer of Him. And let us not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> ourselves in things for which we ought to hide our faces. Nor let us use the language of these lewd fellows, that are the scum of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to scorn (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C0;&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>, spit at) thousands. But even if another use it, let us laugh him down, and stop his mouth for taking a delight in what he ought to feel ashamed of. What say you, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, do you scorn a man that believes, whom when unbelieving Christ scorned not? Why do I say scorned not? Why He had such <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards him, when he was vile and unsightly, as even to die for him. He then so loved, and that such a person, and do you now, when he has been made fair and admirable, scorn him; now he is made a member of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and has been made your Master's body? Do you not consider what you are uttering, nor perceive what you are venturing to do? He has Christ as a Head, and a Table, and a Garment, and Life, and Light, and a Bridegroom, and He is everything to him, and do you dare to say, <q>this fellow I despise?</q> and not this only, but thousands of others along with him? Stay you, O man, and cease from your <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; get to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your brother. Learn that these be words of unreasonableness, and frenzy, and say on the contrary, though he despise me ten thousand times, yet will I never stand aloof from him. In this way you will both gain your brother, and wilt live to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wilt share the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come. To which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant that we may all attain, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward man, etc.</p>
