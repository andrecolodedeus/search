<h1>Homily 28 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 3:17</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>For God sent not His Son  to condemn the world, but to save the world.</q> </div>

<p>1. Many of the more careless sort of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, using the lovingkindness of God to increase the magnitude of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and the excess of their disregard, speak in this way, <q>There is no <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, there is no future punishment, God forgives us all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> To stop whose mouths a wise man says, <q>Say not, His mercy is great, He will be pacified for the multitude of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for mercy and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> come from Him, and His indignation rests upon sinners</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir005.htm#verse6">Sirach 5:6</a></span>: and again, <q>As His mercy is great, so is His correction also.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir016.htm#verse12">Sirach 16:12</a></span> <q>Where then,</q> says one, <q>is His lovingkindness, if we shall receive for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> according to our deserts?</q> That we shall indeed receive <q>according to our deserts,</q> hear both the Prophet and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declare; one says, <q>You shall render to every man according to his work</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa061.htm#verse12">Psalm 62:12</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span>; the other, <q>Who will render to every man according to his work.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse6">Romans 2:6</a></span> And yet we may see that even so the lovingkindness of God is great; in dividing our <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>  into two periods,  the present life and that which is to come, and making the first to be an appointment of trial, the second a place of crowning, even in this He has shown great lovingkindness.</p>

<p><q>How and in what way?</q> Because when we had committed many and grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and had not ceased from youth to extreme old age to defile our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with ten thousand <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, for none of these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> did He demand from us a reckoning, but granted us remission of them by the washing  of Regeneration, and freely gave us Righteousness and Sanctification. <q>What then,</q> says one, <q>if a man who from his earliest age has been deemed worthy of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, after this commits ten thousand <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?</q> Such an one deserves a severer punishment. For we do not pay the same penalties for the same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if we do wrong after Initiation.  And this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares, saying, <q>He that despised <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> law died without mercy under two or three witnesses; of how much sorer punishment, do you suppose, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and has counted the blood of the Covenant an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> thing, and has done despite unto the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse28">Hebrews 10:28-29</a></span> Such an one then is worthy of severer punishment.  Yet even for him God has opened doors of repentance, and has granted him many means for the washing away his transgressions, if he will. Think then what <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of lovingkindness these are; by Grace to remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and not to punish him who after <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and deserves punishment, but to give him a season and appointed space for his clearing.  For all these reasons Christ said to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sent not His Son to condemn the world, but to save the world.</q></p>

<p>For there are two Advents of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that which has been, and that which is to be; and the two are not for the same purpose; the first came to pass not that He might search into our actions, but that He might remit; the object of the second will be not to remit, but to enquire. Therefore of the first He says, <q>I came not to condemn the world, but to save the world</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse17">John 3:17</a></span>; but of the second, <q>When the  Son shall have come in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His Father,  He shall set the sheep on His right hand, and the goats on His left.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse31">Matthew 25:31, 46</a></span> And they shall go, these into life; and these into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment. Yet His former coming was for judgment, according to the rule of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Why? Because before His coming there was a law of nature, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and moreover a written Law, and doctrine, and ten thousand promises, and manifestations of signs, and chastisements, and vengeances, and many other things which might have set men right, and it followed that for all these things He would demand account; but, because He is merciful, He for a while pardons instead of making enquiry. For had He done so, all would at once have been hurried to perdition. For <q>all,</q> it says, <q>have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and come short of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse23">Romans 3:23</a></span> Do you see the unspeakable excess of His lovingkindness?</p>

<h2>John 3:18</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>He that believes in the Son,  is not judged;  but he that believes not, is judged already.</q></div>

<p>Yet if He <q>came not to judge the world,</q> how is <q>he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not judged already,</q> if the time of <q>judgment</q> has not yet arrived? He either means this, that the very fact of disbelieving without repentance is a punishment, (for to be without the light, contains in itself a very severe punishment,) or he announces beforehand what shall be. For as the murderer, though he be not as yet condemned by the decision of the judge, is still condemned by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing, so is it with the unbeliever. Since <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> also died on the day that he ate of the tree; for so ran the decree, <q>In the day that you eat of the tree, you shall die</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse17">Genesis 2:17</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span>; yet he lived. How then <q>died</q> he? By the decree; by the very nature of the thing; for he who has rendered himself liable to punishment, is under its penalty, and if for a while not actually so, yet he is by the sentence.</p>

<p>Lest any one on hearing, <q>I came not to judge the world,</q> should <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that he might <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unpunished, and should so become more careless, Christ stops  such disregard by saying, <q>is judged already</q>; and because the <q>judgment</q> was future and not yet at hand, He brings near the dread of vengeance, and describes the punishment as already come. And this is itself a mark of great lovingkindness, that He not only gives His Son, but even delays the time of judgment, that they who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, may have power to wash away their transgressions.</p>

<p><q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is not judged.</q> He that <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>,</q> not he that is over-curious: he that <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>,</q> not the busybody. But what if his life be unclean, and his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? It is of such as these especially that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares, that they are not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> at all: <q>They profess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in works they deny Him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse16">Titus 1:16</a></span> But here Christ says, that such an one is not <q>judged</q> in this one particular; for his works indeed he shall suffer a severer punishment, but having <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> once, he is not chastised for unbelief.</p>

<p>2. Do you see how having commenced His discourse with fearful things, He has concluded it again with the very same? For at first He says, <q>Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God</q>: and here again, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not on the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is judged already.</q> <q>Think not,</q> He says, <q>that the delay advantages at all the guilty, except he repent, for he that has not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, shall be in no better state than those who are already condemned and under punishment.</q></p>

<h2>John 3:19</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light.</q></div>

<p>What He says, is of this kind: <q>they are punished, because they would not leave the darkness, and hasten to the light.</q> And hence He goes on to deprive them of all excuse for the future: <q>Had I come,</q> says He, <q>to punish and to exact account of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, they might have been able to say, 'this is why we started away from you,' but now I have come to free them from darkness, and to bring them to the light; who then could pity one who will not come from darkness unto light? When they have no charge to bring against us, but have received ten thousand benefits, they start away from us.</q> And this charge He has brought in another place, where He says, <q>They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse25">John 15:25</a></span>: and again, <q>If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John 15:22</a></span> For he who in the absence of light sits in darkness, may perchance receive pardon; but one who after it has come abides by the darkness, produces against himself a certain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a perverse and contentious disposition. Next, because His assertion would seem incredible to most, (for none would prefer <q>darkness to light,</q>) He adds the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of such a feeling in them. What is that?</p>

<h2>John 3:19-20</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Because their deeds were evil. For every one that does evil, hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</q></div>

<p>Yet he came not to judge or to enquire, but to pardon and remit transgressions, and to grant <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. How then fled they?   Had He come and sat in His Judgment seat, what He said might have seemed reasonable; for he that is conscious to himself of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, is wont to fly his judge. But, on the contrary, they who have transgressed even run to one who is pardoning. If therefore He came to pardon, those would naturally most hasten to Him who were conscious to themselves of many transgressions; and indeed this was the case with many, for even <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners sat at meat with Jesus. What then is this which He says? He says this of those who choose always to remain in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. He indeed came, that He might forgive men's former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and secure them against those to come; but since there are some so relaxed,  so powerless for the toils of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that they desire to abide by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> till their latest breath, and never cease from it, He speaks in this place reflecting  upon these. <q>For since,</q> He says, <q>the profession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> requires besides right doctrine a sound conversation also, they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to come over to us, because they like not to show forth a righteous life. Him that lives in <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> none would blame, because with gods such as he has, and with <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> as foul and ridiculous as his gods, he shows forth actions that suit his doctrines; but those who belong to the True <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if they live a careless life, have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to call them to account, and to accuse them. So greatly do even its enemies admire the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Observe, then, how exactly He lays down what He says. His expression is, not <q>He that has done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> comes not to the light,</q> but <q>he that does it always, he that desires always to roll himself in the mire of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he will not subject himself to My <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, but chooses to stay without, and to commit fornication without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and to do all other forbidden things. For if he comes to Me, he becomes manifest as a thief in the light, and therefore he avoids My dominion.</q> For instance, even now one may hear many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> say, <q>that they cannot come to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, because they cannot leave off <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and fornication, and the like disorders.</q></p>

<p><q>Well,</q> says some one, <q>but are there no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> that do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> that live discreetly?</q>  That there are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but whether there are <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> who live a righteous life, I do not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> assuredly. For do not speak to me of those who by nature are good and orderly, (this is not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>,) but tell me of the man who can endure the exceeding <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and (yet) be temperate.  You cannot. For if the promise of a Kingdom, and the threat of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and so much other provision,  can scarcely keep men in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, they will hardly go after <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in none of these things. Or, if any pretend to do so, they do it for show; and he who does so for show, will not, when he may escape observation, refrain from indulging his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires. However, that we may not seem to any to be contentious, let us grant that there are right livers among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; for neither does this go against my argument, since I spoke of that which occurs in general, not of what happens rarely.</p>

<p>And observe how in another way He deprives them of all excuse, when He says that, <q>the light came into the world.</q> <q>Did they seek it themselves,</q> He says, <q>did they toil, did they labor to find it? The light itself came to them, and not even so would they hasten to it.</q> And if there be some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who live wickedly, I would argue that He does not say this of those who have been <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the beginning, and who have inherited <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion from their forefathers, (although even these for the most part have been shaken from  right doctrine by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life,) yet still I think that He does not now speak concerning these, but concerning the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who ought to have come  to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>. For He shows that no man living in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> would choose to come to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> unless he before had planned  for himself a righteous life, and that none would remain in unbelief unless he had previously chosen always to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</p>

<p>Do not tell me that a man is temperate, and does not rob; these things by themselves are not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For what advantages it, if a man has these things, and yet is the slave of vainglory, and remains in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the company of his friends? This is not right living. The slave of a <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>  is no less a sinner than the fornicator; nay, he works more and more grievous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> than he. But tell me of any one that is free from all <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and from all iniquity, and who remains among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. You can not do so; for even those among them who have boasted great things, and who have, as they say,  mastered <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> or <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, have been, most of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the slaves of <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>,  and this is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Thus it is that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also have continued <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; for which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Christ rebuked them and said, <q>How can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, which receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from men?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse44">John 5:44</a></span></p>

<p><q>And why, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, did He not speak on these matters with Nathanael, to whom He testified of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, nor extend His discourse to any length?</q> Because even he came not with such <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> as did <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>. For <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> made  this his work,  and the season which others used for rest he made a season for hearing; but Nathanael came at the instance of another. Yet not even him did Jesus entirely pass by, for to him He says, <q>Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God ascending and descending upon the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse51">John 1:51</a></span> But to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> He spoke not so, but conversed with him on the Dispensation and on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, addressing each differently and suitably to the condition of his will. It was sufficient for Nathanael, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and was not so timid either, to hear only thus far; but because <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a> was as yet possessed by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, Christ did not indeed clearly reveal to him the whole, but shook his mind so as to cast out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, declaring that he who did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> was being judged,  and that unbelief proceeded from an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. For since he made great account of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from men, more than he did of the punishment; (<q>Many,</q> says the Evangelist, <q>of the rulers <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, but because of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> they did not confess</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse42">John 12:42</a></span>) on this point Christ touches him, saying, <q>It cannot be that he who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not on Me disbelieves for any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> save that he lives an unclean life.</q> Farther on He says, <q>I am the Light</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse12">John 8:12</a></span>, but here, <q>the Light came into the world</q>; for at the beginning He spoke somewhat darkly, but afterwards more clearly. Yet even so the man was kept back by regard for the opinion of the many, and therefore could not endure to speak boldly as he ought.</p>

<p>Fly we then vainglory, for this is a passion more tyrannical than any. Hence spring <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and love of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, hence <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and strifes; for he that desires more than he has, will never be able to stop, and he desires from no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but only from his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of vainglory. For tell me, why do so many encircle themselves with multitudes of eunuchs, and herds of slaves, and much show? Not because they need it, but that they may make those who meet them witnesses of this unseasonable display. If then we cut this off, we shall slay together with the head the other members also of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and there will be nothing to hinder us from dwelling on earth as though it were heaven. Nor does this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> merely thrust its captives into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but is even co-existent  with their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and when it is unable entirely to cast us out of these, it still causes us much damage in the very exercise of them, forcing us to undergo the toil, and depriving us of the fruit. For he that with an eye to this, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, and shows mercy, has his reward. What can be more pitiable than a loss like this, that it should befall man to bewail  himself uselessly and in vain, and to become an object of ridicule, and to lose the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from above? Since he that aims at both cannot obtain both. It is indeed possible to obtain both, when we desire not both, but one only, that from heaven; but he cannot obtain both, who longs for both. Wherefore if we wish to attain to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, let us flee from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and desire that only which comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so shall we obtain both the one and the other; which may we all enjoy, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and loving kindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
