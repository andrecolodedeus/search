<h1>Homily 29 on Hebrews</h1>

<h2>Hebrews 12:4-6</h2>

<p> <em><q>You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of Him. For whom the Lord loves, He chastens: and scourges every son whom He receives.</q></em> </p>

<p>1. There are two kinds of consolation, apparently opposed to one another, but yet contributing great strength each to the other; both of which he has here put forward. The one is when we say that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have suffered much: for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is refreshed, when it has many witnesses of its own sufferings, and this he introduced above, saying, <q>Call to mind the former days, in which after ye had been illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse32">Hebrews 10:32</a></span> The other is when we say, <q>You have suffered no great thing.</q> The former, when [the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>] has been exhausted refreshes it, and makes it recover breath: the latter, when it has become indolent and supine, turns it again  and pulls down <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Thus that no <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> may spring up in them from that testimony [to their sufferings], see what he does. <q>You have not yet</q> (he says) <q>resisted unto blood, [striving] against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> And he did not at once go on with what follows, but after having shown them all those who had stood <q>unto blood,</q> and then brought in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, His sufferings,  he afterwards easily pursued his discourse. This he says also in writing to the Corinthians, <q>There has no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> taken you, but such as is common to man</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 10:13</a></span>, that is, small. For this is enough to arouse and set right the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when it considers that it has not risen to the whole [trial], and encourages itself from what has already befallen it.</p>

<p>What he means is this: You have not yet submitted to death; your loss has extended to money, to <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, to being driven from place to place. Christ however shed His blood for you, while you have not [done it] for yourselves. He contended for the Truth even unto death fighting for you; while you have not yet entered upon dangers that threaten death.</p>

<p><q>And you have forgotten the exhortation.</q> That is, And you have slackened your hands, you have become faint. <q>You have not yet,</q> he said, <q>resisted unto blood, striving against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> Here he indicates that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is both very vigorous,  and is itself armed. For the [expression] <q>You have resisted [stood firm against],</q> is used with reference to those who stand firm. </p>

<p>2. <q>Which</q> (he says) <q>speaks unto you as unto sons, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of Him.</q> He has drawn his encouragement from the facts themselves; over and above he adds also that which is drawn from arguments, from this testimony.</p>

<p><q>Faint not</q> (he says) <q>when you are rebuked of Him.</q> It follows that these things are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For this too is no small matter of consolation, when we learn that it is God's work that such things have power,  He allowing [them]; even as also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says; <q>He said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you: for My strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2 Corinthians 12:9</a></span> He it is who allows [them].</p>

<p><q>For whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives.</q> You can not say that any righteous man is without affliction: even if he appear to be so, yet <em>we</em> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not his other afflictions. So that of necessity every righteous man must pass through affliction. For it is a declaration of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that the wide and broad way leads to destruction, but the strait and narrow one to life. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse13">Matthew 7:13-14</a></span> If then it is possible to enter into life by that means, and is not by any other, then all have entered in by the narrow [way], as many as have departed unto life.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 12:7</h2>

<p><q>You endure chastisement</q>  (he says); not for punishment, nor for vengeance, nor for suffering. See, from that from which they supposed they had been deserted [of God], from these he says they may be confident, that they have not been deserted. It is as if he had said, Because you have suffered so many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, do you suppose that God has left you and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you? If you did not suffer, then it were right to suppose this. For if <q>He scourges every son whom He receives,</q> he who is not scourged, perhaps is not a son. What then, you say, do not bad men suffer distress? They suffer indeed; how then? He did not say, Every one  who is scourged is a son, but every son is scourged. For in all cases He scourges His son: what is wanted then is to show, whether any son is not scourged. But you would not be able to say: there are many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men also who are scourged, such as murderers, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, sorcerers, plunderers of tombs. These however are paying the penalty of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and are not scourged as sons, but punished as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: but you as sons.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 12:8</h2>

<p>3. Then again [he argues] from the general custom. Do you see how he brings up arguments from all quarters, from facts in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, from its words, from our own notions, from examples in ordinary life? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse8">Hebrews 12:8</a></span> <q>But if you be without chastisement</q> [&amp;c.]. Do you see that he said what I just mentioned, that it is not possible to be a son without being chastened? For as in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, fathers care not for bastards, though they learn nothing, though they be not distinguished, but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for their legitimate sons lest they should be indolent, [so here.]. If then not to be chastised is [a mark] of bastards, we ought to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at chastisement, if this be [a sign] of legitimacy. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> deals with you as with sons</q>; for this very <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 12:9</h2>

<p><q>Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence.</q> Again, [he reasons] from their own experiences, from what they themselves suffered. For as he says above, <q>Call to mind the former days</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse32">Hebrews 10:32</a></span>, so here also <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></q> (he says) <q>deals with you as with sons,</q> and you could not say, We cannot bear it: yea, <q>as with sons</q> tenderly beloved. For if they reverence their <q>fathers of the flesh,</q> how shall not you reverence your heavenly Father?</p>

<p>However the difference arises not from this alone, nor from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but also from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> itself, and from the fact. For it is not on the same grounds that He and they inflict chastisement: but they [did it] with a view to <q>what seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to them,</q> that is, fulfilling [their own] pleasure oftentimes, and not always looking to what was expedient. But here, that cannot be said. For He does this not for any interest of His own but for you, and for your benefit alone. They [did it] that you might be useful to themselves also, oftentimes without reason; but here there is nothing of this kind. Do you see that this also brings consolation? For we are most closely attached to those [earthly <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>], when we see that not for any interests of their own they either command or advise us: but their earnestness is, wholly and solely, on our account. For this is genuine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in reality, when we are beloved though we be of no use to him who loves us&mdash;not that he may receive, but that he may impart. He chastens, He does everything, He uses all diligence, that we may become capable of receiving His benefits.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 12:10</h2>

<p><q>For they verily</q> (he says) <q>for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure, but He for our profit, that we might be partakers of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse10">Hebrews 12:10</a></span></p>

<p>What is <q>of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a></q>? It is, of His purity, so as to become worthy of Him, according to our power. He earnestly desires that you may receive, and He does all that He may give you: do ye not earnestly endeavor that you may receive? <q>I said unto the Lord</q> (one says) <q>You are my Lord, for of my <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things You have no need.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa015.htm#verse2">Psalm 16:2</a></span></p>

<p><q>Furthermore,</q> he says, <q>we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?</q> (<q>To the Father of spirits,</q> whether of spiritual gifts, or of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, or of the incorporeal powers.) If we die thus, then <q>we shall live. For they indeed for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure,</q> for what seems [so] is not always profitable, but <q>He for our profit.</q></p>

<p>4. Therefore chastisement is <q>profitable</q>; therefore chastisement is a <q>participation of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</q> Yea and this greatly: for when it casts out sloth, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the things of this life, when it helps the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when it causes a light esteem of all things here (for affliction [does] this), is it not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>? Does it not draw down the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit?</p>

<p>Let us consider the righteous, from what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> they all shone brightly forth. Was it not from affliction? And, if you will, let us enumerate them from the first and from the very beginning: Abel, <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> himself; for it is not possible that he, being the only one in that so great multitude of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, should not have been afflicted; for it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> being</q> alone <q>perfect in his generation, pleased God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse9">Genesis 6:9</a></span> For consider, I beseech you, if now, when we have innumerable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> we may emulate, fathers, and children, and teachers, we are thus distressed, what must we suppose he suffered, alone among so many? But should I speak of the circumstances of that strange and wonderful rain? Or should I speak of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, his wanderings one upon another, the carrying away of his wife, the dangers, the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, the famines? Should I speak of Isaac,  what fearful things he underwent, driven from every place, and laboring in vain, and toiling for others? Or of Jacob? For indeed to enumerate all his [afflictions] is not necessary, but it is reasonable to  bring forward the testimony, which he himself [gave] when speaking with <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>; <q>Few and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are my days, and they have not attained to the days of my fathers.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen047.htm#verse9">Genesis 47:9</a></span> Or should I speak of Joseph himself? Or of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Or of Joshua? Or of David? Or of Elijah? Or of Samuel? Or would you [that I speak] of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? Will you not find that all these were made illustrious from their afflictions? Tell me then, dost <em>thou</em> desire to become illustrious from ease and luxury? But you can not.</p>

<p>Or should I speak of the Apostles? Nay but they went beyond all. And Christ said this, <q>In the world you shall have tribulation.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a></span> And again, <q>You shall weep and lament, but the world shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse20">John 16:20</a></span> And, that <q>Strait and narrow is the way  that leads unto life.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse14">Matthew 7:14</a></span> The Lord of the way said, that it is <q>narrow and strait</q>; and do you seek the <q>broad</q> [way]? How is this not unreasonable? In consequence you will not arrive at life, going another [way], but at destruction, for you have chosen the [path] which leads there.</p>

<p>Would you that I bring before you those [that live] in luxury? Let us ascend from the last to the first. The rich man who is burning in the furnace; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who live for the belly, <q>whose god is their belly</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians 3:19</a></span>, who were ever seeking ease in the wilderness, were destroyed; as also those in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, on account of their <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>; and those in the time of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, was it not because they chose this soft and dissolute life? For <q>they luxuriated,</q> it says, <q>in fullness of bread.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse49">Ezekiel 16:49</a></span> It speaks of those in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>. But if <q>fullness of bread</q> wrought so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, what should we say of other delicacies? <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, was not he in ease? And what of those who being of <q>the sons of God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse2">Genesis 6:2</a></span>, looked on <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and were borne down the precipice? And what of those who were maddened by inordinate <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>? And all the kings of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>, of the Egyptians, did they not perish miserably? Are they not in torment?</p>

<p>5. And as to things now, tell me, are they not the same? Hear Christ saying, <q>They that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse8">Matthew 11:8</a></span>, but they who do not [wear] such things, are in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. For the soft garment relaxes even the austere <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, breaks it and enervates it: yea, even if it meet with a body rough and hard, it speedily by such delicate treatment makes it soft and weak.</p>

<p>For, tell me, for what other reason do you suppose <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are so weak? Is it from their sex only? By no means: but from their way of living, and their bringing up. For their avoiding exposure,  their inactivity, their baths, their ointments, their multitude of perfumes, the delicate softness of their couches, makes them in the end such as they are.</p>

<p>And that you may understand, attend to what I say. Tell me; take from a garden a tree from those standing in the uncultivated  part and beaten by the winds, and plant it in a moist and shady place, and you will find it very unworthy of that from which you originally took it. And that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, [appears from the fact that] <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> brought up in the country are stronger than citizens of towns: and they would overcome many such in wrestling. For when the body becomes more effeminate, of necessity the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also shares the mischief, since, for the most part, its energies are affected in accordance with the [body]. For in illness we are different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> owing to weakness, and when we become well, we are different again. For as in the case of a string when the tones  are weak and relaxed, and not well arranged, the excellence of the art is also destroyed, being <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to serve the ill condition of the strings: so in the case of the body also, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receives from it many hurts, many necessities.  For when it needs much nursing, the other endures a bitter servitude.</p>

<p>6. Wherefore, I beseech you, let us make it strong by work, and not nurse it as an invalid.  My discourse is not to men only but to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also. For why do you, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, continually enfeeble  [your body] with luxury and exhaust it?  Why do you ruin your strength with fat? This fat is flabbiness, not strength. Whereas, if you break off from these things, and manage yourself differently, then will your personal beauty also improve according to your wish, when strength and a good habit of body are there. If however thou beset it with ten thousand diseases, there will neither be bloom of complexion, nor good health; for you will always be in low spirits. And you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that as when the air is smiling it makes a beautiful house look splendid, so also cheerfulness of mind when added to a fair countenance, makes it better: but if [a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>] is in low spirits and in pain she becomes more ill-looking. But diseases and pains produce low spirits; and diseases are produced from the body too delicate through great luxury. So that even for this you will flee luxury, if you take my advice.</p>

<p>'But, you will say, luxury gives pleasure.' Yes, but not so great as the annoyances. And besides, the pleasure goes no further than the  palate and the tongue. For when the table has been removed, and the food swallowed, you will be like one that has not partaken, or rather much worse, in that you bear thence oppression, and distension, and headache, and a sleep like death, and often too, sleeplessness from repletion, and obstruction of the breathing, and eructation. And you would curse bitterly your belly, when you ought to curse your immoderate eating.</p>

<p>7. Let us not then fatten the body, but listen to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saying, <q>Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans 13:14</a></span> As if one should take food and throw it into a drain, so is he who throws it into the belly: or rather it is not so, but much worse. For in the one case he uses  the drain without harm to himself: but in the other he generates innumerable diseases. For what nourishes is a sufficiency which also can be digested: but what is over and above our need, not only does not nourish, but even spoils the other. But no man sees these things, owing to some prejudice and unseasonable pleasure.</p>

<p>Do you wish to nourish the body? Take away what is superfluous; give what is sufficient, and as much as can be digested. Do not load it, lest you overwhelm it. A sufficiency is both nourishment and pleasure. For nothing is so productive of pleasure, as food well digested: nothing so [productive of] health: nothing [so productive of] acuteness of the faculties, nothing tends so much to keep away disease. For a sufficiency is both nourishment, and pleasure, and health; but excess is injury, and unpleasantness and disease. For what famine does, that also satiety does; or rather more grievous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For the former indeed within a few days carries a man off and sets him free; but the other eating into and putrefying the body, gives it over to long disease, and then to a most painful death. But <em>we</em>, while we account famine a thing greatly to be dreaded, yet run after satiety, which is more distressing than that.</p>

<p>Whence is this disease? Whence this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>? I do not say that we should waste ourselves away, but that we should eat as much food as also gives us pleasure, that is really pleasure, and can nourish the body, and furnish it to us well ordered and adapted for the energies of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, well joined and fitted together. But when it comes to be water-logged  by luxury, it cannot in the flood-wave, keep fast the bolts  themselves, as one may say, and joints which hold the frame together. For the flood-wave coming in, the whole breaks up and scatters.</p>

<p><q>Make not provision for the flesh</q> (he says) <q>to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans 13:14</a></span> He said well. For luxury is fuel for unreasonable <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; though the luxurious should be the most <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of necessity he must be somewhat affected by wine, by eating, he must needs be relaxed, he must needs endure the greater flame. Hence [come] fornications, hence adulteries. For a hungry belly cannot generate <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or rather not one which has used just enough. But that which generates unseemly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, is that which is relaxed  by luxury. And as land which is very moist and a dung-hill which is wet through and retains much dampness, generates worms, while that which has been freed from such moistness bears abundant fruits, when it has nothing immoderate: even if it be not cultivated, it yields grass, and if it be cultivated, fruits: [so also do we].</p>

<p>Let us not then make our flesh useless, or unprofitable, or hurtful, but let us plant in it useful fruits, and fruit-bearing trees; let us not enfeeble them by luxury, for they too put forth worms instead of fruit when they have become rotten. So also implanted desire, if you moisten it above measure, generates unreasonable pleasures, yea the most exceedingly unreasonable. Let us then remove this pernicious <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that we may be able to attain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things promised us, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, with whom to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> now and ever and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
