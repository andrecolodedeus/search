<h1>Homily 29 on Romans</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse14">Rom. XV. 14</a></p>

<p><q>And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, able also to admonish one another.</q> (So most: S. Chrys. <q>others.</q>)</p>

<p>He had said, <q>Inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, I magnify mine office.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse13">Romans 11:13</a></span> He had said, <q>Take heed lest He also spare not you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse21">Romans 11:21</a></span> He had said, <q>Be not wise in your own conceits</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse16">Romans 12:16</a></span>; and again, <q>Why do you judge your brother?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse10">Romans 14:10</a></span> And, <q>Who are you that judgest another man's servant?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans 14:4</a></span> And several other like things besides. Since then he had often made his language somewhat harsh, he now speaks kindly (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span> <span class="greek">)</span> . And what he said in the beginning, that he does in the end also. At the beginning he said, <q>I thank my God for you all, that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is spoken of throughout the whole world.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse8">Romans 1:8</a></span> But here he says, <q>I am persuaded that you also are full of goodness, being able also to admonish others;</q> and this is more than the former. And he does not say, I have heard, but, <q>I am persuaded,</q> and have no need to hear, from others. And, <q>I myself,</q> that is, I that rebuke, that accuse you. That <q>you are full of goodness,</q> this applies to the exhortation lately given. As if he said, It was not as if you were cruel, or haters of your brethren, that I gave you that exhortation, to receive, and not to neglect, and not to destroy <q>the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For I am aware that <q>you are full of goodness.</q> But he seems to me here to be calling their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> perfect. And he does not say you have, but <q>you are full of.</q> And the sequel is with the same intensitives: <q>filled with all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> For suppose they had been affectionate, but yet did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to treat those they loved properly. This was why he added, <q>all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Able to admonish others,</q> not to learn only, but also to teach.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse15">Ver. 15</a>. <q>Nevertheless, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort.</q></p>

<p>Observe the lowly-mindedness of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, observe his wisdom, how he gave a deep cut in the former part, and then when he had succeeded in what he wished, how he uses much kindliness next. For even without what he has said, this very confession of his having been bold were enough to unstring their vehemency. And this he does in writing to the Hebrews also, speaking as follows, <q>But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things which belong unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, though we thus speak.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse9">Hebrews 6:9</a></span> And to the Corinthians again, <q>Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 11:2</a></span> And in writing to the Galatians he says, <q>I have confidence in you, that you will be none otherwise minded.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse10">Galatians 5:10</a></span> And in all parts of his Epistles one may find this to be frequently observed. But here even in a greater degree. For they were in a higher rank, and there was need to bring down their fastidious spirit, not by astringents only, but by laxatives also. For he does this in different ways. Wherefore he says in this place too, <q>I have written the more boldly unto you,</q> and with this even he is not satisfied, but has added, <q>in some sort,</q> that is, gently; and even here he does not pause, but what does he say? <q>As putting you in mind.</q>  And he does not say as teaching, nor simply putting in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, (<span class="greek">&#x1F00;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>) but he uses a word (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03B9;&#x03BC;&#x03BD;&#x1F75;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>) which means putting you in mind in a quiet way. Observe the end falling in with the introduction. For as in that passage he said, <q>that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in all the world.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse8">Romans 1:8</a></span> So in the end of the Epistle also, <q>For your <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> has reached unto all.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse19">Romans 16:19</a></span> And as in the beginning he wrote, <q>For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established; that is, that I may be comforted together with you</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->ib. 1:11, 12); so here also he said, <q>As putting you in mind.</q> And having come down from the seat of the master, both there and here, he speaks to them as brethren and friends of equal rank. And this is quite a Teacher's duty, to give his address that variety which is profitable to the hearers. See then how after saying, <q>I have written the more boldly,</q> and, <q>in some sort,</q> and, <q>as putting you in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> he was not satisfied even with these, but making his language still more lowly, he proceeds:</p>

<p><q>Because of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that is given me of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> As he said at the beginning, <q>I am a debtor.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse14">Romans 1:14</a></span> As if he had said, I have not snatched at the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> for myself, neither was I first to leap forward to it, but God commanded this, and this too according unto <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not as if He had separated me for this office because I deserved it. Do not ye then be exasperated, since it is not I that raise myself up, but it is God that enjoins it. And as he there says, <q>whom I serve in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of His Son</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse9">Romans 1:9</a></span>, so also here, after saying, <q>because of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given unto me by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he adds,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse16">Ver. 16</a>. <q>That I should be the minister of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, ministering (<span class="greek">&#x1F31;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x1F55;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>) the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>For after his abundant <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his statements, he draws his discourse to a more lofty tone, not speaking of mere service, as in the beginning, but of service and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ministering (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F77; &#x1F76;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>). For to me this is a <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, this preaching and declaring. This is the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> I bring. Now no one will find fault with a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, for being anxious to offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> without blemish. And he says this at once to elevate (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F65;&#x03BD;</span>) their thoughts, and show them that they are a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and in apology for his own part in the matter, because he was appointed to this office. For my knife, he says, is the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, the word of the preaching. And the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not that I may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, not that I may appear conspicuous, but that the <q>offering up (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x1F70;</span>) of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> may be acceptable, being sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q></p>

<p>That is, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those that are taught by me, may be accepted. For it was not so much to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> me, that God led me to this pitch, as out of a concern for you. And how are they to become acceptable? In the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For there is need not only of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but also of a spiritual way of life, that we may keep the Spirit that was given once for all. For it is not wood and fire, nor altar and knife, but the Spirit that is all in us.  For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, I take all means to prevent that Fire from being extinguished, as I have been also enjoined to do. Why then do you speak to those that need it not? This is just the reason why I do not teach you, but put you in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he replies. As the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> stands by stirring up the fire, so I do, rousing up your ready-mindedness. And observe, he does not say, <q>that the offering up of</q> you <q>may be</q> etc. but <q>of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> But when he says of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, he means the whole world, the land, and the whole sea, to take down their haughtiness, that they might not disdain to have him for a teacher, who was putting himself forth (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;&#x1F79;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) to the very end of the world. As he said in the beginning, <q>as among the other <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also, I am a debtor to Greeks, and also to barbarians, to wise, and to foolish.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse13">Romans 1:13-14</a></span></p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse17">Ver. 17</a>. <q>I have therefore whereof I may <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, in those things which pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>Inasmuch as he had humbled himself exceedingly, he again raised his style, doing this also for their sakes, lest he should seem to become readily an object of contempt. And while he raises himself, he remembers his own proper temper, and says, <q>I have therefore whereof to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> I <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, he means, not in myself, not in our <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, but in the <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse18">Ver. 18</a>. <q>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not wrought by me, to make <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> by word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> </p>

<p>And none, he means, can say that my words are a mere boast. For of this <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ministry of mine, the signs that I have, and the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the appointment too, are many. Not the long garment (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B4;&#x1F75;&#x03C1;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;</span>) and the bells as they of old, nor the mitre and the turban (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x1F77;&#x03B4;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span>), but signs and wonders, far more awful than these. Nor can it be said that I have been entrusted indeed with the charge, but yet have not executed it. Or rather, it is not I that have executed, but Christ. Wherefore also it is in Him that I boast, not about common things, but about spiritual. And this is the force of, <q>in things which pertain to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For that I have accomplished the purpose for which I was sent, and that my words are not mere boast, the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> show. <q>For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not wrought by me, to make the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> by word and deed, through signs and wonders, by the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> See how violently he tries to show that the whole is God's doing, and nothing his own. For whether I speak anything, or do anything, or work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, He does all of them, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> all. And this he says to show the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> also. See how these things are more wondrous and more awful than those of old, the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, the offering, the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>. For when he says, <q>in word and deed, through mighty signs and wonders,</q> he means this, the doctrine, the system (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03C6;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>) relating to the Kingdom, the exhibition of actions and conversation, the dead that were raised, the devils that were cast out, and the blind that were healed, and the lame that leaped, and the other marvellous acts, all whereof the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> wrought in us. Then the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of these things (since all this is yet but an assertion) is the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Wherefore he adds, <q>So that from Jerusalem, and round about unto <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, I have fully preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Count up then cities, and places, and nations, and peoples, not those under the Romans only, but those also under barbarians. For I would not have you go the whole way through <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and the Cilicians, and Cappadocians, but reckon up also the parts behind,  the country of the Saracens, and Persians, and Armenians, and that of the other savage nations. For this is why he said, <q>round about,</q> that you might not only go through the direct high road, but that you should run over the whole, even the southern part of Asia in your mind. And as he ran over <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> thick as snow, in a single word, by saying, <q>through mighty signs and wonders,</q> so he has comprehended again endless cities, and nations, and peoples, and places, in this one word <q>round about.</q> For he was far removed from all boasting. And this, he said on their account, so that they should not be conceited about themselves. And at the beginning he said, that <q>I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> But here he states the compulsion of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. For as he had spoken in a sharper tone, he shows also by it his power more clearly. This is why he there only says, <q>even as among other <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> But here he insists on the topic fully, so that the conceit may be pruned away on all grounds. And he does not merely say, preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, but <q>have fully preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> </p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse20">Ver. 20</a>. <q>Yea, so have I strived to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, not where Christ was named.</q></p>

<p>See here another preeminence; that he had not only preached the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to so many, and persuaded them, but he did not even go to those who had become <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. So far was he from thrusting himself upon other men's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and from doing this for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory's</a> sake, that he even made it a point to teach those who had not heard. For neither does he say where they were not persuaded, but <q>where Christ was not even named,</q> which is more. And what was the reason why he had this ambition? <q>Lest I should build,</q> he says, <q>upon another man's foundation.</q></p>

<p>This he says to show himself a stranger to vanity, and to instruct them that it was not from any <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from them, that he came to write, but as fulfilling his ministry, as perfecting his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> duty, as loving their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But he calls the foundation of the Apostles <q>another man's,</q> not in regard to the quality of the person, or the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of preaching, but in regard to the question of reward. For it was not that the preaching was that of another man,  but so far as it went to another man's reward. For the reward of the labors of others was, to this man, another man's. Then he shows that a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was fulfilled also saying,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse21">Ver. 21</a>. <q>As it is written, To whom He was not spoken of, they shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa003.htm#verse15">Isaiah 3:15</a> [<a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a>]</span></p>

<p>You see he runs to where the labor is more, the toil greater.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse22">Ver. 22</a>. <q>For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also I have been much hindered from coming to you.</q></p>

<p>Observe again, how he makes the end of the like texture with the introduction. For while he was quite at the beginning of the Epistle, he said, <q>Oftentimes I purpose to come unto you, but was let hitherto.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse13">Romans 1:13</a></span> But here he gives the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also by which he was let, and that not once, but twice even, aye, and many times. For as he says there, <q>oftentimes I purposed to come to you,</q> so here too, <q>I have been much (or often, <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x1F70;</span>) hindered from coming to you.</q> Now it is a thing which proves a very strong desire, that he attempted it so often.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse23">Ver. 23</a>. <q>But now having no more place in these parts.</q></p>

<p>See how he shows that it was not from any <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from them, that he both wrote and was also coming. <q>And having a great desire to come to you these many years,</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse24">Ver. 24</a>. <q>Whenever I take my journey into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, I trust to see you in my journey; and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company,</q></p>

<p>For that he might not seem to be holding them very cheap, by saying, Since I have not anything to do, therefore I am coming to you, he again touches on the point of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by saying, <q>I have a great desire, these many years, to come unto you.</q> For the reason why I desire to come, is not because I am disengaged, but that I may give birth to that desire wherewith I am travailing so long. Then that this again should not puff them up, consider how he lowers them by saying, <q>Whenever I take my journey into <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, I trust to see you in my journey.</q> For this was why he stated this, that they should not be high-minded. For what he wants is to show his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and at the same time to prevent them from being dainty. And so he places this close on the other, and uses things confirmative of either alternately. For this reason again that they might not say, Do you make us a by-object of your journey? He adds, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you: that is, that you may be my witnesses that it is not through any slight of you, but by force of necessity, that I run by you. But as this is still distressing, he heals it over more carefully, by saying, <q>If I be first somewhat filled with your company.</q> For by his saying, <q>in my journey,</q> he shows that he did not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> their good opinion. But by saying <q>be filled,</q> that he was eager for their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and not only was eager for it, but exceedingly so; and this is why he does not say <q>be filled,</q> but be <q>somewhat</q> so. That is, no length of time can fill me or create in me a satiety of your company. See how he shows his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, when even though in haste he does not rise up until he be filled. And this is a sign of his great affectionateness, that he uses his words in so warm a way. For he does not say even I will see, but <q>shall be filled,</q> imitating thus the language of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. And at the beginning he said, <q>that I might have some fruit.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse13">Romans 1:13</a></span> But here that I may be <q>filled.</q> And both these are like a person who is drawing others to him. For the one was a very great commendation of them, if they were likely to yield him fruit from their <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; and the other, a genuine <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his own friendship. And in writing to the Corinthians he thus says, <q>That ye may bring me on my journey wherever I go</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 16:6</a></span>, so in all ways exhibiting an unrivalled <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And so at the beginning of all his Epistles it is with this he starts, and at the end in this he concludes again. For as an indulgent father does an only and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> born son, so did he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Whence it was that he said, <q>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2 Corinthians 11:29</a></span></p>

<p>For before everything else this is what the teacher ought to have. Wherefore also to Peter Christ says, <q>If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me, feed My sheep.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse16">John 21:16</a></span> For he who loves Christ loves also His flock. And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> too did He then set over the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when he had shown a kindly feeling towards them. And David in this way came to be king, having been first seen to be affectionately-minded towards them; so much indeed, though yet young, did he grieve for the people, as to risk his life for them, when he killed that barbarian. But if he said, <q>What shall be done to the man that kills this <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa019.htm#verse5">1 Samuel 19:5</a>; ib. 17:26</span> he said it not in order to demand a reward, but out of a wish to have confidence placed in himself, and to have the battle with him delivered to his charge. And therefore, when he came to the king after the victory, he said nothing of these things. And Samuel too was very affectionate; whence it was that he said, <q>But God forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in ceasing to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto the Lord for you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa012.htm#verse23">1 Samuel 12:23</a></span> In like way <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, or rather not in like way, but even in a far greater degree, burned towards all his subjects (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F65;&#x03BD; &#x1F00;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>). Wherefore he made his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of such affection towards himself, that he said, <q>If were possible, you would have pulled out your eyes and given them to me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse15">Galatians 4:15</a></span> On this ground too it is, that God charges the teachers of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> above all things with this, saying, <q>Oh shepherds of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, do shepherds feed themselves? Do they not feed the flock?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse2">Ezekiel 34:2-3</a></span> But they did the reverse. For he says, <q>You eat the milk, and clothe you with the wool, and you kill them that are fed, but you feed not the flock.</q> And Christ, in bringing out the rule for the fittest Pastor, said, <q>The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John 10:11</a></span> This David did also, both on sundry other occasions, and also when that fearful <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> from above came down upon the whole people. For while all were being slain he said, <q>I the shepherd  have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, I the shepherd have done amiss, and these the flock what have they done?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2sa024.htm#verse17">2 Samuel 24:17</a></span> And so in the choice of those punishments also, he chose not famine, nor flight before enemies, but the pestilence sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereby he hoped to place all the others in safety, but that he should himself in preference to all the rest be carried off. But since this was not so, he bewails, and says, <q>On me be Your Hand:</q> or if this be not enough, <q>on my father's house</q> also. <q>For I,</q> he says, <q>the shepherd have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> As though he had said, that if they also <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, I was the person who should suffer the vengeance, as I corrected them not. But since the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is mine also, it is I who deserve to suffer the vengeance. For wishing to increase the crime he used the name of <q>Shepherd.</q> Thus then he stayed the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, thus he got the sentence revoked! So great is the power of confession. <q>For the righteous is his own accuser first.</q>  So great is the concern and sympathy of a good Pastor. For his bowels were writhed at their falling, as when one's own children are killed. And on this ground he begged that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> might come upon himself. And in the beginning of the slaughter he would have done this, unless he had seen it advancing and expected that it would come to himself. When therefore he saw that this did not happen, but that the calamity was raging among them, he no longer forebore, but was touched more than for Amnon his <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>. For then he did not ask for death, but now he begs to fall in preference to the others. Such ought a ruler to be and to grieve rather at the calamities of others than his own.  Some such thing he suffered in his son's case likewise, that you might see that he did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his son more than his subjects, and yet the youth was unchaste, and an ill-user of his father (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>), and still he said, <q>Would that I might have died for you!</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2sa018.htm#verse33">2 Samuel 18:33</a></span> What do you say, thou blessed one, you meek of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? Your son was set upon killing you, and compassed you about with ills unnumbered. And when he had been removed, and the trophy was raised, do you then <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to be slain? Yea, he says, for it is not for me that the army has been victorious, but I am warred against more violently than before, and my bowels are now more torn than before. These however were all thoughtful for those committed to their charge, but the blessed <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> concerned himself much even for those that were not entrusted to him, and so much so as even to throw himself among alarming dangers. For when he did what he did, not for his nephew only, but for the people of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> also, he did not leave driving those Persians before him until he had set them all free: and yet he might have departed after he had taken him, yet he did not choose it. For he had the like concern for all, and this he showed likewise by his subsequent conduct. When then it was not a host of barbarians that was on the point of laying siege to them, but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God that was plucking their cities up from the foundations, and it was no longer the time for arms, and battle, and array, but for supplication; so great was the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> he showed for them, as, if he himself had been on the point of perishing. For this reason he comes once, twice, thrice, aye and many times to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and finds a refuge (i.e. an excuse) in his nature by saying, <q>I am dust and ashes</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse27">Genesis 18:27</a></span>: and since he saw that they were traitors to themselves, he begs that they may be saved for others. Wherefore also God said, <q>I will hide not from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> My servant that thing which I am about to do</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse17">Genesis 18:17</a></span>, that we might learn how loving to man the righteous is. And he would not have left off beseeching, unless God had left off first <span class="stiki">so he takes <a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse33">Genesis 18:33</a></span>. And he seems indeed to be <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the just, but is doing the whole for them. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the Saints are very gentle and, loving unto man, both in regard to their own, and to strangers. And even to the unreasoning creatures they extend their gentleness. Wherefore also a certain wise man said, <q>The righteous pities the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of his cattle.</q>  But if he does those of cattle, how much more those of men. But since I have mentioned cattle, let us just consider the shepherds of the sheep who are in the Cappadocian land, and what they suffer in kind and degree in their guardianship of unreasoning creatures. They often stay for three days together buried down under the snows. And those in Libya are said to undergo no less hardships than these, ranging about for whole months through that wilderness, dreary as it is, and filled with the direst wild beasts (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B7;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> may include serpents). Now if for unreasonable things there be so much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, what defense are we to set up, who are entrusted with reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and yet slumber on in this deep sleep? For is it right to be at rest, and in quiet, and not to be running about everywhere, and giving one's self up to endless deaths in behalf of these sheep? Or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye not the dignity of this flock? Was it not for this that your Master took endless pains, and afterwards poured forth His blood? And do you seek for rest? Now what can be worse than these Shepherds? Do you not perceive, that there stand round about these sheep wolves much more fierce and savage than those of this world? Do you not think with yourself, what a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> he ought to have who is to take in hand this office? Now men that lead the populace, if they have but common matters to deliberate on, add days to nights in watching. And we that are struggling in heaven's behalf sleep even in the daytime. And who is now to deliver us from the punishment for these things? For if the body were to be cut in pieces, if to undergo ten thousand deaths, ought one not to run to it as to a feast? And let not the shepherds only, but the sheep also hear this; that they may make the shepherds the more active minded, that they may the more encourage their good-will: I do not mean by anything else but by yielding all compliance and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. Thus <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also bade them, saying, <q>Obey them which have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as they that must give account.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse17">Hebrews 13:17</a></span> And when he says, <q>watch,</q> he means thousands of labors, cares and dangers. For the good Shepherd, who is such as Christ wishes for, is contending, before countless witnesses. For He died once for him; but this man ten thousand times for the flock, if, that is, he be such a shepherd as he ought to be; for such an one can die every day. <span class="stiki">See on <a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse36">Romans 8:36</a></span> And therefore do ye, as being acquainted with what the labor is, co&ouml;perate with them, with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, with readiness, with affection, that both we may have to boast of you, and you of us. For on this ground He entrusted this to the chief  of the Apostles, who also loved Him more than the rest; after first asking him if He was loved by him, that you may learn that this before other things, is held as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to Him. For this requires a vigorous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. This I have said of the best shepherds; not of myself and those of our days, but of any one that may be such as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was, such as Peter, such as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. These then let us imitate, both the rulers of us and the ruled. For the ruled may be in the place of a shepherd to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to his friends, to his servants, to his wife, to his children: and if we so order our affairs we shall attain to all manner of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Which God grant that we may all attain unto, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward man, etc.</p>
