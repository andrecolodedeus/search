<h1>Homily 2 on Titus</h1>

<p class="c12"><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Titus 1:5, 6</span>  </p>

<p><q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city as I had appointed you: If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</q></p>

<p>The whole life of men in ancient times was one of action and contention; ours on the contrary is a life of indolence. They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they were brought into the world for this purpose, that they might labor according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who brought them into it; but we, as if we had been placed here but to eat and drink, and lead a life of pleasure, we pay no regard to spiritual things. I speak not only of the Apostles, but of those that followed them. You see them accordingly traversing all places, and pursuing this as their only business, living altogether as in a foreign land, as those who had no city upon earth. Hear therefore what the blessed Apostle says,</p>

<p><q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> left I you in Crete.</q></p>

<p>As if the whole world had been one house, they divided it among themselves, administering its affairs everywhere, each taking care of his several portion of it.</p>

<p><q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are [R.V. were] wanting.</q></p>

<p>He does not command this in an imperious manner; <q>that you should set in order,</q> he says. Here we see a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> free from all <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, seeking everywhere the advantage of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, not curiously solicitous, whether the good was done by himself or by another. For where there was a case of danger and great difficulty, he in his own person set it in order. But those things which were rather attended with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and praise he committed to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, as the ordination of Bishops, and such other things as required some farther arrangement,  or, so to speak, to be brought to greater perfection. What do you say? Does he farther set in order your work? And do you not think it a disgrace bringing shame upon you? By no means; for I look only to the common good, and whether it be done by me, or by another, it makes no difference to me. Thus it becomes him to be affected who presides in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not to seek his own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but the common good.</p>

<p><q>And ordain elders in every city,</q> here he is speaking of Bishops, as we have before said,  <q>as I had appointed you. If any is blameless.</q> <q>In every city,</q> he says, for he did not wish the whole island to be entrusted to one, but that each should have his own charge and care, for thus he would have less labor himself, and those under his rule would receive greater attention, if the Teacher had not to go about to  the presidency of many Churches, but was left to be occupied with one only, and to bring that into order.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse6">Ver. 6</a>. <q>If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</q></p>

<p>Why does he bring forward such an one? To stop the mouths of those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who condemned marriage, showing that it is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> thing in itself, but so far <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, that a married man might ascend the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> throne; and at the same reproving the wanton, and not permitting their admission into this high office who contracted a second marriage. For he who retains no kind regard for her who is departed, how shall he be a good president? And what accusation would he not incur? For you all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that though it is not forbidden by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> to enter into a second marriage, yet it is a thing liable to many ill constructions. Wishing therefore a ruler to give no handle for reproach to those under his rule, he on this account says, <q>If any be blameless,</q>  that is, if his life be free from reproach, if he has given occasion to no one to assail his character. Hear what Christ says, <q>If the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that darkness!</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse23">Matthew 6:23</a></span></p>

<p><q>Having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</q></p>

<p>We should observe what care he bestows upon children. For he who cannot be the instructor of his own children, how should he be the Teacher of others? If he cannot keep in order those whom he has had with him from the beginning, whom he has brought up, and over whom he had power both by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and by nature, how will he be able to benefit those without? For if the incompetency  of the father had not been great, he would not have allowed those to become bad whom from the first he had under his power. For it is not possible, indeed it is not, that one should turn out ill who is brought up with much care, and has received great attention. Sins are not so prevalent by nature, as to overcome so much previous care. But if, occupied in the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, he has made his children a secondary concern, and not bestowed much care upon them, even so he is unworthy. For if when nature prompted, he was so void of affection or so senseless, that he thought more of his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> than of his children, how should he be raised to the Episcopal throne, and so great rule? For if he was unable to restrain them it is a great <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his weakness; and if he was unconcerned, his want of affection is much to be blamed. He then that neglects his own children, how shall he take care of other men's? And he has not only said, <q>not riotous,</q> but not even <q>accused of riot.</q> There must not be an ill report, or such an opinion of them.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse7">Ver. 7</a>. <q>For a Bishop must be blameless, as the steward of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not self-willed, not soon <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, not given to wine, no striker.</q></p>

<p>For a ruler without, as he rules by law and compulsion, perhaps does not consult the wishes of those under his rule. But he who ought to rule men with their own consent, and who will be thankful for his rule, if he so conduct himself as to do everything of his own will, and share counsels with no one, makes his presidency tyrannical rather than popular. For he must be <q>blameless, as the steward of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not self-willed, not soon <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</q> For how shall he instruct others to rule that passion, who has not taught himself? For power leads on to many <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, it makes a man more harsh and difficult to please, even him that was very mild, surrounding him with so many occasions of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. If he have not previously practiced himself in this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he will grow harsh, and will injure and destroy much that is under his rule.</p>

<p><q>Not given to wine,  no striker.</q> Here he is speaking of the insolent man. For he should do all things by admonition or rebuke, and not by insolence. What necessity, tell me, for insult? He ought to terrify, to alarm, to penetrate the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the threat of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. But he that is insulted becomes more impudent, and rather despises him that insults him. Nothing produces contempt more than insult; it disgraces the insolent person, and prevents his being respected, as he ought to be. Their discourse ought to be delivered with much caution. In reproving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they should bear in mind the future judgment, but keep clear of all insolence. Yet if any prevent them from doing their duty, they must prosecute the matter with all authority. <q>Not a striker,</q> he says. The teacher is the physician of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. But the physician does not strike, but heals and restores him that has stricken him. <q>Not given to filthy lucre.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse8">Ver. 8</a>. <q>But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, temperate.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse9">Ver. 9</a>. <q>Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught.</q></p>

<p>You see what intensity of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> he required. <q>Not given to filthy lucre,</q> that is, showing great contempt for money. <q>A lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a></q>; he means, giving away all his substance to them that need. <q>Temperate</q>; he speaks not here of one who <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, but of one who commands his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, his tongue, his hands, his eyes. For this is <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, to be drawn aside by no passion.</p>

<p><q>Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught.</q> By <q>faithful</q> is here meant <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q> or that which was delivered through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not requiring reasonings, or questionings.</p>

<p><q>Holding fast,</q> that is, having care of it, making it his business. What then, if he be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the learning that is without? For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, he says, <q>the faithful word, according to teaching.</q> </p>

<p><q>That he may be able both to exhort, and to convince the gainsayers.</q></p>

<p>So that there is need not of pomp of words, but of strong minds, of skill in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and of powerful thoughts. Do you not see that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> put to flight the whole world, that he was more powerful than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and all the rest? But it was by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, you say. Not by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> only, for if you peruse the Acts of the Apostles, you will find him often prevailing by his teaching previously to his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.</p>

<p><q>That he may be able by sound doctrine to exhort,</q> that is, to retain his own people, and to overthrow the adversaries. <q>And to convince the gainsayers.</q> For if this is not done, all is lost. He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how to combat the adversaries, and to <q>bring every thought into captivity to the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> and to beat down reasonings, he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what he ought to teach with regard to right doctrine, far from him be the Teacher's throne. For the other qualities may be found in those under his rule, such as to be <q>blameless, to have his children in subjection, to be hospitable, just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q> But that which characterizes the Teacher is this, to be able to instruct in the word, to which no regard is now paid.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse10">Ver. 10</a>. <q>For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially they of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>;</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse11">Ver. 11</a>. <q>Whose mouths must be stopped.</q></p>

<p>Do you see how he shows that they are such? From their not wishing to be ruled, but to rule. For he has glanced at this. When therefore you can not persuade them, do not give them charges, but stop their mouths, for the benefit of others. But of what advantage will this be, if they will not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, or are unruly? Why then should he stop their mouths? In order that others may be benefited by it.</p>

<p><q>Who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucre's sake.</q></p>

<p>For if he has undertaken the office of a Teacher, and is not able to combat these enemies, and to stop their mouths who are so shameless, he will become in each case the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their destination who perish. And if some one has thus advised, <q>Seek not to be a judge, unless you can take away iniquity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse6">Sirach 7:6</a></span>; much more may we say here, <q>Seek not to be a Teacher, if you are unequal to the dignity of the office; but though dragged to it, decline it.</q> Do you see that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of power,  the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of filthy lucre, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? <q>Teaching things which they ought not,</q> he says, <q>for filthy lucre's sake.</q></p>

<p>Moral . For there is nothing which is not spoiled by these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But as when violent winds, falling on a calm sea, turn it up from its foundation, and mingle the sand with the waves, so these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> assailing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> turn all upside down, and dim the clearness of the mental sight, but especially does the mad desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For a contempt for money any one may easily attain, but to despise the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that proceeds from the multitude, requires a great effort, a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> temper, a certain angelic <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that reaches to the very summit of heaven. For there is no passion so tyrannical, so universally prevalent, in a greater or less degree indeed, but still everywhere. How then shall we subdue it, if not wholly, yet in some little part? By looking up to heaven, by setting God before our eyes, by entertaining thoughts superior to earthly things. Imagine, when you desire <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that you have already attained it, and mark the end, and you will find it to be nothing. Consider with what loss it is attended, of how many and how great blessings it will deprive you. For you will undergo the toils and danger, yet be deprived of the fruits and rewards of them. Consider that the majority are bad, and despise their opinion. In the case of each individual, consider what the man is, and you will see how ridiculous a thing is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that it is rather to be called shame.</p>

<p>And after this, lift up your thoughts to the theater  above. When in doing any good you consider that it ought to be displayed to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and you seek for some spectators of the action, and art in travail to be seen, reflect that God beholds you, and all that desire will be extinguished. Retire from the earth, and look to that theater that is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. If men should praise you, yet hereafter they will blame you, will <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> you, will assail your character; or if they do not, yet their praise will not benefit you. It is not so with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He delights in praising our <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Have you spoken well, and obtained applause? What have you gained? For if those who applauded you were benefited, changed in their minds, become better men, and had desisted from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, then might thou indeed <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, not at the praises bestowed, but at the wonderful change for the better. But if they continue their praises, and loud plaudits, but gain no good by what they applaud, you ought rather to grieve: for these things turn to their judgment and condemnation.  But you obtain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. If you are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and conscious of no guilt, you should <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, not because thou are reputed <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, but because you are so. But if, without being so, you desire the good opinion of the multitude, consider that they will not be your judges at the last day, but He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> perfectly the things that are hid. And if while conscious of guilt, you are supposed by all to be pure, instead of rejoicing, you should grieve and mourn bitterly, keeping constantly in view that Day, in which all things will be revealed, in which the hidden things of darkness will be brought to light.</p>

<p>Do you enjoy <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>? Reject it, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it renders you a debtor. Does no one <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> you? You ought to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at it. For God will not lay  to your charge this, among other things, that you have enjoyed <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Do you see not that God upbraids <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> with this among other things, by his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>I took of your sons for Prophets, and of your young men for sanctification</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/amo002.htm#verse11">Amos 2:11</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> You will therefore gain this advantage at least, that you will not aggravate your punishment. For he who is not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in the present life, who is despised, and held in no consideration, but is insulted and scorned, gains this at least, if nothing else, that he has not to answer for being <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by his fellow-servants.  And on many other accounts he gains  by it. He is brought down and humbled, nor if he would, can he be high-minded, if  he takes the more heed to himself. But he, who enjoys more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, besides being responsible for great debts, is lifted up into arrogance and vainglory, and becomes the slave of men; and as this tyranny increases, he is compelled to do many things which he would not.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> therefore that it is better to want <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, than to possess it, let us not seek for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, but evade them when they are offered, let us cast them from us, let us extinguish that desire. This we have said at once to the rulers of the church, and to those under their rule. For a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desirous of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and of being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, shall not see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. This is not my own saying. I speak not my own words, but those of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. He shall not see it, though he practice <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For he says, <q>They have their reward.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse5">Matthew 6:5</a></span> He then, who has no reward to receive, how shall he see the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>? I forbid you not to desire <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but I would wish it to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that which proceeds from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Whose praise,</q> it is said, <q>is not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse29">Romans 2:29</a></span> Let us be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> in secret, not cumbered with parade, and show, and hypocrisy. Let us cast away the sheep's clothing, and rather let us become sheep. Nothing is more worthless than the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of men. Should thou see a company of little children, mere sucklings, would you desire <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from them?  Be thus affected towards all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> with respect to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p>It is for this reason called vainglory. Do you see the masks worn by stage-players? How beautiful and splendid they are, fashioned to the extreme height of elegance. Can you show me any such real countenance? By no means. What then? Did you ever fall in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with them? No. Wherefore? Because they are empty, imitating beauty, but not being really beautiful. Thus <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is empty, and an imitation of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: it is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. That beauty only which is natural, which is within, is lasting: that which is put on externally often conceals deformity, conceals it from men until the evening. But when the theater breaks up, and the masks are taken off, each appears what he really is.</p>

<p>Let us therefore pursue <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not be as if we were on the stage and acting a part. For of what advantage is it, tell me, to be gazed at by a multitude? It is vainglory, and nothing else. For return to your house, and solitude, and immediately all is gone. You have gone to the market-place, you have turned upon you the eyes of all present. What have you gained? Nothing. It vanished, and passed away like dissolving smoke. Do we then <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> things thus unsubstantial? How unreasonable is this! What <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>! To one thing only let us look, to the never seek the praise of men; but if it falls to us, we shall despise, deride, and reject it. We shall be affected as those who desire gold, but receive clay. Let not any one praise you, for it profits nothing; and if he blame you, it harms you not. But with God praise and blame are attended with real gain and loss, while all is vain that proceeds from men. And herein we are made like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He needs not <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from men. <q>I receive not,</q> said Christ, <q><a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from men.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse41">John 5:41</a></span> Is this then a light thing, tell me? When you are unwilling to despise <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, say, <q>By despising it, I shall resemble <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and immediately you will despise it. But it is impossible that the slave of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should not be a slave to all, more servile than slaves in reality. For we do not impose upon our slaves such tasks, as <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> exacts from her captives. Base and shameful are the things she makes them say, and do,  and suffer, and when she sees them <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a>, she is the more urgent in her commands.</p>

<p>Let us fly then, I entreat you, let us fly from this slavery. But how shall we be able? If we think seriously  of what is in this world, if we observe that things present are a dream, a shadow, and nothing better; we shall easily overcome this desire, and neither in little nor in great things shall be led captive by it. But if in little things we do not despise it, we shall easily be overcome by it in the most important. Let us therefore remove far from us the sources of it, and these are, folly, and meanness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that, if we assume a lofty spirit, we shall be able to look beyond <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from the multitude, and to extend our views to heaven, and obtain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things there. Of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant that we may all be partakers, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom, etc.</p>
