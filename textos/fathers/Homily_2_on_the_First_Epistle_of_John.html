<h1>Homily 2 on the First Epistle of John</h1>

<h2>1 John 2:12-17</h2>

<p>I write unto you, little children, because your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven through His name. I write unto you, fathers, because you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you have overcome the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one. I write unto you, children, because you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Father. I write  unto you, fathers, because you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one. Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, is the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life, which is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but is of the world. And the world passes away, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof: but he that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides for ever (even as God also abides for ever).</p>

<p>1. All things that are read from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> in order to our instruction and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, it behooves us to hear with earnest heed. Yet most of all must those things be commended to our memory, which are of most force against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; whose insidious designs cease not to circumvent all that are weaker and more negligent. Remember that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> both died for us, and rose again; died, to wit, for our offenses, rose again for our justification. <span class="stiki" id="note172070"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;4:25</a></span> Even as you have just heard concerning the two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> whom He met with in the way, how <q>their eyes were holden that they should not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172071"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;24:13-28</a></span> and He found them despairing of the redemption that was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and deeming that now He had suffered and was dead as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, not accounting that as <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> He ever lives; and deeming too that He was so dead in the flesh as not to come to life again, but just as one of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: as those of you who were attentive have just now heard their own words. Then <q>He opened to them the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, beginning at <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q> and going through all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, showing them that all He had suffered had been foretold, lest they should be more staggered if the Lord should rise again, and the more fail to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him, if these things had not been told before concerning Him. For the firmness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is in this, that all things which came to pass in Christ were foretold. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, then, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not, save <q>in the breaking of bread.</q> And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> he that eats and drinks not judgment to himself in the breaking of bread does <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ. <span class="stiki" id="note172072"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> Afterward also those eleven <q>thought they saw a spirit.</q> He gave Himself to be handled by them, who also gave Himself to be crucified; to be crucified by enemies, to be handled by friends: yet the Physician of all, both of the ungodliness of those, and of the unbelief of these. For you heard when the Acts of the Apostles were read, how many thousands of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> slayers <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note172073"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse41">Acts&nbsp;2:41</a></span> If those <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> afterwards who had killed, should not those <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> who for a little while <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>? And yet even in regard of them, (a thing which you ought especially to observe, and to commit to your memory, because that which shall make us strong against insidious <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, God has been pleased to put in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, against which no man dares to speak, who in any sort wishes to seem a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>), when He had given Himself to be handled by them, that did not suffice Him, but He would also confirm by means of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> the heart of them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: for He looked forward to us who should be afterwards; seeing that in Him we have nothing that we can handle, but have that which we may read. For if those <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> only because they held and handled, what shall we do? Now, Christ is ascended into heaven; He is not to come save at the end, to judge the quick and the dead. Whereby shall we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but by that whereby it was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that even those who handled Him should be confirmed? For He opened to them the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and showed them that it behooved Christ to suffer, and that all things should be fulfilled which were written of Him in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>, and the Prophets, and the Psalms. He embraced in His discourse the whole ancient text of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. All that there is of those former Scriptures tells of Christ; but only if it find ears. He also <q>opened their understanding that they might understand the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.</q> Whence we also must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for this, that He would open our understanding.</p>

<p>2. But what did the Lord show written of Him in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">Law of Moses</a>, and the Prophets, and the Psalms? What did He show? Let Himself say. The <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> has put this briefly, that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what in all that great compass of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> we ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and to understand. Certainly there are many pages, and many books; the contents of them all is this which the Lord briefly spoke to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. What is this? That <q>it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again the third day.</q> You have it now concerning the Bridegroom, that <q>it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise again:</q> the Bridegroom has been set forth to us. Concerning the Bride, let us see what He says; that you, when you know the Bridegroom and the Bride, may not without reason come to the marriage. For every celebration is a celebration of marriage: the Church's nuptials are celebrated. The King's Son is about to marry a wife, and that King's Son is Himself a King: and the guests frequenting the marriage are themselves the Bride. Not, as in a carnal marriage, some are guests, and another is she that is married; in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they that come as guests, if they come to good purpose, become the Bride. For all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is Christ's Bride, of which the beginning and first fruits is the flesh of Christ: there was the Bride joined to the Bridegroom in the flesh. With good reason when He would betoken that same flesh, He broke bread, and with good reason <q>in the breaking of bread,</q> the eyes <q>of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were opened, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him.</q> Well then, what did the Lord say was written of Him in the Law and Prophets and Psalms? That <q>it behooved Christ to suffer.</q> Had He not added, <q>and to rise again,</q> well might those mourn whose eyes were holden; but <q>to rise again</q> is also foretold. And wherefore this? Why did it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise again? Because of that Psalm which we especially commended to your attention on the fourth day, the first station, of last week.  Why did it behoove Christ to suffer and to rise again? For this reason: <q>All the ends of the earth shall be reminded and converted unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Him.</q>  For that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it behooved Christ to suffer and to rise again; in this place also what has He added, that after setting forth the Bridegroom He might also set forth the Bride? <q>And that there be preached,</q> says He, <q>in His name, repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</q> You have heard, brethren; hold it fast. Let no man <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that it is <q>throughout all nations:</q> let no man <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that it began at Jerusalem, and has filled all nations. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the field where the Vine is planted: but when it is grown we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not, because it has taken up the whole. Whence did it begin? <q>At Jerusalem.</q> Whither has it come? To <q>all nations.</q> A few remain: it shall possess all. In the mean time, while it is taking possession of all, it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the Husbandman to cut off some unprofitable branches, and they have made <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms. Let not the branches that are cut off induce you to be cut off: rather exhort them that are cut off that they be grafted in again. It is manifest that Christ has suffered, is risen again, and is ascended into heaven: made manifest also is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because there is <q>preached in His name repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> throughout all nations.</q> Whence did it begin? <q>Beginning at Jerusalem.</q> The man hears this; foolish and vain, and (how, shall I express it?) worse than blind! so great a mountain, and he does not see it; a candle set upon a candlestick, and he shuts his eyes against it!</p>

<p>3. When we say to them, If you be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, communicate with that Church from which the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is spread abroad over the whole earth: communicate with that Jerusalem:  when this we say to them, they make answer to us, we do not communicate with that city where our King was slain, where our Lord was slain: as though they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the city where our Lord was slain. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> slew Him whom they found on earth, these scorn  Him that sits in heaven! Which are the worse; those who despised Him because they thought Him man, or those who scorn the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of Him whom now they confess to be God? But they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, forsooth, the city in which their Lord was slain! Pious men, and merciful! They much grieve that Christ was slain, and in men they slay Christ! But He loved that city, and pitied it: from it He bade the preaching of Him begin, <q>beginning at Jerusalem.</q> He made there the beginning of the preaching of His name: and you shrink back with horror from having communion with that city!  No marvel that being cut off you hate the root. What said He to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>? <q>Sit still in the city, because I send my promise  upon you.</q> Behold what the city is that they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>! Haply they would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it, if Christ's murderers dwelt in it. For it is manifest that all Christ's murderers, <em>i.e.</em>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, are expelled from that city.  That which had in it them that were fierce against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has now them that adore Christ. Therefore do these men <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> it, because <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are in it. There was it His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should tarry, and there that He should send to them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Where had the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> its commencement, but where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came from heaven, and filled the hundred and twenty sitting in one place? That number twelve was made tenfold. They sat, an hundred and twenty <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came, <q>and filled the whole place, and there came a sound, as it were the rushing of a mighty wind, and there were cloven tongues like as of fire.</q> You have heard the Acts of the Apostles: this was the lesson read today:  <q>They began to speak with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.</q> And all who were on the spot, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who had come from various nations, recognised each his own tongue, and marvelled that those unlearned and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men had on the sudden learned not one or two tongues, but the tongues of all nations whatsoever. There, then, where all tongues sounded, there was it betokened that all tongues should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. But these men, who much <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and therefore refuse to communicate with the city which killed Christ, so <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Christ as to affirm that He is left to two tongues, the Latin and the Punic, <em>i.e.</em> African. Christ possess only two tongues! For there are but these two tongues on the side of Donatus, more they have not. Let us awake, my brethren, let us rather see the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and let us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the things spoken before concerning Him, and let us see fulfilled the things spoken before in the Psalm: <q>There are neither speeches nor discourses,  but their voices are heard among them.</q>  And lest haply the case be so that the tongues themselves came to one place, and not rather that the gift of Christ came to all tongues, hear what follows: <q>Into all the earth is their sound gone out, and unto the ends of the world their words.</q> Wherefore this? Because <q>in the sun has He set His tabernacle,</q> <em>i.e.</em>, in the open light. His tabernacle, His flesh: His tabernacle, His Church: <q>in the sun</q> it is set; not in the night, but in the day. But why do those not acknowledge it? Return to the lesson at the place where it ended yesterday, and see why they do not acknowledge it: <q>He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother, walks in darkness, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not whither he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</q> For us then, let us see what follows, and not be in darkness. How shall we not be in darkness? If we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brethren. How is it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brotherhood? By this, that we do not rend unity, that we hold fast charity.</p>

<p>4. <q>I write unto you, little children, because your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you through His name.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172084"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:12</a></span> Therefore, <q>little children,</q>  because in forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> you have your birth. But through whose name are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven? Through Augustine's? No, therefore neither through the name of Donatus. Be it your concern to see who is Augustine, or who Donatus: no, not through the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, not through the name of Peter. For to them that divided unto themselves the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and out of unity essayed to make parties, the mother charity in the apostle travailing in birth with her little ones, exposes her own bowels, with words does as it were rend her breasts, bewails her children whom she sees borne out dead, recalls unto the one Name them that would needs make them many names, repels them from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of her that Christ may be loved, and says, <q>Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> crucified for you? Or were you <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172086"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> What says he? <q>I would not that you be mine, that so you may be with me: be with me; all we are His who died for us, who was crucified for us</q>: whence here also it is said, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you through His name,</q> not through the name of any man.</p>

<p>5. <q>I write unto you, fathers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172087"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:13</a></span> Why first sons? <q>Because your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you through His name,</q> and you are regenerated into a new life, therefore sons. Why fathers? <q>Because you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him that is from the beginning:</q> for the beginning has relation unto fatherhood. Christ new in flesh, but ancient in Godhead. How ancient think we? How many years old? Think we, of greater age  than His mother? Assuredly of greater age than His mother, for <q>all things were made by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172089"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> If all things, then did the Ancient make the very mother of whom the New should be born. Was He, think we, before His mother only? Yea, and before His mother's ancestors is His antiquity. The ancestor of His mother was <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>; and the Lord says, <q>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> I am.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172090"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse58">John&nbsp;8:58</a></span> Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, say we? The heaven and earth, ere man was, were made. Before these was the Lord, nay rather also is. For right well He says, not, Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> I was, but, <q>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> I Am .</q> For that of which one says, <q>was,</q> is not; and that of which one says, <q>will be,</q> is not yet: He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not other than to be. As <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <q>to be:</q> <q>was,</q> and <q>will be,</q> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not. It is one day there, but a day that is for ever and ever. That day yesterday and tomorrow do not set in the midst between them: for when the 'yesterday' is ended, the 'today' begins, to be finished by the coming 'tomorrow.' That one day there is a day without darkness, without night, without spaces, without measure, without hours. Call it what you will: if you will, it is a day; if you will, a year; if you will, years. For it is said of this same, <q>And your years shall not fail.</q>  But when is it called a day? When it is said to the Lord, <q>Today have I begotten You.</q>  From the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Father begotten, from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> begotten, in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> begotten: with no beginning, no bound, no space of breadth; because He is what is, because Himself is <q>He that Is.</q> This His name He told to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>You shall say unto them, He that Is has sent me unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172093"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> Why speak then of <q>before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a></q>?

<p>8. All these things, my brethren,&mdash; <q>because we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> That which is from the beginning, because we are strong, because we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>&mdash; do all these, while they in a manner commend  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, not commend charity?

The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> confessed the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and said, <q>What have we to do with You?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172105"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;8:29</a></span> and were repulsed.

But how can we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world? He prepares us therefore to be inhabited by charity.  There are two loves: of the world, and of God: if the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world inhabit, there is no way for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God to enter in: let the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world make way, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God inhabit; let the better have place. You <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> the world: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the world: when you have emptied your heart of earthly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, you shall drink in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Divine: and thenceforth begins charity to inhabit you, from which can nothing of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> proceed. Hear therefore his words, how he goes to work in the manner of one that makes a clearance. He comes upon the hearts of men as a field that he would occupy: but in what state does he find it? If he finds a wood, he roots it up; if he finds the field cleared, he plants it. He would plant a tree there, charity. And what is the wood he would root up? Love of the world. Hear him, the rooter up of the wood! <q>Love not the world,</q> (for this comes next,) <q>neither the things that are in the world; if any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172108"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:15</a></span> </p>

<p>9. You have heard that <q>if any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him.</q> Let not any say in his heart that this is false, brethren: God says it; by the Apostle the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has spoken; nothing more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: <q>If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him.</q> Would you have the Father's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that you may be joint-heir with the Son? Love not the world. Shut out the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world, that you may be filled with  the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You are a vessel; but as yet you are full. Pour out what you have, that you may receive what you have not. Certainly,  our brethren are now born again of water and of the Spirit: we also some years ago were born again of water and of the Spirit. Good is it for us that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the world, lest the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> remain in us unto damnation, not as means of strengthening  unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. That which strengthens unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is, to have the root of charity, to have the <q>power of godliness,</q> not <q>the form</q> only. <span class="stiki" id="note172112"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:5</a></span> Good is the form, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> the form: but what avails the form, if it hold not the root? The branch that is cut off, is it not cast into the fire? Have the form, but in the root. But in what way are you rooted so that you be not rooted up? By holding charity, as says the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, <q>rooted and grounded in charity.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172113"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> How shall charity be rooted there, amid the overgrown wilderness of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world? Make clear riddance of the woods. A mighty seed you are about to put in: let there not be that in the field which shall choke the seed. These are the uprooting words which he has said: <q>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172114"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:15</a></span> </p>

<p>10. <q>For all that is in the world, is  the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>  of life,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172117"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:16-17</a></span> three things he has said, which  are not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but are of the world. And the world passes away, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof: but he that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides for ever, even as He abides for ever.  Why am I not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what God made? What will you? Whether will you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the things of time, and pass away with time; or not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, and live to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> with God? The river of temporal things hurries one along: but like a tree sprung up beside the river is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.  He assumed flesh, died, rose again, ascended into heaven. It was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to plant Himself, in a manner, beside the river of the things of time. Are you rushing down the stream to the headlong deep? Hold fast the tree. Is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world whirling you on? Hold fast Christ. For you He became temporal, that you might become <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; because He also in such sort became temporal, that He remained still <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Something was added to Him from time, not anything went from His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. But you were born temporal, and by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wast made temporal: you were made temporal by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, He was made temporal by mercy in remitting <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. How great the difference, when two are in a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, between the criminal and him that visits him! For upon a time a person comes to his friend and enters in to visit him, and both seem to be in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>; but they differ by a wide distinction. The one, his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> presses down: the other, humanity has brought there. So in this our mortal state, we were held fast by our guiltiness, He in mercy came down: He entered in unto the captive, a Redeemer not an oppressor. The Lord for us shed His blood, redeemed us, changed our hope. As yet we bear the mortality of the flesh, and take the future <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> upon trust: and on the sea we are tossed by the waves, but we have the anchor of hope already fixed upon the land.</p>

<p>11. But let us <q>not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, neither the things that are in the world. For the things that are in the world, are the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life.</q> These three are they: lest haply any man say, <q>The things that are in the world, God made: <em> i.e.</em> heaven and earth, the sea: the sun, the moon, the stars, all the garniture of the heavens. What is the garniture of the sea? All creeping things. What of the earth? animals, trees, flying creatures. These are 'in the world,' God made them. Why then am I not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what God has made?</q> Let the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> be in you, that you may see that all these things are good: but woe to you if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the things made, and forsake the Maker of them! Fair are they to you: but how much fairer He that formed them! Mark well, beloved. For by similitudes you may be instructed: lest <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> steal upon you, saying what he is wont to say, Take your enjoyment in the creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherefore made He those things but for your enjoyment? And men drink themselves drunken, and perish, and forget their own Creator: while not temperately but lustfully they use the things created, the Creator is despised. Of such says the apostle: <q>They worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, Who is blessed for ever.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172121"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;1:25</a></span> God does not forbid you to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>  these things, howbeit, not to  set your affections upon them for blessedness, but to approve and praise them to this end, that you may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your Creator. In the same manner, my brethren, as if a bridegroom should make a ring for his bride, and she having received the ring, should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it more than she loves the bridegroom who made the ring for her: would not her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be found guilty of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in the very gift of the bridegroom, albeit she did but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what the bridegroom gave her? By all means let her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what the bridegroom gave: yet should she say, <q>This ring is enough for me, I do not wish to see his face now:</q> what sort of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> would she be? Who would not detest such folly? Who not pronounce her guilty of an adulterous mind? You love gold in place of the man, lovest a ring in place of the bridegroom: if this be in you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a ring in place of your bridegroom, and hast no wish to see your bridegroom; that he has given you an earnest, serves not to pledge you to him, but to turn away your heart from him! For this the bridegroom gives earnest, that in his earnest he may himself be loved. Well then, God gave you all these things: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him that made them. There is more that He would fain give you, that is, His very Self that made these things. But if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> these&mdash; what though God made them&mdash; and neglect the Creator and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world; shall not your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> be accounted adulterous? </p> 

<p>12. For <q>the world</q> is the appellation given not only to this fabric which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made heaven and earth, the sea, things visible and invisible: but the inhabitants of the world are called the world, just as we call a <q>house</q> both the walls and them that inhabit therein. And sometimes we praise a house, and find fault with the inhabitants. For we say, A good house; because it is marbled and beautifully  ceiled: and in another sense we say, A good house: no man there suffers wrong, no acts of plunder, no acts of oppression, are done there. Now we praise not the building, but those who dwell within the building: yet we call it <q>house,</q> both this and that. For all lovers of the world, because by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they inhabit the world, just as those inhabit heaven, whose heart is on high while in the flesh they walk on earth: I say then, all lovers of the world are called the world. The same have only these three things, <q><a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of life.</q> For they <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> to eat, drink, cohabit: to use these pleasures. Not surely, that there is no allowed measure in these things, or that when it is said, Love not these things, it means that you are not to eat, or not to drink, or not to beget children? This is not the thing said. Only, let there be measure, because of the Creator, that these things may not bind you by your loving of them: lest you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that for enjoyment, which you ought to have for use. But you are not put to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> except when two things are propounded to you, this or that: Will you righteousness or gains? I have not wherewithal to live, have not wherewithal to eat, have not wherewithal to drink. But what if you can not have these but by iniquity? Is it not better to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that which you lose not, than to lose yourself by iniquity? You see the gain of gold, the loss of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you see not. This then, says he to us, is <q>the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh,</q> <em>i.e.</em> the lusting after those things which pertain to the flesh, such as food, and carnal cohabitation, and all other such like.</p>

<p>13. <q>And the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes:</q> by <q>the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes,</q> he means all curiosity. Now how wide is the scope of curiosity! This it is that works in spectacles, in theatres, in <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in magical arts, in dealings  with darkness: none other than curiosity. Sometimes it tempts even the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that they wish as it were to work a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, to tempt God whether He will hear their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in working of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; it is curiosity: this is <q><a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes;</q> it <q>is not of the Father.</q> If God has given the power, do the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, for He has put it in your way to do it: for think not that those who have not done <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> shall not pertain to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were rejoicing that the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> were subject to them, what said the Lord to them? <q>Rejoice not in this, but <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> because your names are written in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172127"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;10:20</a></span> In that would He have the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, wherein you also <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. Woe to you <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> if your name be not written in heaven! Is it woe to you if you raise not the dead? Is it woe to you if you walk not on the sea? Is it woe to you if you cast not out <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? If you have received power to do them, use it humbly, not proudly. For even of certain <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> the Lord has said that <q>they shall do signs and prodigies.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172128"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;24:24</a></span> Therefore let there be no <q>ambition of the world:</q> <em>Ambitio s&aelig;culi</em>, is Pride. The man wishes to make much of himself in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>: he thinks himself great, whether because of riches, or because of some power.</p>

<p>14. These three there are, and you can find nothing whereby <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> cupidity can be tempted, but either by the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, or the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, or the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life. By these three was the Lord tempted of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note172129"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;4:1-10</a></span> By the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh He was tempted when it was said to Him, <q>If you be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, speak to these stones that they become bread,</q> when He hungered after His fast. But in what way repelled He the tempter, and taught his soldier how to fight? Mark what He said to him: <q>Not by bread alone does man live, but by every word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> He was tempted also by the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes concerning a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, when he said to Him, <q>Cast yourself down: for it is written, He shall give his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> charge concerning you: and in their hands they shall bear you up, lest at any time you dash your foot against a stone.</q> He resisted the tempter, for to do the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, would only have been to seem either to have yielded, or to have done it from curiosity; for He wrought when He would, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, howbeit as healing the weak. For if He had done it then, He might have been thought to wish only to do a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. But lest men should think this, mark what He answered; and when the like <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> shall happen to you, say also the same: <q>Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>; for it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God:</q> that is, if I do this I shall tempt God. He said what He would have you to say. When the enemy suggests to you, <q>What sort of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, what sort of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, are you? As yet have you done one <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, or by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have the dead been raised, or have you healed the fevered? If you were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> of any moment, you would do some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>:</q> answer and say: <q>It is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God:</q> therefore I will not tempt <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as if I should belong to God if I do a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and not belong if I do none: and what becomes then of His words, <q>Rejoice, because your names are written in heaven</q>? By <q><a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life</q> how was the Lord tempted? When he carried Him up to an high place, and said to Him, <q>All these will I give you, if you will fall down and worship me.</q> By the loftiness of an earthly kingdom he wished to tempt the King of all worlds: but the Lord who made heaven and earth trod the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> under foot. What great matter for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to be conquered by the Lord?
