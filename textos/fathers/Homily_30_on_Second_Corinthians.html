<h1>Homily 30 on Second Corinthians</h1>

<h2>2 Corinthians 13:10</h2>

<p>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for casting down.</p>

<p>He was sensible he had spoken more vehemently than his wont, and especially towards the end of the Epistle. For he said before, <q>Now I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ; I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> towards you: Yea, I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present, with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some which count of us as if we walked according to the flesh;</q> <span class="stiki">Chap. 10:1, 2</span> and, <q>being in readiness to avenge all disobedience when your <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> shall be fulfilled:</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse6">2 Corinthians 10:6</a></span> and, <q>I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as you would not;</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse20">2 Corinthians 12:20</a></span> and again, <q>lest when I come my God should <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> me before you, and that I should mourn many of them which have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> heretofore, and repented not of the lasciviousness and uncleanness which they committed:</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 12:21</a></span> and afterwards, <q>I told you before and foretell you, as if I were present the second time, and being absent now I write, that, if I come again, I will not spare; seeing that you seek a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that speaks in me.</q> <span class="stiki">Chap. 13:2, 3</span> Since then he had said these things and more besides, terrifying, shaming, reproaching, lashing them, he says, in excuse for all, <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I write these things while absent, that I may not when present deal sharply.</q> For I am desirous the sharpness should lie in my letters and not in my <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. I wish my threats to be vehement, that they may continue threats and never go forth into action. Again even in this his apology he makes what he says more terrible, showing that it is not himself who is to punish, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for he added, <q>according to the authority which the Lord gave me;</q> and again, to show that he desires not to use his power to their punishment, he added, <q>not for casting down, but for building up.</q> And he hinted indeed this now, as I said, but he left it to them to draw the conclusion that if they should continue unamended, even this again is building up, to punish those that are of such a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. For so it is, and he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it and showed it by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 13:11</h2>

<p><q>For the rest,  brethren, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, be perfected, be comforted, be of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, live in peace, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace shall be with you.</q></p>

<p>What means, <q>for the rest, brethren, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>?</q> You have pained, terrified, thrown them into an agony, made them to tremble and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and how do you bid them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>? 'Why, for this very reason I bid them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. For,' he says, 'if what is your part follow' upon mine, there will be nothing to prevent that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For all my part has been done; I have suffered long, I have delayed, I have forborne to cut off, I have besought, I have advised, I have alarmed, I have threatened, so as by every means to gather you in unto the fruit of repentance. And now it behooves that your part be done, and so your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> will be unfading.'</p>

<p><q>Be perfected.</q> What is, <q>be perfected?</q> 'Be complete, fill up what is deficient.'</p>

<p><q>Be comforted.</q> For, since their trials were numerous, and their perils great, he says, '<q>be comforted,</q> both by one another, and by us, and by your change unto the better. For if you should have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and become complete, nothing is wanting unto your cheerfulness and comfort. For nothing does so produce comfort as a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, yea, though innumerable trials surround.'</p>

<p><q>Be of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, live in peace.</q> The request he made in the former Epistle also, at the opening. For it is possible to be of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and yet not to live in peace, [for instance], when people agree in doctrine, but in their dealings with each other are at variance. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> requires both.</p>

<p><q>And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace shall be with you.</q> For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> he not only recommends and advises, but also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>. For either he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for this, or else foretells what shall happen; or rather, both. 'For if you do these things,' he says, 'for instance, if you be <q>of one mind</q> and <q>live in peace,</q> God also will be with you, for He is <q>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and of peace,</q> and in these things He delights, He rejoices. Hence shall peace also be yours from His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; hence shall every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> be removed. This saved the world, this ended the long <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, this blended together heaven and earth, this made men <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. This then let us also imitate, for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the mother of countless <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. By this we were saved, by this all those unspeakable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things [come] to us.'</p>

<p>2. Then to lead them on unto it, he says,</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 13:12</h2>

<p><q>Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>.</q></p>

<p>What is <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>?</q> not hollow,  not treacherous, like the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> which Judas gave to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For therefore is the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> given, that it may be fuel unto <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that it may kindle the disposition, that we may so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> each other, as brothers brothers, as children <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> children; yea, rather even far more. For those things are a disposition implanted by nature, but these by spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Thus our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> bound unto each other. And therefore when we return after an absence we <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> each other, our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> hastening unto mutual intercourse. For this is that member which most of all declares to us the workings of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But about this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> somewhat else may yet be said. To what effect? We are the temple of Christ; we <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> then the porch and entrance of the temple when we <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> each other. See ye not how many <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> even the porch of this temple, some stooping down, others grasping it with their hand, and putting their hand to their mouth. And through these gates and doors Christ both had entered into us, and does enter, whenever we communicate. You who partake of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> understand what I say. For it is in no common manner that our lips are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, when they receive the Lord's Body. It is for this reason chiefly that we here <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. Let them give ear who speak filthy things, who utter railing, and let them shudder to think what that mouth is they dishonor; let those give ear who <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> obscenely. Hear what things God has proclaimed by your mouth, and keep it undefiled. He has discoursed of the life to come, of the resurrection, of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, that death is not death, of those other innumerable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. For he that is about to be initiated comes to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> mouth as it were an oracle, to hear things full of awe. For he lost his life even from his forefathers, and comes to seek it again, and to ask how he may haply find and get it back. Then God announces to him how it may be found, and that mouth becomes more awful than the very mercy-seat. For that mercy-seat never sent forth a voice like this, but spoke much of lesser things, of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and such peace as is here below: but this speaks all about heaven and the life to come, and things new and that pass understanding. And having said,</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 13:13</h2>

<p><q>Salute one another with an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>,</q> he added, <q>All the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> salute you.</q></p>

<p>By this also giving them good hopes. He has added this in the place of the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, knitting them together by the salutation, for the words also proceed from the same mouth from which the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. Do you see how he brings them all together, both those who are widely separated in the body and those who are near, these by the <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> and those by the written message?</p>

<h2>2 Corinthians 13:14</h2>

<p>3. <q>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,  <q>and the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be with you all.</q> After having united them to one other by the salutations and the kisses, he again closes his speech with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, with much carefulness uniting them unto God also. Where now are they who say that because the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not inserted in the beginnings of the Epistles, He is not of the same substance? For, behold, he has now enumerated Him with the Father and Son. And besides this, one may remark, that when writing to the Colossians and saying, <q>Grace to you, and peace from God our Father,</q> he was silent of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and added not, as in all his Epistles, and from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.  Is then the Son not of the same substance either, because of this? Nay, these reasonings are of extreme folly. For this very thing especially shows Him to be of the same substance, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> uses the expression [or not] indifferently. And that what is here said is no conjecture, hear how he mentions Son and Spirit, and is quite silent of the Father. For, writing to the Corinthians, he says, <q>But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> of our God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 6:11</a></span> What then, tell me? Were these not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into the Father? Then assuredly they were neither washed nor sanctified. But did they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them? Doubtless then just as also they did <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. How then did he not say, 'You are washed in the name of the Father.' Because it was indifferent in his view, at one time to make mention of this, at another of that Person; and you may observe this custom in many places of the Epistles. For writing to the Romans he says, <q>I beseech you therefore by the mercies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a></span> although those mercies are of the Son; and, <q>I beseech you by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse30">Romans 15:30</a></span> although <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is of the Father. Wherefore then mentioned he not the Son in <q>the mercies,</q> nor the Father in <q>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>?</q> Because as being things plain and admitted, he was silent about them. Moreover, he will be found again, to put the gifts also themselves transposedly.  For having said here, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;</q> he in another place speaks of <q>the communion of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> and of <q>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Spirit.</q> For, <q>I beseech you,</q> he says, <q>by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse30">Romans 15:30</a></span> And in his Epistle to the Corinthians, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is faithful, by Whom you were called into the communion of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 1:9</a></span> Thus the things of the Trinity are undivided: and whereas the communion is of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, it has been found of the Son; and whereas the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, it is also of the Father and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; for [we read], <q>Grace be to you from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</q> And in another place, having enumerated many forms of it, he added, <q>But all these works the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally as He will.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 12:11</a></span> And I say these things, not confounding  the Persons, (away with the thought!) but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> both the individuality and distinctness  of These, and the Unity of the Substance.</p>

<p>4. Let us then continue both to hold these doctrines in their strictness, and to draw to us the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For before indeed He loved us when hating Him, and reconciled us who were His enemies; but henceforth He wishes to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us as loving Him. Let us then continue to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, so that we may be also loved by Him. For if when beloved by powerful men we are formidable to all, much more when [beloved] by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And should it be needful to give <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, or body, or even life itself for this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, let us not grudge them. For it is not enough to say in words that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but we ought to give also the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; for neither did He show <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by words only, but by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> also. Do thou then also show this by your <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and do those things which please Him, for so shall you yourself reap again the advantage. For He needs nothing that we have to bestow, and this is also a special <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, when one who needs nothing and is not in any necessity, does all for the sake of being loved by us. &nbsp;Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, <q>For what does the Lord God require of you, but to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, and that you should be ready to walk after Him?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu010.htm#verse12">Deuteronomy 10:12</a></span> So that when He bids you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, He then most of all shows that He loves you. For nothing does so secure our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> as to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. See then, how that all His commandments even tend together to our repose and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and good report. For when he says, <q>Blessed are the merciful, blessed are the pure in heart, blessed are the meek, blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the peacemakers;</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew 5:3-9</a></span> He Himself indeed reaps no advantage from these, but he enjoins them for our adorning and attuning; and when He says, <q>I was an hungred,</q> it is not as needing that ministry from us, but as exciting you to humanity. For He was well able even without you to feed the poor man; but as bestowing upon you an exceeding treasure, he laid these commands upon you. For if the sun, which is but a creature, needs not our eyes; for he abides in his own proper brightness, even though none should look upon him, and we it is who are the gainers when we enjoy his beams; much more is this so with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But that you may learn this in yet another way; how great will you have the distance to be between God and us? As great as between gnats and us, or much greater? Quite plainly it is much greater, yea, <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. If then we vainglorious creatures need not service nor <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from gnats, much rather the Divine Nature [none from us], seeing It is impassible and needing nothing. The measure of that which He enjoys by us is but the greatness of our benefit, and the delight He takes in our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For this reason He also oftentimes relinquishes His own, and seeks yours. <q>For if any,</q> he says, have a wife that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 7:12</a></span> and, <q>He that puts away his wife, saving for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fornication, causes her to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q> Do you see what unspeakable goodness? 'If a wife be a harlot,' He says, 'I do not compel the husband to live with her; and if she be an unbeliever, I do not forbid him.' Again, 'if you be grieved against any one, I command him that has grieved you to leave My gift and to run to you.' For He says, <q>If you are offering your gift, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave your gift before the altar, and go your way, first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse23">Matthew 5:23-24</a></span> And what says the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of him that had devoured his all? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse24">Matthew 18:24, etc.</a></span> Does it not show this? For when he had eaten up those ten thousand talents, He had mercy on him, and let him go; but when he demanded of his fellowservant an hundred pence, he both called him <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and delivered him over to the punishment. So great account does He make of your ease. The barbarian was about to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the wife of the just man, and He says, <q>I spared you from sinning against me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen020.htm#verse6">Genesis 20:6</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the Apostles, and He says to him, <q>Why do you persecute Me?</q> Others are hungry, and He Himself says He is an hungred, and wanders about naked and a stranger, wishing to shame you, and so to force you into the way of almsgiving.</p>

<p>Reflecting then upon the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, how great He has shown in all things, and still shows it to be, both having vouchsafed to make Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, (which is the greatest crown of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and light to the understanding and instruction in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>,) and to lay down <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> for the best mode of life, and having done all things for our sakes, having given His Son, and promised a kingdom, and invited us to those unspeakable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and prepared for us a most blessed life, let us do and say every thing so as both to appear worthy of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and to obtain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come; whereunto may we all attain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards men of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; with Whom to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
