<h1>Homily 32 on Romans</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Romans XVI. 17, 18</p>

<p><q>Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned, and avoid them. For they that are such serve not <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.</q></p>

<p>Again an exhortation, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> after the exhortation. For after telling them to <q>mark them which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>  divisions,</q> and not to listen to them, he proceeds, <q>And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace shall bruise <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> under your feet shortly:</q> and, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of our Lord be with you.</q> And notice how gently too he exhorts them: doing it not in the character of a counsellor, but that of a servant, and with much respect. For he calls them brethren, and supplicates them likewise. For, <q>I beseech you, brethren,</q> (he says). Then he also puts them on the defensive by showing the deceitfulness of those who abused them. For as though they were not at once to be discerned, he says, <q>I beseech you to mark,</q> that is, to be exceedingly particular about, and to get acquainted with, and to search out thoroughly&mdash; whom, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>? Why, <q>those that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> divisions and offenses, contrary to the doctrine which you have learned.</q>  For this is, if anything the subversion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the being in divisions. This is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> weapon, this turns all things upside-down. For so long as the body is joined into one, he has no power to get an entrance, but it is from division that the offense comes. And whence is division? From opinions contrary to the teaching of the Apostles. And whence come opinions of this sort? From men's being slaves to the belly, and the other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For <q>such,</q> he says, <q>serve not the Lord, but their own belly.</q> And so there would be no offense, there would be no division, unless some opinion were thought of contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles. And this he here points out by saying, <q>contrary to the doctrine.</q> And he does not say which we have taught, but <q>which you have learned,</q> so anticipating them, and showing that they were persuaded of and had heard them and received them. And what are we to do to those who make mischief in this way? He does not say have a meeting and come to blows, but <q>avoid them.</q> For if it was from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that they did this, one ought to set them right. But if they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> willingly, spring away from them. And in another place too he says this. For he says, <q>Withdraw from every brother that walks disorderly</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse6">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a></span>: and in speaking to Timothy about the coppersmith, he gives him the like advice, and says, <q>Of whom also beware.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse15">2 Timothy 4:15</a></span> Then also to lash (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03C9;&#x03BC;&#x1FF3;&#x03B4;&#x1F65;&#x03BD;</span>) those who dare to do such things, he mentions also the reason of their devising this division. <q>For they that are such,</q> he says, <q>serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly.</q> And this he said too when he wrote to the Philippians, <q>Whose god is their belly.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians 3:19</a></span> But here he appears to me to intimate those of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, whom he ever uses particularly to find fault with as gluttonous. For in writing to Titus too, he said of them, <q>Evil beasts, slow bellies.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse12">Titus 1:12</a>, see <a href="../bible/tit005.htm#verse10">5:10</a></span> And Christ also blames them on this head: <q>You devour <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows'</a> houses</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse14">Matthew 23:14</a></span>, He says. And the Prophets accuse them of things of the kind. For, <q>My beloved,</q> He says, <q>has waxen fat and gross, and has kicked</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 32:15</a></span>. Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> exhorted them, and said, <q>When you have eaten and drunken and are full, remember the Lord your God.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->ib. 6:11, 12.) And in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, they who say to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>What sign do you show unto us?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse30">John 6:30</a></span> pass over everything else, and remember the manna. So do they everywhere appear to be possessed with this affection. How then do you come not to be ashamed at having slaves of the belly for your teachers, when you are a brother of Christ? Now the ground of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is this, but the mode of attack is again a different disorder, viz. flattery. For it is by <q>fair speeches,</q> he says, <q>that they deceive the hearts of the simple.</q> For their attention reaches only to words; but their meaning is not such, for it is full of fraud. And he does not say that they deceive you, but <q>the hearts of the simple.</q> And even with this he was not satisfied, but with a view to making this statement less grating, he says,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse19">Ver. 19</a>. <q>For your <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> has come abroad unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q></p>

<p>This he does, not to leave them free to be shameless, but to win them beforehand with encomiums, and the number of his witnesses, to arrest their attention. For neither is it I alone that am the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, but the whole world. And he does not say for your understanding, but, <q>your <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>:</q> that is, their compliance, which was evidence of much meekness in them. <q>I am glad therefore on your behalf.</q> And this is no small encomium too. Then, after the praise, admonition. For lest, after liberating them from any charges against them, he should make them the more listless, as not being observed; he gives them another hint in the words,</p>

<p><q>I would have you wise unto that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and simple concerning <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q></p>

<p>You see then how he attacks them again, and that without their suspecting it. For this looks like intimating that some of them were apt to be led astray.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse20">Ver. 20</a>. <q>And the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace shall bruise <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> under your feet shortly.</q></p>

<p>For since he had spoken of those who <q>caused divisions and offenses among them,</q> he has mentioned <q>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace</q> also, that they might feel hopeful about the riddance of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For he that rejoices in this (i.e., peace) will put an end to that which makes havoc of it. And he does not say, will subject, but <q>will bruise</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis 3:19</a></span>, which is a stronger expression. And not those people only, but also him who was the general over them herein, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. And not <q>will bruise</q> merely, but <q>under your feet,</q> so that they may obtain the victory themselves, and become noble by the trophy. And the time again is made a ground of comfort. For he adds, <q>shortly.</q> And this was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> as well at once. <q>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> be with you.</q></p>

<p>That greatest weapon; that impregnable wall; that tower unshaken! For he reminds them of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that he may give them the more alacrity. Because if you have been freed from the ills more grievous by far, and freed by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> only, much more will you be freed from the lesser, now you have become friends too, and contribute your own share likewise. You see how he neither puts <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> without works, nor works without <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For after giving them credit for their <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, than he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>; to show that we need both, our own part as well as God's part, if we are to be duly saved. For it was not before only, but now too, even though we be great and in high esteem, we need <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from Him.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse21">Ver. 21</a>. <q>Timotheus my work-fellow salutes you.</q></p>

<p>Observe the customary encomiums again. <q>And Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen.</q></p>

<p>This Jason Luke also mentions, and sets before us his manliness also, when he says, that <q>they drew</q> him <q>to the rulers of the city, crying,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse5">Acts 17:5</a></span> And it is likely that the others too were men of note. For he does not mention relations barely, unless they were also like him in religiousness.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse22">Ver. 22</a>. <q>I Tertius, who wrote this Epistle, salute you.</q></p>

<p>This too is no small encomium, to be <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> amanuensis. Still it is not to pass encomiums on himself that he says this, but that he might attach a warm <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to him on their part, for this ministration.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse23">Ver. 23</a>. <q>Gaius mine host (<span class="greek">&#x03BE;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>), and of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, salutes you.</q></p>

<p>See what a crown he has framed for him by bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to such great hospitality in him, and brought in the entire Church into this man's house! For by the word <span class="greek">&#x03BE;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, used here, he means a host, not a guest. But when you hear that he was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> host, do not admire him for his munificence only, but also for his strictness of life. For except he were worthy of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> excellency, he would never have lodged there, since he, who took pains to go beyond  many of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> commands, would never have trespassed against that law, which bids us be very particular about who receive us, and about lodging with <q>worthy</q> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse11">Matthew 10:11</a></span> <q>Erastus, the chamberlain of the city, salutes you, and Quartus a brother.</q> There is a purpose in his adding <q>the chamberlain of the city,</q> for as he wrote to the Philippians, <q>They of C&aelig;sar's household salute you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse22">Philippians 4:22</a></span>, that he might show that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> had taken a hold upon great folk, so here too he mentions the title with a view to the same object, and to show that, to the man who gives heed, neither riches are a hindrance, nor the cares of government, nor anything else of the kind.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse24">Ver. 24</a>. <q>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> be with you all. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> </p>

<p>See what we ought to begin and to end with everywhere! For in this he laid the foundation of the Epistle, and in this he puts on the roof, at once <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for the mother of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things for them, and calling the whole of his loving-kindness to their mind. For this is the best <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of a generous teacher, to benefit his learners not by word only, but likewise by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, for which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also one said, <q>But let us give ourselves continually to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and to the ministry of the word.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse4">Acts 6:4</a></span></p>

<p>Who is there then to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> over us, since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has departed? These who  are the imitators of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Only let us yield ourselves worthy of such intercession (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>), that it may not be that we hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> voice here only, but that hereafter, when we are departed, we may be counted worthy to see the wrestler of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  Or rather, if we hear him here, we shall certainly see him hereafter, if not as standing near him, yet see him we certainly shall, glistening near the Throne of the king.  Where the Cherubim sing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, where the Seraphim are flying, there shall we see <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, with Peter, and as a chief  and leader of the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of the Saints, and shall enjoy his generous <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For if when here he loved men so, that when he had the choice of departing and being with Christ, he chose to be here, much more will he there display a warmer affection. I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Rome even for this, although indeed one has other grounds for praising it, both for its greatness, and its antiquity, and its beauty, and its populousness, and for its power, and its <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and for its successes in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. But I let all this pass, and esteem it blessed on this account, that both in his lifetime he wrote to them, and loved them so, and talked with them whiles he was with us, and brought his life to a close there.  Wherefore the city is more notable upon this ground, than upon all others together. And as a body great and strong, it has as two glistening eyes the bodies of these Saints. Not so bright is the heaven, when the sun sends forth his rays, as is the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, sending out these two lights into all parts of the world. From thence will <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> be caught up, from thence Peter. Just bethink you, and shudder (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03BE;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;</span>) at the thought of what a sight Rome will see, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> arises suddenly from that deposit, together with Peter, and is lifted up to meet the Lord. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse17">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a></span> What a rose will Rome send up to Christ! <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa035.htm#verse1">Isaiah 35:1</a></span> what two crowns will the city have about it! What golden chains will she be girded with! What fountains possess! Therefore I admire the city, not for the much gold, not for the columns, not for the other display there, but for these pillars of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse38">1 Corinthians 15:38</a></span> Would that it were now given me to throw myself round (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C7;&#x03C5;&#x03B8;&#x1F25;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) the body of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and be riveted to the tomb, and to see the dust of that body that <q>filled up that which was lacking</q> after <q>Christ</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse24">Colossians 1:24</a></span>, that bore <q>the marks</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x1F77;&#x03B3;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;</span>,) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse17">Galatians 6:17</a></span> that sowed the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> everywhere yea, the dust of that body through which he ran to and fro everywhere! The dust of that body through which Christ spoke, and the Light shone forth more brilliant than any lightning, and the voice started out, more awful than any thunder to the devils! Through which he uttered that blessed voice, saying, <q>I could wish that myself were accursed, for my brethren</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse3">Romans 9:3</a></span>, through which he spoke <q>before kings, and was not ashamed!</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse46">Psalm 119:46</a></span> through which we come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> through which also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> Master! Not so awful to us is the thunder, as was that voice to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>! For if they shuddered at his clothes <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse12">Acts 19:12</a></span>, much more did they at his voice. This led them away captive, this cleansed out the world, this put a stop to diseases, cast out <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, lifted the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on high, had Christ riding  upon it, and everywhere went about with Him; and what the Cherubim were, this was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> voice, for as He was seated upon those Powers, so was He upon <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> tongue. For it had become worthy of receiving Christ, by speaking those things only which were acceptable to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and flying as the Seraphim to height unspeakable! For what more lofty than that voice which says, <q>For I am persuaded that neither Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is in Christ Jesus?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse38">Romans 8:38-39</a></span> What pinions does not this discourse seem to you to have? What eyes? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze010.htm#verse12">Ezekiel 10:12</a></span> It was owing to this that he said, <q>for we are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his devices.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse11">2 Corinthians 2:11</a></span> Owing to this did the devils flee not only at hearing him speak, but even at seeing his garments. This is the mouth, the dust whereof I would fain see, through which Christ spoke the great and secret things, and greater than in His own person, (for as He wrought, so He also spoke greater things by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, ) through which the Spirit gave those wondrous oracles to the world! For what good thing did not that mouth effect? Devils it drove out, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it loosed, tyrants it muzzled, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers'</a> mouths it stopped, the world it brought over to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, savages it persuaded to learn wisdom, all the whole order of the earth it altered. Things in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> too it disposed what way it listed <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 5:3-4</a></span>, binding whom it would, and loosing in the other world, <q>according unto the power given unto it.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 13:10</a></span> Nor is it that mouth only, but the heart too would fain see the dust of, which a man would not do wrong to call the heart of the world, and a fountain of countless blessings, and a beginning, and element of our life. For the spirit of life was furnished out of it all, and was distributed through the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not as being sent forth by arteries, but by a free choice of good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. This heart was so large, as to take in entire cities, and peoples, and nations. <q>For my heart</q> he says, <q>is enlarged.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse11">2 Corinthians 6:11</a></span> Yet even a heart thus large, did this very charity that enlarged it many a time straiten and oppress. For he says, <q>Out of much affliction (<span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03C8;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>) and anguish (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C7;&#x1F25;&#x03C2;</span>) of heart I wrote unto you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 2:4</a></span> I were desirous to see that heart even after its dissolution, which burned at each one that was lost, which travailed a second time with the children that had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> abortions <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse19">Galatians 4:19</a></span>, which saw <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  (<q>for the pure in heart,</q> He says, <q>shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew 5:8</a></span> which became a Sacrifice, (<q>for a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a contrite heart,</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse17">Psalm 51:17</a></span> which was loftier than the heavens, which was wider than the world, which was brighter than the sun's beam, which was warmer than fire, which was stronger than adamant, which sent forth rivers, (<q>for rivers,</q> it says, <q>of living water shall flow out of his belly,</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse38">John 7:38</a></span> wherein was a fountain springing up, and watering, not the face of the earth, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whence not rivers only, but even fountains of  tears, issued day and night, which lived the new life, not this of ours, (for <q>I live,</q> he says, <q>yet not I, but Christ lives in me,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians 2:20</a></span> so <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> heart was His heart, and a tablet of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and a book of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>); which trembled for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, (for I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he says, lest by any means <q>I have bestowed labor upon you in vain; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse11">Galatians 4:11</a></span> lest as the serpent beguiled Eve; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse3">2 Corinthians 11:3</a></span> lest when I come I should find you not such as I would;</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse20">2 Corinthians 12:20</a></span> which both feared for itself, and was confiding too, (for I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he says, <q>lest by any means after having preached to others I myself should be a castaway,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 9:27</a></span> And, <q>I am persuaded that neither <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> nor powers shall be able to separate us;</q>) <span class="stiki">alluding to <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse3">Romans 9:3</a></span> which was counted worthy to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ as no other man loved Him: which despised death and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, yet was broken down by brothers' tears, (for he says, <q>what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse13">Acts 21:13</a></span> which was most enduring, and yet could not bear to be absent from the Thessalonians by the space of an hour! <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse17">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a>; 3:10</span> Fain would I see the dust of hands that were in a chain, through the imposition of which the Spirit was furnished, through which the divine writings were written, (for <q>behold how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand:</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse11"Galatians 6:11</a></span> and again, <q>The salutation of me <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> with my own hand,</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse21">1 Corinthians 16:21</a></span> of those hands at the sight of which the serpent <q>fell off into the fire.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse5">Acts 28:5</a></span> Fain would I see the dust of those eyes which were blinded <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a>, which recovered their sight again for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world; which even in the body were counted worthy to see Christ, which saw earthly things, yet saw them not, which saw the things which are not seen, which saw not sleep, which were watchful at midnight, which were not effected as eyes are.  I would also see the dust of those feet, which ran through the world and were not weary; which were bound in the stocks when the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> shook, which went through parts habitable or uninhabited, which walked on so many journeys. And why need I speak of single parts? Fain would I see the tomb, where the armor of righteousness is laid up, the armor of light, the limbs which now live, but which in life were made dead; and in all whereof Christ lived, which were crucified to the world, which were Christ's members, which were clad in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, were a temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> building, <q>bound in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse22">Acts 20:22</a></span> riveted to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which had the marks of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This body is a wall to that City, which is safer than all towers, and than thousands of battlements. And with it is that of Peter. For he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> him while alive. For he <q>went up to see Peter,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse18">Galatians 1:18</a></span> and therefore even when departed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> deigned to give him the same abode with him. Fain would I see the spiritual Lion. For as a lion breathing (Gr. sending,) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse15">Canticles 2:15</a></span> forth fire (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1F55;&#x03C1; &#x1F00;&#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03B5;&#x1F76;&#x03C2;</span>) upon the herds of foxes, so rushed he upon the clan of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and as the burst of some thunderbolt, was borne down into the host of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse32">Luke 13:32</a></span> For he did not even come to set the battle in array against him, since he feared so and trembled at him, as that if he saw his shadow, and heard his voice, he fled even at a distance. And so did he deliver over to him the fornicator, though at a distance, and again snatched him out of his hands <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2 Corinthians 2:7-11</a></span>; and so others also, that they might be taught <q>not to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse20">1 Timothy 1:20</a></span> And consider how he sent forth his own liegemen against him, rousing them, suppling them. And at one time he says to the Ephesians, <q>We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians 6:12</a></span> Then too he puts our prize in heavenly places. For we struggle not for things of the earth, he says, but for <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and the things in the Heavens. And to others, he says, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we shall judge Angels? How much more the things of this life?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 6:3</a></span> Let us then, laying all this to heart, stand nobly; for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, partaking of the same nature with us, and having everything else in common with us. But because he showed such great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward Christ, he went up above the Heavens, and stood with the Angels. And so if we too would rouse ourselves up some little, and kindle in ourselves that fire, we shall be able to emulate that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man. For were this impossible, he would never have cried aloud, and said, <q>Be imitators of me, as I am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 11:1</a></span> Let us not then admire him only, or be struck with him only, but imitate him, that we too may, when we depart hence, be counted worthy to see him, and to share the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> unutterable, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant that we may all attain to by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through Whom, and with Whom, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, now and evermore. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
