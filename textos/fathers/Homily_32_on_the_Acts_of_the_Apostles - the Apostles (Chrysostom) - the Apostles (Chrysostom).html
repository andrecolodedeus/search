<h1>Homily 32 on the Acts of the Apostles</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse1">Acts XV. 1</a></p>

<p><q>And certain men which came down from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> taught the brethren, and said, Unless you are <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> after the manner of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you cannot be saved.</q></p>

<p>Mark  how at every step of the right progress in respect of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the beginning is brought in as matter of necessity. Before this (Peter) being found fault with, justified himself, and said all that he said in the tone of apology, which was what made his words acceptable: then, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> having turned away, upon this (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) came to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Here again, seeing another extravagance coming in, upon this (the apostle) enacts the law. For as it is likely that they, as being taught of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, discoursed to all indifferently, this moved to jealousy them of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> (who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>). And they did not merely speak of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but they said, You cannot even be saved. Whereas the very opposite to this was the case, that receiving <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> they could not be saved. Do you mark how closely the trials succeed each other, from within, from without? It is well ordered too, that this happens when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is present, that he may answer them. <q>When therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a>, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and elders about this question.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse2">Acts 15:2</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does not say, What? Have I not a right to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> after so many signs? But he complied for their sakes. <q>And being brought on their way by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they passed through Phenice and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, declaring the conversion of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and they caused great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> unto all the brethren.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse3">Acts 15:3</a></span> And observe, the consequence is that all the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> also, learn what has come to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: and they rejoiced. <q>And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse4">Acts 15:4</a></span> See what a <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> is here! <q>But there rose up certain of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and elders came together to consider of this matter. And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up and said unto them, Men and brethren, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how that of old days God made choice among us, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by my mouth should hear the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse5">Acts 15:5-7</a></span> Observe Peter from the first standing aloof (<span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C7;&#x03C9;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>) from the affair, and even to this time judaizing. And yet (says he) <q>ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> <span class="stiki">ch. 10:45; 11:2</span> Perhaps those were present who of old found fault with him in the matter of Cornelius, and went in with him (on that occasion): for this reason he brings them forward as witnesses. <q>From old days,</q> he says, <q>did choose among you.</q> What means, <q>Among you?</q> Either, in Palestine, or, you being present. <q>By my mouth.</q> Observe how he shows that it was God speaking by him, and no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> utterance. <q>And <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the hearts, gave testimony unto them:</q> he refers them to the spiritual testimony: <q>by giving them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> even as unto us.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse8">Acts 15:8</a></span> Everywhere he puts the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> upon a thorough equality. <q>And put no difference between us and them, having purified their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse9">Acts 15:9</a></span> From <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, he says, they obtained the same gifts. This is also meant as a lesson to those (objectors); this is able to teach even them that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only is needed, not works nor <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. For indeed they do not say all this only by way of apology for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but to teach (the Jewish <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>) also to abandon the Law. However, at present this is not said. <q>Now therefore why do you tempt <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to put a yoke upon the neck of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse10">Acts 15:10</a></span> What means, <q>Tempt ye God?</q> As if He had not power to save by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Consequently, it proceeds from a want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, this bringing in the Law. Then he shows that they themselves were nothing benefited by it, and he turns the whole (stress of his speech) against the Law, not against them, and (so) cuts short the accusation of them: <q>which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear. But we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved, even as they.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse11">Acts 15:11</a></span> How full of power these words! The same that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says at large in the Epistle to the Romans, the same says Peter here. <q>For if <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> says (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>), <q>was justified by works, he has whereof to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but not before God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse2">Romans 4:2</a></span> Do you perceive that all this is more a lesson for them than apology for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>? However, if he had spoken this without a plea for speaking, he  would have been suspected: an occasion having offered, he lays hold of it, and speaks out fearlessly. See on all occasions how the designs of their foes are made to work with them. If those had not stirred the question, these things would not have been spoken, nor what follows. </p>

<p>(Recapitulation.) (<em>b</em>) But  let us look more closely at what has been said. <q>And certain men,</q> etc. In Jerusalem, then, there were not any <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> from among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: but in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> of course there were. Therefore  there came down certain yet laboring under this disease of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of rule, and wishing to have those of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> attached to them. And yet <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, though he too was learned in the Law, was not thus affected. <q>When therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> had no small disputation with them,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse2">Acts 15:2</a></span> But when he returned from thence, the doctrine also became more exact. For if they at Jerusalem enjoin no such thing, much more these (have no right to do so). <q>And being brought on their way,</q> etc, <q>they caused no small <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the brethren.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse3">Acts 15:3</a></span> Do you mark, as many as are not enamoured of rule, rejoiced in their believing? It was no ambitious feeling that prompted their recitals, neither was it for display, but in justification of the preaching to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse4">Acts 15:4</a></span> Thus they say nothing of what had happened in the matter of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.  <q>But there arose up certain of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse5">Acts 15:5</a></span> (<em>a</em>) But even if they would needs bring over the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to their side, they learn that neither must the Apostles overlook it.  <q>And the Apostles and elders,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse6">Acts 15:6</a></span> <q>Among us,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> chose:</q> and <q>from old days:</q> long ago, he says, not now. And  this too is no small point&mdash; at a time when <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, not turned away (from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>). <q>Among us;</q> an argument from the place: <q>of old days,</q> from the time. And that expression, <q>Chose:</q> just as in their own case  he says not, (so) willed it, but, <q>Chose that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by my mouth should hear the word of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> Whence is this <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>? From the Spirit. Then he shows that the testimony given them is not of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> merely, but of their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <q>And God which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the hearts bare them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse8">Acts 15:8</a></span>; having afforded to them nothing less (than to us), for, he says, <q>Put no difference between us and them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse9">Acts 15:9</a></span> Why then, hearts are what one must everywhere look to.  And it is very appositely said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the hearts bare them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>:</q> as in the former instance, <q>You, Lord, that <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> the hearts of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse24">Acts 1:24</a></span> For to show that this is the meaning, observe what he adds, <q>Put no difference between us and them.</q> When he has mentioned the testimony borne to them, then he utters that great word, the same which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaks, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> avails anything, nor uncircumcision.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse19">1 Corinthians 7:19</a></span> <q>That he may make the two one in Himself.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse5">Ephesians 2:5</a></span> Of all these the seeds lie in Peter's discourse. And he does not say (between) them of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but <q>Between us,</q> that is the Apostles, <q>and them.</q> Then, that the expression, <q>no difference</q> may not seem an outrage, After <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he says&mdash; <q>Having purified their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse10">Acts 15:10</a></span>&mdash; He thoroughly cleansed them first.  Then he shows, not that the Law was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but themselves weak.&mdash; <q>But we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved even as they.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse11">Acts 15:11</a></span> Mark how he ends with a fearful consideration. He  does not discourse to them from the Prophets, but from things present, of which themselves were witnesses. Of course  (the Prophets) also themselves anon add their testimony (<em>infra</em> v. 15), and make the reason stronger by what has now come to pass. And observe, he first permits the question to be moved in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and then speaks. <q>And put no difference between</q>&mdash; he said not, them of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, but <q>us and them,</q> i.e. the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: for  this (gradual advance) little by little is stronger. <q>Why therefore do you tempt God?</q> who has become (the) God of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: for this was tempting:  * * * whether He is able to save even after the Law. See what he does. He shows that they are in danger. For if, what the Law could not do, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had power to do, <q>we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved even as they</q> <span class="stiki">comp. <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse16"Galatians 2:16</a></span>: but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> falling off, behold, themselves (are) in destruction. And he did not say, Why do ye disbelieve? Which was more harsh, but, <q>Tempt <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and that when the fact is demonstrated.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Great effrontery this, of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, that even after <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they set up the Law, and will not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Apostles. But see these, how mildly they speak, and not in the tone of authority: such words are amiable, and more apt to fix themselves in the mind. Observe, it is nowhere a display of words, but demonstration by facts, by the Spirit. And yet, though they have such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, they still speak gently. And observe they  do not come accusing those at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, but <q>declaring all things that God had done with them:</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse4">Acts 15:4</a></span> but thence again these men lay hold upon the occasion (to compass their own objects), <q>but there rose up,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse1">Acts 15:1</a></span> Such were the pains they took in their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of power: and it was not with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Apostles that they <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and <a href="../cathen/02300a.htm">Barnabas</a> were blamed. But still they brought forward none of these charges: but when they have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the matter, then (the Apostles) write in stronger terms.</p>

<p>For gentleness  is everywhere a great good: gentleness, I say, not stupid indifference; gentleness, not adulation: for between these there is a vast difference. Nothing ruffled <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, nothing discomposed Peter. When you have convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, why lose your temper, to render these of none effect? It is impossible for one who is out of temper ever to persuade. Yesterday also we discoursed about <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; but there is no reason why we should not today also; perchance a second exhortation coming directly after the first will effect somewhat. For indeed a medicine though of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to heal a wound, unless it be constantly renewed, mars all. And think not that our continual discoursing about the same things is a condemning of you: for if we condemned you, we should not discourse; but now, hoping that you will gain much, we speak these things. Would indeed that we did speak constantly of the same things: would that there were no other subject of our discourses, than how we might overcome our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For is it not contrary to all reason, that while emperors, living in luxury and so great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, have no subject of discourse either while sitting at table, or at any other time, save only how to overcome their enemies &mdash; and therefore it is that they hold their assemblies each day, and appoint generals and soldiers, and demand taxes and tributes; and that of all state affairs, the moving causes are these two, the overcoming of those who make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon them, and the establishing of their subjects in peace&mdash; we have no mind for such themes as this, nor ever even dream of conversing upon them: but how we may buy land, or purchase slaves, and make our property greater, these are subjects we can talk about every day, and never be tired of them: while concerning things in ourselves and really our own, we neither wish to speak ourselves, nor so much as dream of tolerating advice, nor of enduring to hear others speaking about them? But answer me, what do you talk about? About dinner? Why that is a subject for cooks. Of money? Nay, that is a theme for hucksters and merchants. Of buildings? That belongs to carpenters and builders. Of land? That talk is for husbandmen. But for us, there is no other proper business, save this, how we may make <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Then let not the discourse be wearisome to you. Why is it that none finds fault with the physician for always discoursing of the healing art, nor with people of other crafts for talking about their peculiar arts? If indeed the mastery over our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> were really achieved, so that there were no need of putting us in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, we might reasonably be taxed with ambition and display: or rather, not then either. For even if it were gained, for all that, there would be need of discoursing, that one might not relapse and remain uncorrected: as in fact physicians discourse not only to the sick, but also to the whole, and they have books on this subject, on the one part how to free from disease, on the other how to preserve health. So that even if we are well, still we must not give over, but must do all in order to the preserving of our health. And when we are sick there is a twofold necessity for advice: first, that we may be freed from the disease; secondly, that having been freed, we may not fall into it again. Well then, we are discoursing now by the method of treating the sick, not by the rules for the treatment of the healthy.</p>

<p>How then may one root out this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> passion? How subdue (<span class="greek">&#x1F51;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B5;</span>) this violent fever? Let us see whence it had its birth, and let us remove the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Whence is it wont to arise? From arrogance and much haughtiness. This <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> then let us remove, and the disease is removed together with it. But what is arrogance? Whence does it arise? For perhaps we are likely to have to go back to a still higher origin. But whatever course the reason of the thing may point out, that let us take, that we may go to the bottom of the mischief, and pluck it up by the roots. Whence then comes arrogance? From our not looking into our own concerns, but instead of that, busying ourselves about the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of land, though we are not husbandmen, and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of gold, though we are not merchants, and concerning clothing, and everything else: while to ourselves and our own nature we never look at all. And who, you will say, is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his own nature? Many: perhaps all, save a few: and if you will, I will show the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of it. For, tell me, what is man? If one were asked, will he be able to answer outright to the questions, In what he differs from the brutes, in what he is akin to the heavenly inhabitants, what can be made of man? For as in the case of any other material, so also in this case: man is the subject-matter, but of this can be made either an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> or a beast. Does not this seem a strange saying? And yet you have often heard it in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For of certain <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings it was said, <q>he is the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mal002.htm#verse7">Malachi 2:7</a></span>: and <q>from his lips,</q> says it, <q>they shall seek judgment</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse1">Malachi 3:1</a></span>: and again, <q>I send My <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> before Your face:</q> but of some, <q>Serpents, generation of vipers.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse34">Matthew 12:34</a></span> So then, it all depends upon the use. Why do I say, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>? The man can become <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a child of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we read, <q>I have said, You are gods, and all of you are children of the Most High.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa081.htm#verse6">Psalm 82:6</a></span> And what is greater, the power to become both God and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> and child of God is put into his own hands. Yea, so it is, man can be the maker of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Perchance this saying has startled you? Hear however Christ saying: <q>In the Resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew 22:30</a></span> And again, <q>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew 19:12</a></span> In a word, it is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which makes <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: but this is in our power: therefore we are able to make <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, though not in nature, certainly in will. For indeed if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be absent, it is no advantage to be an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> by nature; and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this, who was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> once: but if <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> be present, it is no loss to be a man by nature; and John is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this, who was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and Elias who went up into heaven, and all those who are about to depart there. For these indeed, though with bodies, were not prevented from dwelling in heaven: while those others, though without bodies, could not remain in heaven. Let no one then grieve or be vexed with his nature as if it were a hindrance to him, but with his will. He (the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>) from being incorporeal became a lion: for lo! It says, <q>Our adversary, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1 Peter 5:8</a></span>: we from being corporeal, become <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For just as if a person, having found some precious material, should despise it, as not being an artificer, it will be a great loss to him, whether it be pearls, or a pearl shell, or any other such thing that he has seen; so we likewise, if we are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of our own nature, shall despise it much: but if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is, we shall exhibit much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and reap the greatest profits. For from this nature is wrought a king's robe, from this a king's house, from this nature are fashioned a king's members: all are kingly. Let us not then misuse our own nature to our hurt. He has made us <q>a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa008.htm#verse5">Psalm 8:5</a></span>, I mean, by reason of death: but even that little we have now recovered. There is nothing therefore to hinder us from becoming near to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, if we will. Let us then will it, let us will it, and having exercised ourselves thoroughly, let us return <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now and ever, world without end, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
