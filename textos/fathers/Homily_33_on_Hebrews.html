<h1>Homily 33 on Hebrews</h1>

<h2>Hebrews 12:28-29</h2>

<p><q> <em>Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> [or gratitude,]</em>  <em>whereby we serve</em>  <em>God acceptably with reverence and godly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For our God is a consuming fire.</em></q></p>

<p>1. In another place he says the same, <q>for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 4:18</a></span>; and from this makes an exhortation with regard to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which we endure in this present life; and here he does this, and says, let us continue steadfast; <q>let us have thankfulness,</q> i.e., let us give thanks unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For not only we ought not to be discouraged at present things, but even to show the greatest gratitude to Him, for those to come.</p>

<p><q>Whereby we serve God acceptably,</q> that is to say, 'for thus is it possible to serve God acceptably,' by giving him thanks in all things. <q>Do all things</q> (he says) <q>without murmurings and disputings.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse14">Philippians 2:14</a></span> For whatever work a man does with murmuring, he cuts away and loses his reward; as the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>&mdash; how great a penalty they paid for their murmurings. Wherefore he says, <q>Neither murmur ye.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 10:10</a></span> It is not therefore possible to <q>serve</q> Him <q>acceptably</q> without a sense of gratitude to Him for all things, both for our trials, and the alleviations of them. That is, let us utter nothing hasty, nothing disrespectful, but let us <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> ourselves that we may be reverential. For this is <q>with reverence and godly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Hebrews 13:1-2</h2>

<p><q>Let brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> continue. Be not forgetful of hospitality,  for hereby some have entertained <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> unawares.</q> See how he enjoins them to preserve what they had: he does not add other things. He did not say, <q>Be loving as brethren,</q> but, <q>Let brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> continue.</q> And again, he did not say, <q>Be hospitable,</q> as if they were not, but, <q>Be not forgetful of hospitality,</q> for this was likely to happen owing to their afflictions.</p>

<p>Therefore  (he says) <q>some have entertained <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> unawares.</q> Do you see how great was the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, how great the gain!</p>

<p>What is <q>unawares</q>?  They entertained them without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it. Therefore the reward also was great, because he entertained them, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that they were Angels. For if he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, it would have been nothing wonderful. Some say that he here alludes to <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> also.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 13:3-6</h2>

<p>2. <q>Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them, them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body. Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> in all,  and the bed undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge. Let your conversation be without <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: being content with such things as you have.</q></p>

<p>See how large is his discourse concerning <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. <q>Follow peace,</q> he said, <q>and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; Lest there be any fornicator or profane person</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews 12:14</a></span>; and again, <q>Fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse16">Hebrews 12:16</a></span> In every case, the prohibition is with a penalty. <q>Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> he says, <q>and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, without which no man shall see the Lord: But fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</q></p>

<p>And having first set down <q>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the bed undefiled,</q> he shows that he rightly added what follows. For if marriage has been conceded, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> is the fornicator punished, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> does the adulterer suffer vengeance.</p>

<p>Here he strips for  the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. He did not say again, Let no one be a fornicator; but having said it once for all, he then went on as  with a general exhortation, and not as directing himself against them.</p>

<p><q>Let your conversation be without <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>,</q> he says. He did not say, Possess nothing, but, <q>Let your conversation be without <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a></q>: that is, let it show forth the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophical</a> character of your mind.  [And it will show it, if we do not seek superfluities, if we keep only to what is necessary.]  For he says above also, <q>And ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse34">Hebrews 10:34</a></span> He gives these exhortations, that they might not be <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>.</p>

<p><q>Being content</q> (he says) <q>with such things as you have.</q> Then here also the consolation; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse5">Hebrews 13:5</a></span> <q>For He</q> (he says) <q>has said, I will never leave you nor forsake you</q>; <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse6">Hebrews 13:6</a></span> <q>so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man shall do unto me.</q> Again consolation in their trials.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 13:7</h2>

<p>3. <q>Remember them which have the rule over you.</q> This he was laboring to say above: therefore <q>Follow peace with all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews 12:14</a></span> He gave this exhortation also to the Thessalonians, to <q>hold them in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> exceedingly.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse13">1 Thessalonians 5:13</a></span></p>

<p><q>Remember</q> (he says) <q>them which have the rule over you,  who have spoken unto you the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> follow, considering the end of their conversation.</q> What kind of following is this? Truly the best: for he says, beholding their life, <q>follow their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> For from a pure life [comes] <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Or else by <q><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> he means steadfastness. How so? Because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the things to come. For they would not have shown forth a pure life, if they had questioned about the things to come, if they had <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>. So that here also he is applying a remedy to the same [<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>]. </p>

<h2>Hebrews 13:8-9</h2>

<p><q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the same yesterday and today and for ever. Be not carried about with various and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a>. For it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> that the heart be established with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</q></p>

<p>In these words, <q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the same yesterday and today and for ever,</q> <q>yesterday</q> means all the time that is past: <q>today,</q> the present: <q>for ever,</q> the endless which is to come. That is to say: You have heard of an High Priest, but not an High Priest who fails. He is always the same. As though there were some who said, 'He is not, another will come,' he says this, that He who was <q>yesterday and today,</q> is <q>the same also for ever.</q> For even now the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say, that another will come; and having deprived themselves of Him that is will fall into the hands of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.</p>

<p><q>Be not carried about with various and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a>.</q> Not <q>with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a></q> only, but neither with <q>various ones.</q></p>

<p><q>For it is a good thing that the heart be established with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied  therein.</q> Here he gently hints at those who introduce the observance of <q>meats.</q> For by Faith all things are pure. There is need then of Faith, not of <q>meats.</q></p>

<h2>Hebrews 13:10</h2>

<p>For <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse10">Hebrews 13:10</a></span> <q>we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve  the Tabernacle.</q> Not as the Jewish [ordinances], are those among us, as it is not lawful even for the High Priest to partake of them. So that since he had said, <q>Do not observe,</q>  and this seemed to be [the language] of one who is throwing down his own building, he again turns it round. What, have not we then observances as well (he says)? [Yea we have], and we observe them very earnestly too, not sharing them even with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> themselves.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 13:11-13</h2>

<p>4. <q>For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the High Priest for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are burned without the camp. Wherefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people with His own blood, suffered</q> (he says) <q>without the gate.</q> Do you see the type shining forth? <q>For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> he says, and <q>suffered without the gate.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse13">Hebrews 13:13</a></span> <q>Let us go forth therefore to Him without the camp, bearing His reproach,</q> that is, suffering the same things; having communion with Him in His sufferings. He was crucified without as a condemned person: neither let us then be ashamed to <q>go forth out</q> [of the world].</p>

<h2>Hebrews 13:14-15</h2>

<p><q>For we have here no continuing city</q> (he says) <q>but we seek one to come. By Him therefore let us offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to His Name.</q></p>

<p><q>By Him,</q> as by an High Priest, according to the flesh.  <q>Giving thanks</q>  (he says) <q>to His Name.</q> (See p. 514.) Let us utter nothing <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>, nothing hasty, nothing bold, nothing presumptuous, nothing desperate. This is <q>with reverence and godly <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse28">Hebrews 12:28</a></span> For a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in tribulations becomes desponding, and reckless.  But let not us [be so]. See here he again says the same thing which he said before, <q>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together,</q> for so shall we be able to do all things  with reverence. For oftentimes even out of respect for men, we refrain from doing many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.</p>

<h2>Hebrews 13:16</h2>

<p><q>But to do good and to communicate forget not.</q> I speak not [merely] with reference to the brethren present, but to those absent also. But if others have plundered your property, display your hospitality out of such things as you have. What excuse then shall we have henceforward, when they, even after the spoiling of their goods, were thus admonished?</p>

<p>5. And he did not say, <q>Be not forgetful</q> of the entertaining of strangers,  but <q>of hospitality</q>:  that is, do not merely entertain strangers, but [do it] with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the strangers. Moreover he did not speak of the recompense that is future, and in store for us, lest he should make them more supine, but of that already given. For <q>thereby some</q> (he says) <q>have entertained <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> unawares.</q></p>

<p>But let us see in what sense <q>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> in all and the bed undefiled.</q> Because (he means) it preserves the believer in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Here he also alludes to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, because they accounted the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> after childbirth  polluted: and <q>whosoever comes from the bed,</q> it is said, <q>is not clean.</q>  Those things are not polluted  which arise from nature, O ungrateful and senseless Jew,  but those which arise from choice.  For if <q>marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a></q> and pure, why forsooth do you think that one is even polluted by it?</p>

<p><q>Let your conversation</q> (he says) <q>be without <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a></q>: since many after having exhausted  their property, afterwards wish to recover it again under the guise of <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, therefore he says, <q>Let your conversation be without <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a></q>; that is, that we should be [desirous only] of what is necessary  and indispensable. What then (you say) if we should not have a supply even of these? This is not possible; indeed it is not. <q>For He has said,</q> and He does not lie, <q>I will never leave you, nor forsake you. So that we boldly say, The Lord is my Helper, and I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man shall do unto me.</q> You have the promise from Himself: do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> henceforward. He has promised; make no question. But this, <q>I will never leave you,</q> he says not concerning money only, but concerning all other things also. <q>The Lord is my Helper, and I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man shall do unto me</q>; with good reason.</p>

<p>This then also let us say in all <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>; let us laugh at <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things, so long as we have God favorable to us. For as, when He is our enemy, it is no gain, though all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be our friends, so when He is our friend, though all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> together <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against us, there is no harm. <q>I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man shall do unto me.</q></p>

<p>6. <q>Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> In this place I think that he is speaking about assistance also.  For this is [implied in the words] <q>who have spoken unto you the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p><q>Whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> follow considering the end of their conversation.</q> What is, <q>considering</q>?  Continually revolving, examining it by yourselves, reasoning, investigating accurately, testing it as you choose. <q>The end of their conversation,</q> that is, their conversation to the end: for <q>their conversation</q> had a good end.</p>

<p><q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the same yesterday and today and for ever.</q> Do not think that then indeed He wrought wonders, but now works no wonders. He is the same. This is, <q>remember them that have the rule over you.</q> </p>

<p><q>Be not carried about with various and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a>.</q> <q>Strange,</q> that is, different from those ye heard from us; [<q>Divers</q>] that is, of all sorts: for they have no stability, but are different [one from another]. For especially manifold  is the doctrine of meats.</p>

<p><q>For it is a good thing that the heart be established with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; not with meats.</q> These are the <q>various,</q> these the <q>strange</q>  [doctrines]: especially as Christ has said, <q>not that which enters into the mouth defiles the man, but that which comes out.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse11">Matthew 15:11</a></span> And observe that he does not make bold to say this openly, but as it were by a hint.  <q>For it is a good thing that the heart be established with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not with meats.</q></p>

<p>Faith is all. If that establishes [it], the heart stands in security. It follows that Faith establishes: consequently reasonings shake. For Faith is contrary to reasoning.</p>

<p><q>Which</q> (he says) <q>have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</q> For what is the gain from the observance  [of them], tell me. Does it not rather destroy? Does it not make such an one to be under <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? If it be  necessary to observe [them], we must guard ourselves. </p>

<p><q>Which</q> (he says) <q>have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</q> That is, who have always diligently kept them.</p>

<p>There is one observance, abstaining from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For what profit is it, when some are so polluted, as not to be able to partake of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>? So that it did not save them at all; although they were <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> about the observances. But because they had not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even thus they profited nothing.</p>

<p>7. In the next place he takes away  the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> from the type, and directs his discourse to the prototype, saying, <q>The bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the High Priest, are burned without the camp.</q> Then those things were a type of these and thus Christ, suffering <q>without,</q> fulfilled all.</p>

<p>Here he makes it plain too that He suffered voluntarily, showing  that those things were not accidental, but even the [Divine] arrangement itself was of a suffering <q>without.</q> [He suffered] without, but His Blood was borne up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. You see then that we partake of Blood which has been carried into the Holy Place, the True Holy Place; of the Sacrifice of which the Priest alone had the privilege. We therefore partake of the Truth [the Reality]. If then we partake not of <q>reproach</q> [only] but of sanctification,  the <q>reproach</q> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the sanctification. For as He was reproached, so also are we. If we go forth <q>without</q> therefore, we have fellowship with Him.</p>

<p>But what is, <q>Let us go forth to Him</q>? Let us have fellowship with Him in His sufferings; let us bear His reproach. For He did not simply bid us dwell <q>outside the gate,</q> but as He was reproached as a condemned person, so also we.</p>

<p>And <q>by Him let us offer a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Of what kind of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> does he speak? <q>The fruit of lips giving thanks to His Name.</q> They [the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>] brought sheep, and calves, and gave them to the Priest: let <q>us</q> bring none of these things, but thanksgiving. This <q>fruit</q> let <q>our lips</q> put forth.</p>

<p><q>For with such <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> God is well pleased.</q> Let us give such a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to Him, that He may offer [it] to The Father. For in no other way it is offered except through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or rather also through a contrite mind. All these things [are said] for the weak. For that the thanks belong to the Son is evident: since otherwise, how is the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> equal? <q>That all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a></q> (He says) <q>should <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the Son even as they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the Father.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse23">John 5:23</a></span> Wherein is the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> equal? <q>The fruit of our lips giving thanks to His Name.</q> </p>

<p>8. Let us bear all things thankfully, be it poverty, be it disease, be it anything else whatever: for He alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things expedient for us. <q>For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans 8:26</a></span> We then who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even how to ask for what is fitting, unless we have received of  the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, let us take care to offer up thanksgiving for all things, and let us bear all things nobly. Are we in poverty? Let us give thanks. Are we in sickness? Let us give thanks. Are we <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused? Let us give thanks: when we suffer affliction, let us give thanks.</p>

<p>This brings us near to God: then we even have God for our debtor. But when we are in prosperity, it is we who are debtors and liable to be called to account. For when we are in prosperity, we are debtors to God: and oftentimes these things bring a judgment upon us, while those are for a payment of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.  Those [afflictions] draw down mercy, they draw down kindness: &nbsp;while these on the other hand lift up even to an insane <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and lead also to slothfulness, and dispose a man to fancy great things concerning himself; they puff up. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also said, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me, Lord, that You have afflicted  me; that I may learn Your statutes.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa118.htm#verse71">Psalm 119:71</a></span> When Hezekiah had received blessings and been freed from calamities, his heart was lifted up on high; when he fell sick, then was he humbled, then he became near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>When He slew them,</q> it says, <q>then they sought Him diligently, and turned, and were early in coming to  God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa077.htm#verse34">Psalm 78:34</a></span> And again, <q>When the beloved waxed gross and fat, then he kicked.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy 32:15</a></span> For <q>the Lord is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when He executes judgments.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa009.htm#verse16">Psalm 9:16</a></span></p>

<p>9. Affliction is a great good. <q>Narrow is the way</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse14">Matthew 7:14</a></span>, so that affliction  thrusts us into the narrow [way]. He who is not pressed by affliction cannot enter. For he who afflicts himself in the narrow [way], is he who also enjoys ease; but he that spreads himself out,  does not enter in, and suffers from being so to say wedged in.  See how <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> enters into this narrow way. He <q>keeps under</q> his <q>body</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 9:27</a></span>, so as to be able to enter. Therefore, in all his afflictions, he continued giving thanks unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Have you lost your property? This has lightened you of the most of your wideness. Have you fallen from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? This is  another sort of wideness. Have you been <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused? Have the things said against you, of which you are nowise conscious to yourself been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? <q>Rejoice and leap for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q> For <q>blessed are you</q> (He says) <q>when men reproach you, and say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, for My sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse11">Matthew 5:11-12</a></span></p>

<p>Why do you marvel, if you are grieved, and wish to be set free from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wished to be set free, and oftentimes entreated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and did not obtain. For the <q>thrice for this I besought the Lord,</q> is oftentimes; <q>and He said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 12:8-9</a></span> By <q>weakness,</q> he here means <q>afflictions.</q> What then? When he heard this he received it thankfully, and says, <q>Wherefore I take pleasure in infirmities</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse10">2 Corinthians 12:10</a></span>; that is, I am pleased, I rest in my afflictions. For all things then let us give thanks, both for comfort, and for affliction.  Let us not murmur: let us not be unthankful. <q>Naked came I out of my mother's womb, naked also shall I depart.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job 1:21</a></span> You did not come forth <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, do not seek <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. You were brought into life naked, not of money alone, but also of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> name.</p>

<p>Consider how great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> have oftentimes arisen from <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. For <q>It is easier</q> (it is said) <q>for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse24">Matthew 19:24</a></span> Do you see to how many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is a hindrance, and do you seek to be rich? Do you not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that the hindrance has been overthrown? So narrow is the way which leads into the Kingdom. So broad is <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and full of bulk and swelling out. Therefore He says, <q>Sell that you have</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew 19:21</a></span>, that that way may receive you. Why do you yearn after <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>? For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> He took it away from you, that He might free you from slavery. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fathers also, when a son is corrupted by some mistress, and having given him much exhortation they do not persuade him to part from her, send the mistress into banishment. Such also is abundance of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. Because the Lord cares for us, and delivers us from the harm [which arises] therefrom, He takes away <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> from us.</p>

<p>Let us not then think poverty an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For neither is <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> a good thing by itself: to be well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is the only good. Poverty then let us seek, this let us pursue: so shall we lay hold on heaven, so shall we attain to the other <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Which may we all attain by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, power, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and ever and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
