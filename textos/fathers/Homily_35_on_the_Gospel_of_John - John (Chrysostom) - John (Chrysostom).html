<h1>Homily 35 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 4:40-43</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>So when the Samaritans had come unto Him, they besought Him that He would tarry with them: and He abode there two days. And many more believed because of His own Word; and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that This is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. Now after two days He departed thence, and went into Galilee.</q></div>

<p>Nothing is worse than <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, nothing more mischievous than vainglory; it is wont to mar ten thousand <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. So the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who excelled the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and had been always familiar with  the Prophets, were shown from this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> inferior to them. For these <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> even on the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and without having seen any sign, came forth beseeching Christ to tarry  with them; but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when they had beheld His wonders, not only did not detain Him among them, but even drove Him away, and used every means to cast Him forth from their land, although His very Coming  had been for their sake. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> expelled Him, but these even entreated Him to tarry with them. Was it not then rather fitting, tell me, that He should receive those who asked and besought Him, than that He should wait upon those who plotted against and repulsed Him, while to those who loved and desired to retain Him He gave not Himself? Surely this would not have been worthy of His tender care;  He therefore both accepted  them, and tarried with them two days. They desired to keep Him among them continually, (for this the Evangelist has shown by saying, that <q>they besought Him that He would tarry with them,</q>) but this He endured not, but stayed with them only two days; and in these many more <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him. Yet there was no likelihood that these would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, since they had seen no sign, and had hostile feelings towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but still, inasmuch as they gave in sincerity their judgment on His words, this stood not in their way, but they received a notion which surmounted their hindrances, and vied with each other to reverence Him the more. For, says the Evangelist, <q>they said to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, Now we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, not because of your saying: for we have heard Him ourselves, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is indeed the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Saviour of the world.</q> The scholars overshot their instructress. With good reason might they condemn the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, both by their believing on, and their receiving Him. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for whose sake He had contrived  the whole scheme,  continually were for <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a> Him,  but these, when He was not even intending to come to them, drew Him to themselves. And they, even with signs, remain uncorrected; these, without signs, manifested great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> respecting Him, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in this very thing that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> without them; while the others ceased not asking  for signs and tempting Him.</p>

<p>Such need is there everywhere of an honest <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> lay hold on such an one, she easily masters it; or if she masters it not, this is owing not to any weakness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but to want of candor  in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself. Since the sun too, when he encounters clear eyes, easily enlightens them; if he enlightens them not, it is the fault of their infirmity, not of his weakness.</p>

<p>Hear then what these say; <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Saviour of the world.</q> Do you see how they at once understood that He should draw the world to Him, that He came to order aright  our common <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that He intended not to confine His care to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, but to sow His Word everywhere? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did not so, but going about to establish their own righteousness, submitted not themselves to the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while these confess that all are deserving of punishment, declaring with the Apostle, that <q>all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and come short of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse23">Romans 3:23-24</a></span>  For by saying that He was <q>the Saviour of the world,</q> they showed that it was of a lost world,  and He not simply a Saviour, but one of the very mightiest. For many had come to <q>save,</q> both Prophets and Angels ; but this, says one, is the True Saviour, who affords the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not that which is but for a time. This proceeded from pure <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And in both ways are they admirable; because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and because they did so without signs, (whom Christ also calls <q>blessed,</q> saying, <q>Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>,</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse29">John 20:29</a>,</span> and because they did so sincerely. Though they had heard the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> say doubtfully, <q>Is not this the Christ?</q> they did not also say, <q>we too suspect,</q> or, <q>we think,</q>  but, <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> and not merely, <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> but, <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the Saviour of the world.</q> They acknowledged Christ not as one of the many,  but as the <q>Saviour</q> indeed. Yet whom had they seen saved? They had but heard His words, and yet they spoke as they would have spoken had they beheld many and great marvels. And why do not the Evangelists tell us these words, and that He discoursed admirably? That you may learn that they pass by many important matters, and yet have declared the whole to us by the event. For He persuaded an entire people and a whole city by His words. When His hearers are not persuaded, then the writers are constrained to mention what was said, lest any one from the insensibility of the hearers should give a judgment against Him who addressed them.</p>

<p><q>Now after two days He departed thence and went into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>.</q></p>

<h2>John 4:44</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>For Jesus Himself testified that a Prophet has no honor in his own country.</q></div>

<p>Wherefore is this added? Because He departed not unto Capernaum, but into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, and thence to <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>. For that you may not enquire why He tarried not with His own people, but tarried with the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, the Evangelist puts the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>,  saying that they gave no heed unto Him; on this account He went not there, that their condemnation might not be the greater. For I suppose that in this place He speaks of Capernaum as <q>His country.</q> Now, to show that there He received no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, hear Him say, <q>And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shall be brought down to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse23">Matthew 11:23</a></span> He calls it <q>His own country,</q> because there He set forth the Word of the Dispensation, and more especially dwelt upon it. <q>What then,</q> says some one, <q>do we not see many admired among their kindred?</q> In the first place such judgments must not be formed from rare instances; and again, if some have been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in their own, they would have been much more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in a strange country, for familiarity is wont to make men easily despised.</p>

<h2>John 4:45</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Then when He had come into Galilee, the Galil&aelig;ans received Him, having seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at the feast, for they also came unto the feast.</q></div>

<p>Do you see that these men so ill spoken of are found most to come to Him? For one said, <q>Can there any good thing come out of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse46">John 1:46</a></span>, and another, <q>Search and look, for out of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> arises no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse52">John 7:52</a></span> These things they said insulting Him, because He was supposed by the many to be of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, and they also reproached Him with being a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>; <q>You are a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>,</q> said one, <q>and hast a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse48">John 8:48</a></span> Yet behold, both <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> and Galil&aelig;ans <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, to the shame of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> are found better than Galil&aelig;ans, for the first received Him through the words of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the second when they had seen the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He did.</p>

<h2>John 4:46</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where He made the water wine.</q></div>

<p>The Evangelist reminds the hearer of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> to exalt the praise of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>. The men of <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> received Him by reason of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which He had done in Jerusalem and in that place; but not so the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, they received Him through His teaching alone.</p>

<p>That He came then <q>to <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>,</q> the Evangelist has said, but he has not added the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why He came.  Into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> He had come because of the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but wherefore to <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>? At first He came, being invited to a marriage; but wherefore now? Methinks to confirm by His presence the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which had been implanted by His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>, and to draw them to Him the more by coming to them self-invited, by leaving His own country, and by preferring them.</p>

<p><q>And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.</q></p>

<h2>John 4:47</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>When he heard that Jesus had come out of Jud&aelig;a into Galilee, he went unto Him and besought Him that He would come down and heal his son.</q></div>

<p>This person certainly was of royal race, or possessed some dignity from his office, to which the title <q>noble</q> was attached. Some indeed think that this is the man mentioned by Matthew <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse5">Matthew 8:5</a></span>, but he is shown to be a different person, not only from his dignity, but also from his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. That other, even when Christ was  willing to go to him, entreats Him to tarry; this one, when He had made no such offer, draws Him to his house. The one says, <q>I am not worthy that You should come under my roof</q>; but this other even urges  Him, saying, <q>Come down ere my son die.</q> In that instance He came down from the mountain, and entered into Capernaum; but here, as He came from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and went not into Capernaum but into <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>, this person met Him. The servant of the other was possessed by the palsy, this one's son by a fever.</p>

<p><q>And he came and besought Him that He would heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</q> What says Christ?</p>

<h2>John 4:48</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.</q></div>

<p>Yet the very coming and beseeching Him was a mark of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And besides, after this the Evangelist witnesses to him,  declaring that when Jesus said, <q>Go, your son lives,</q> he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> His word, and went. What then is that which He says here? Either He uses the words as approving of  the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> without signs; or, to touch Capernaum which was thought to be His own city, and of which this person was. Moreover, another man in Luke, who says, <q>Lord, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> said besides, <q>help my unbelief.</q>  And so if this ruler also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, yet he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not entirely or soundly, as is clear from his enquiring <q>at what hour the fever left him,</q> since he desired to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether it did so of its own accord, or at the bidding of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. When therefore he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was <q>yesterday at the seventh hour,</q> then <q>himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and his whole house.</q></p> 

<p>Do you see that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> when his servants, not when Christ spoke? Therefore He rebukes the state of mind with which he had come to Him, and spoken as he did, (thus too He the more drew him on to belief,) because that before the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> he had not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> strongly. That he came and entreated was nothing wonderful, for <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> in their great affection are also wont to resort not only to physicians in whom they have confidence, but also to talk with those in whom they have no confidence, desiring to omit nothing whatever.  Indeed, that he came without any strong purpose  appears from this, that when Christ had come into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>, then he saw Him, whereas if he had firmly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him, he would not, when his child was on the point of death, have hesitated to go into Jud&aelig;a. Or if he was afraid, this is not to be endured either. </p>

<p>Observe how the very words show the weakness of the man; when he ought, after Christ had rebuked his state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to have imagined something great concerning Him, even if he did not so before, listen how he drags along the ground.</p>

<h2>John 4:49</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Sir, come down ere my child die.</q></div>

<p>As though He could not raise him after death, as though He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what state the child was in. It is for this that Christ rebukes him and touches his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, to show that His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were wrought principally for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For here He heals the father, sick in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, no less than the son, in order to persuade us to give heed to Him, not by reason of His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but of His teaching. For <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are not for the faithful, but for the unbelieving and the grosser sort.</p>

<p>3. At that time then, owing to his emotion, the nobleman gave no great heed to the words, or to those only which related to his son,  yet he would afterwards recollect what had been said, and draw from thence the greatest advantage. As indeed was the case.</p>

<p>But what can be the reason why in the case of the centurion He by a free offer undertook to come, while here though invited, He goes not? Because in the former case <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had been perfected, and therefore He undertook to go, that we might learn the rightmindedness of the man; but here the nobleman was imperfect. When therefore he continually  urged Him, saying, <q>Come down,</q> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not yet clearly that even when absent He could heal, He shows that even this was possible unto Him in order that this man might gain from Jesus not going, that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which the centurion had of himself.  And so when He says,<q> Unless you see signs and wonders, you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> His meaning is, <q>You have not yet the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, but still feel towards Me as towards a Prophet.</q> Therefore to reveal Himself and to show that he ought to have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> even without <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, He said what He said also to Philip, <q>Believest thou  that the Father is in Me and I in the Father?  Or if not, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me for the very works' sake.</q> <span class="stiki">c. xiv. 10, 11</span></p>

<h2>John 4:51-53</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Your son lives. Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. So the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which Jesus said unto him, Your son lives; and himself believed, and his whole house.</q></div>

<p>Do you see how evident the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> was? Not simply nor in a common way was the child freed from danger, but all at once, so that what took place was seen to be the consequence not of nature, but the working  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For when he had reached the very gates of death, as his father showed by saying, <q>Come down ere my child die</q>; he was all at once freed from the disease. A fact which roused the servants also, for they perhaps came to meet their master, not only to bring him the good news, but also deeming that the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was now superfluous, (for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that their master had gone there,) and so they met him even in the way. The man released from his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, thenceforth escaped  into <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, being desirous to show that what had been done was the result of his journey, and thenceforth he is ambitious of appearing not to have exerted himself  to no purpose; so he ascertained all things exactly, and <q>himself <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and his whole house.</q> For the evidence was after this unquestionable. For they who had not been present nor had heard Christ speak nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the time, when they had heard from their master that such and such was the time, had incontrovertible demonstration of His power. Wherefore they also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>What now are we taught by these things? Not to wait for <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, nor to seek pledges of the Power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I see many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> even now become more <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>,  when during the sufferings of a child or the sickness of a wife they enjoy any comfort, yet they ought even if they obtain it not, to persist just the same in giving thanks, in glorifying God. Because it is the part of right-minded servants, and of those who feel such affection  and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as they ought for their Master, not only when pardoned, but also when scourged, to run to Him. For these also are effects of the tender care of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <q>Whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges,</q> it says, <q>every son whom He receives.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews 12:6</a></span> When therefore a man serves Him only in the season of ease, he gives <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of no great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and loves not Christ purely. And why speak I of health, or abundant riches, or poverty, or disease? Should thou hear of the fiery pit or of any other dreadful thing, not even so must thou cease from speaking good of your Master, but suffer and do all things because of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Him. For this is the part of right-minded servants and of an unswerving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and he who is disposed after this sort will easily endure the present, and obtain good  things to come, and enjoy much confidence in the presence of  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which may it be that we all obtain through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
