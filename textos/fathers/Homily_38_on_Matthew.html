<h1>Homily 38 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Matthew 11:25-26.</strong></p>

<p><q> <em>At that time Jesus answered and said, I make acknowledgment unto You</em>,  <em>O Father, Lord of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> and earth; because You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and hast revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for so it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in Your sight.</em></q>  </p>

<p>Do you see, how many ways He leads them on to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? First, <span class="stiki" id="note201608"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;11:7-11</a></span> by His praises of John. For by pointing to him as a great and marvellous one, He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> likewise all his sayings credible, whereby he used to draw them on to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him. Secondly, <span class="stiki" id="note201609"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;11:12</a></span> by saying, <q>The kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and the violent take it by force;</q> for this is the language of one who is pressing and urging them. Thirdly, <span class="stiki" id="note201610"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;6:13</a></span> by signifying that the number of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> was finished; for this too manifested Himself to be the person that was announced beforehand by them. Fourthly, <span class="stiki" id="note201611"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;6:14-19</a></span> by pointing out that whatsoever things should be done by him, were all accomplished; at which time  also He made mention of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the children. Fifthly, by His upbraiding them that had not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and by His alarming and threatening them greatly. <span class="stiki" id="note201612"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;11:20-24</a></span> Sixthly, by His giving thanks for them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For the expression, <q>I make acknowledgment to You,</q> here is, <q>I thank You.</q> <q>I thank You,</q> He says, <q>because You have hid these things from the wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>.</q></p>

<p>What then? Does He <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in destruction, and in the others not having received this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? By no means; but this is a most excellent way of His to save men, His not forcing them that utterly reject, and are not willing to receive His sayings; that, since they were not bettered by His call, but fell back, and despised it, His casting them out might <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to fall into a longing for these things. And so likewise the attentive would grow more earnest.</p>

<p>And while His being revealed to these was fit matter of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, His concealment from those was no more of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> but of tears. Thus at any rate He acts, where He weeps for the city. Not therefore because of this does He <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, but because what wise men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to these. As when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>I thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you were servants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> from the heart the form of doctrine which was delivered unto you.</q>  You see, neither does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, because they were <q>servants of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> but because being such, they had been so highly favored.</p>

<p>Now by the <q>wise,</q> here, He means the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. And these things He says, to make the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> more earnest, and to show what had been vouchsafed to the fishermen, when all those others had missed of it. And in calling them <q>wise,</q> He means not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and commendable wisdom, but this which they seemed to have through natural shrewdness. Wherefore neither did He say, <q>you have revealed it to fools,</q> but <q>to babes;</q> to unsophisticated, that is, to simple-minded men; and He implies that so far from their missing these privileges contrary to their desert, it was just what might be expected. And He instructs us throughout, to be free from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and to follow after simplicity. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also expressed it with more exceeding earnestness, writing on this wise: <q>If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201614"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:18</a></span> For thus is God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> manifested.</p>

<p>But wherefore does He give thanks to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, although of course it was Himself who wrought this? As He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> and intercedes with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, showing His great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards us, in the same way does He this too: for this also is of much <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. And He signifies, that not from Him only had they fallen away, but also from the Father. Thus, what He said, speaking to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Cast not the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things unto dogs,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201615"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> this He Himself anticipated them in performing.</p>

<p>Moreover He signifies hereby both His own principal will, and that of the Father; His own, I say, by His giving thanks and rejoicing at what had taken place; His Father's, by intimating that neither had He done this upon entreaty, but of Himself upon His own will; <q>For so,</q> says He, <q>it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in Your sight:</q> that is, <q>so it pleased You.</q></p>

<p>And wherefore was it hidden from them? Hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, saying, that <q>Seeking to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201617"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3</a></span> </p>

<p>Consider now how it was likely the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should be affected, hearing this; that what wise men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, these <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it continuing babes, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it by God's revelation. But Luke says, that <q>at the very hour,</q> when the seventy came telling Him about the devils, then He <q>rejoiced</q> and spoke these things, <span class="stiki" id="note201619"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;10:21</a></span> which, besides increasing their diligence, would also dispose them to be modest. That is, since it was natural for them to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves on their driving away devils, on this among other grounds He refrains them; that it was a revelation, whatever had been done, no diligence on their part. Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, and the wise men, thinking to be intelligent for themselves, fell away through their own vanity. Well then, if for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it was hidden from them, <q>do you also,</q> says He, <q><a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and continue babes.</q> For this caused you to have the benefit of the revelation, as indeed on the other hand the contrary made them be deprived of it. For by  no means, when He says, <q>You have hid,</q> does He mean that it is all God's doing: but as when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>He gave them over to a reprobate <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201620"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;1:28</a></span> and, <q>He has blinded their minds,</q> it is not meant to bring Him in as the doer of it, but those who gave the occasion: so here also He uses the expression, <q>You have hid.</q></p>

<p>For since He had said, <q>I thank  You, because You have hid them, and hast revealed them unto babes;</q> to hinder your supposing that as being Himself deprived of this power, and unable to effect it, so He offers thanks, He says,</p>

<p><q>All things are delivered unto me of my Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201623"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> And to them that are rejoicing, because the devils <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> them, <q>Nay, why marvel,</q> says He, <span class="stiki" id="note201624"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;10:22</a></span> that devils yield to you? All things are mine; <q>All things are delivered unto me.</q></p>

<p>But when you hear, <q>they are delivered,</q> do not surmise anything <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. For He uses this expression, to prevent your imagining two unoriginate Gods. Since, that He was at the same time both begotten, and Lord of all, He declares in many ways, and in other places also.</p>

<p>2. Then He says what is even greater than this, lifting up your mind; <q>And no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father; neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> any man the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but the Son.</q> Which seems indeed to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> unconnected with what went before, but has full accordance therewith. As thus: having said, <q>All things are delivered unto me of my Father,</q> He adds, <q>And what marvel,</q> so He speaks, <q>if I be Lord of all? I who have also another greater privilege, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and being of the same substance.</q> Yea, for this too He covertly signifies by His being the only one who so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him. For this is His meaning, when He says, <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father but the Son.</q></p>

<p>And see at what time He says this. When they by His works had received the certain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His might, not only seeing Him work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, but endowed also in His name with so great powers. Then, since He had said, <q>You have revealed them unto babes,</q> He signifies this also to pertain to Himself; for <q>neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> any man the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> says He, save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and he to whomsoever the Son is willing to reveal Him; <span class="stiki" id="note201626"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> not <q>to whomsoever He may be enjoined,</q> <q>to whomsoever He may be commanded.</q> But if He reveals Him, then Himself too. This however He let pass as acknowledged, but the other He has set down. And everywhere He affirms this; as when He says, <q>No man comes unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but by me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201627"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> </p>

<p>And thereby he establishes another point also, His being in harmony and of one mind with Him. <q>Why,</q> says He, <q>I am so far from fighting and warring with Him, that no one can even come to Him but by me.</q> For because this most offended them, His seeming to be a rival <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He by all means does away with this; and interested Himself about this not less earnestly, but even more so, than about His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>.</p>

<p>But when He says, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> any man the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, save the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> He means not this, that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Him, but that with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> wherewith He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>  Him, no man is acquainted with Him; which may be said of the Son too.  For it was not of some God unknown, and revealed to no man, that He was so speaking, as <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> says; but it is the perfection of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that He is here intimating, since neither do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Son as He should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; and this very thing, to add no more, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was declaring, when he said, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part, and we prophesy in part.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201631"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:9</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Next, having brought them by His words to an earnest desire, and having signified His unspeakable power, He after that invites them, saying, <q>Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201632"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28</a></span> Not this or that person, but all that are in anxiety, in sorrows, in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Come, not that I may call you to account, but that I may do away your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; come, not that I want your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but that I want your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <q>For I,</q> says He, <q>will give you rest.</q> He said not, <q>I will save you,</q> only; but what was much more, <q>I will place you in all security.</q></p>

<p><q>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart; and you shall find rest unto your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201633"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;11:29-30</a></span> Thus, <q>be not afraid,</q> says He, hearing of a yoke, for it is easy: <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not, because I said, <q>a burden,</q> for it is light.</p>

<p>And how said He before, <q>The gate is  narrow and the way strait?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201634"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;7:13</a></span> Whilst you are careless, while you are supine; whereas, if you duly perform His words, the burden will be light; wherefore also He has now called it so.</p>

<p>But how are they duly performed? If you have become lowly, and meek, and gentle. For this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the mother of all strictness of life. Wherefore also, when beginning those divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, with this He began. <span class="stiki" id="note201635"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3</a></span> And here again He does the very same, and exceeding great is the reward He appoints. <q>For not to another only do you become serviceable; but yourself also above all you refresh,</q> says He. <q>For you shall find rest unto your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q></p>

<p>Even before the things to come, He gives you here your recompense, and bestows the prize already, making the saying acceptable, both hereby, and by setting Himself forward as an example. For, <q>Of what are you afraid?</q> says He, <q>lest you should be a loser by your low estate? Look to me, and to all that is mine; learn of me, and then shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> distinctly how great your blessing.</q> Do you see how in all ways He is leading them to humility? By His own doings: <q>Learn of me, for I am meek.</q> By what themselves are to gain; for, <q>You shall find,</q> says He, rest unto your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. By what He bestows on them; for, <q>I too will refresh you,</q> says He. By rendering it light; <q>For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</q> So likewise does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, saying, <q>For the present light affliction, which is but for a moment, works a far more exceeding and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> weight of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201636"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:17</a></span> </p>

<p>And how, some one may say, is the burden light, when He says, <q>Except one <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> father and mother;</q> and, <q>Whosoever takes not up his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me:</q> and, <q>Whosoever forsakes not all that he has, cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>:</q> when He commands even to give up our very life? <span class="stiki" id="note201638"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;16:25</a></span> Let <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> teach you, saying, <q>Who shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? <span class="stiki" id="note201639"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;8:35</a></span> </q> And that, <q>The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that shall be revealed in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201640"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;8:18</a></span> Let those teach you, who return from the council of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> after plenty of stripes, and <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201641"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse41">Acts&nbsp;5:41</a></span> And if you are still afraid and tremblest at hearing of the yoke and the burden, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> comes not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing, but of your remissness; since if you are prepared, and in earnest, all will be easy to you and light. Since for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Christ also, to signify that we too must needs labor ourselves, did not mention the gracious things only, and then hold His peace, nor the painful things only, but set down both. Thus He both spoke of <q>a yoke,</q> and called it <q>easy;</q> both named a burden, and added that it was <q>light;</q> that you should neither flee from them as toilsome, nor despise them as over easy.</p>

<p>But if even after all this, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> seem to you an irksome thing, consider that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is more irksome. And this very thing He was intimating, in that He said not first, <q>Take my yoke upon you,</q> but before that, <q>Come, you that labor and are heavy laden;</q> implying that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> too has labor, and a burden that is heavy and hard to bear. For He said not only, <q>You that labor,</q> but also, <q>that are heavy laden.</q> This the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> too was speaking of, when in that description of her nature, <q>As an heavy burden they weighed heavy upon me.</q>  And Zacharias too, describing her, says she is <q>A talent of lead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201643"><a href="../bible/zec005.htm#verse7">Zechariah&nbsp;5:7-8</a></span> </p>

<p>And this moreover experience itself proves. For nothing so weighs upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and presses it down, as consciousness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; nothing so much gives it wings, and raises it on high, as the attainment of righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>And mark it: what is more grievous, I pray you, than to have no possessions? To turn the cheek, and when smitten not to smite again? To die by a violent death? Yet nevertheless, if we practise self-command, all these things are light and easy, and pleasurable.</p>

<p>But be not disturbed; rather let us take up each of these, and inquire about it accurately; and if you will, that first which many count most painful. Which then of the two, tell me, is grievous and burdensome, to be in care for one belly, or to be anxious about ten thousand? To be clothed with one outer garment, and seek for nothing more; or having many in one's house, to bemoan one's self every day and night in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, in trembling, about the preservation of them, grieved, and ready to choke about the loss of them; lest one should be moth-eaten, lest a servant purloin and go off with them?</p>

<p>4. But whatever I may say, my speech will present no such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> as the actual trial. Wherefore I would there were present here with us some one of those who have attained unto that summit of self-restraint, and then  you would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> assuredly the delight thereof; and that none of those that are enamored of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty would accept <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, though ten thousand were to offer it.</p>

<p>But would these, say you, ever consent to become poor, and to cast away the anxieties which they have? And what of that? This is but a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and grievous disease, not of anything very pleasurable in the thing. And this even themselves would testify to us, who are daily lamenting over these their anxieties, and accounting their life to be not worth living. But not so those others; rather they laugh, leap for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and the wearers of the diadem do not so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as they do in their poverty.</p>

<p>Again, to turn the cheek is, to him that gives heed, a less grievous thing than to smite another; for from this the contest has beginning, in that termination: and whereas by the former you have kindled the other's pile too, by the latter you have quenched even your own flames. But that not to be burnt is a pleasanter thing than to be burnt, is surely plain to every man. And if this hold in regard of bodies, much more in a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>And whether is lighter, to contend, or to be crowned? To fight, or to have the prize? And to endure waves, or to run into harbor? Therefore also, to die is better than to live. For the one withdraws us from waves and dangers, while the other adds unto them, and makes a man subject to numberless plots and distresses, which have made life not worth living in your account.</p>

<p>And if you disbelieve our sayings, hearken to them that have seen the countenances of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> in the time of their conflicts, how when scourged and flayed, they were exceeding joyful and glad, and when exposed upon hot irons, rejoiced, and were glad of heart, more than such as lie upon a bed of roses. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also said, when he was at the point of departing hence, and closing his life by a violent death, <q>I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with you all; for the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also do ye <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with me.</q>  Do you see with what exceeding strength of language he invites the whole world to partake in his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>? So great a good did he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his departure hence to be, so desirable, and lovely, and worthy of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that formidable thing, death.</p>

<p>5. But that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> yoke is sweet and light, is manifest many other ways also; but to conclude, if you please, let us look also at the burdens of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Let us then bring forward the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, the retailers and second-hand dealers in shameless bargains. What now could be a heavier burden than such transactions? How many sorrows, how many anxieties, how many disappointments, how many dangers, how many plots and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, daily spring up from these gains? How many troubles and disturbances? For as one can never see the sea without waves, so neither such a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> without anxiety, and despondency, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and disturbance; yea, the second overtakes the first, and again others come up, and when these are not yet ceased, others come to a head.</p>

<p>Or would you see the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the revilers, and of the passionate? Why, what is worse than this torture? What, than the wounds they have within? What, than the furnace that is continually burning, and the flame that is never quenched?</p>

<p>Or of the sensual, and of such as cleave unto this present life? Why, what more grievous than this bondage? They live the life of Cain, dwelling in continual trembling and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> at every death that happens; the kinsmen of the dead mourn not so much, as these do for their own end.</p>

<p>What again fuller of turmoil, and more frantic, than such as are puffed up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>? <q>For learn,</q> says He, <q>of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest unto your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> Because long-suffering is the mother of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</p>

<p>Fear thou not therefore, neither start away from the yoke that lightens you of all these things, but put yourself under it with all forwardness, and then you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well the pleasure thereof. For it does not at all bruise your neck, but is put on you for good order's sake only, and to persuade you to walk seemly, and to lead you unto the royal road, and to deliver you from the precipices on either side, and to make you walk with ease in the narrow way.</p>

<p>Since then so great are its benefits, so great its security, so great its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, let us with all our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, with all our diligence, draw this yoke; that we may both here <q>find rest unto our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>,</q> and attain unto the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
