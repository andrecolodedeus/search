<h1>Homily 3 on First Thessalonians</h1>

<p class="c12"><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse9">1 Thessalonians 2:9-12</a></span> </p>

<p><q>For you remember, brethren, our labor and travail: for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how we dealt with each one of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying, to the end that you should walk worthily of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who calls you into His own kingdom and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q></p>

<p>The teacher ought to do nothing with a feeling of being burdened, that tends to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For if the blessed Jacob was buffeted night and day in keeping his flocks, much more ought he, to whom the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is entrusted, to endure all toils, though the work be laborious and mean, looking only to one thing, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> thence arising to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. See then, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a man that was a Preacher, an Apostle of the world, and raised to so great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, worked with his hands that he might not be burdensome to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</p>

<p><q>For you remember,</q> he says, <q>my brethren, our labor and travail.</q> He had said previously, <q>we might have been burdensome as the Apostles of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> as he also says in the Epistle to the Corinthians, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they which minister about sacred things eat of the things of the Temple? Even so also did Christ ordain that they which proclaim the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> should live of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a></span> But I, he says, would not, but I labored; and he did not merely work, but with much diligence. Observe then what he says; <q>For you remember,</q> he has not said, the benefits received from me, but, <q>our labor and travail: for working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And to the Corinthians he said a different thing, <q>I <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> other Churches, taking wages of them that I might minister unto you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 11:8</a></span> And yet even there he worked, but of this he made no mention, but urged what was more striking,  as if he had said, I was maintained by others when ministering to you. But here it is not so. But what? <q>Working night and day.</q> And there indeed he says, <q>And when I was present with you, and was in want, I was not a burden on any man,</q> and, <q>I took wages that I might minister unto you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse8">2 Corinthians 11:8-9</a></span> And here he shows that the men were in poverty, but there it was not so.</p>

<p>On this account he frequently addresses them as witnesses. For <q>you are witnesses,</q> he says, <q>and God also</q>; God was worthy to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but this other was that which most fully assured them. For that indeed was uncertain to those who were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it; but this was without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to all. For do not enquire whether it was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who said these things. Much beyond what was necessary he gives them assurance. Wherefore he says, <q>You are witnesses, and God also, how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> It was proper to praise them again. On this account he sets these things before them, which were sufficient to persuade them. For he that stood there in want, and did not receive anything, would much more not receive anything now. <q>How holily,</q> says he, <q>and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q></p>

<p><q>As ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how we exhorted and comforted each one of you, as a father does his own children.</q> Above having spoken of his behavior here he speaks of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which was more than what belonged to his rule over them. And what is said marks his freedom from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. <q>As a father his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying, to the end that you should walk worthily of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who calls you into His own kingdom and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> When he says, <q>and testifying,</q> then he makes mention of <q>fathers</q>; although we testified, it was not violently, but like fathers. <q>Each one of you.</q> Strange! In so great a multitude to omit no one, neither small nor great, neither rich nor poor. <q>Exhorting</q> you, he says; to bear. <q>And comforting and testifying.</q> <q>Exhorting,</q>  therefore they did not seek <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; and <q>testifying,</q> therefore they did not flatter. <q>That ye should walk worthily of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who calls you into His own kingdom and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> Observe again, how, in relating, he both teaches and comforts. For if He has called them unto His kingdom, if He called them unto <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, they ought to endure all things. We <q>entreat</q>  you, not that you should grant us any favor, but that you should gain the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse13">Ver. 13</a>. <q>And for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we also thank God without ceasing, that when you received from us the word of the message, even the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you accepted it not as the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but as it is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which also works in you that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q></p>

<p>It cannot be said, he says, that we indeed do all things unblamably, but you on the other hand have done things unworthy of our course of life. For in hearing us, you gave such heed as if not hearing men, but as if God Himself were exhorting you. Whence is this manifest? Because as he shows from his own <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> and their testimony, and the way in which he acted, that he did not preach with flattery or vainglory; so from their trials, he shows also that they rightly received the word. For whence, he says, unless ye had heard as if God were speaking, did ye endure such perils? And observe his dignity.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse14">Ver. 14, 15, 16</a>. <q>For you, brethren, became imitators of the Churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which are in Jud&aelig;a in Christ Jesus: for you also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and drove out us, and please not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are contrary to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; forbidding us to speak to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> that they may be saved; to fill up their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> always: but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> has come upon them to the uttermost.</q></p>

<p><q>For you,</q> he says, <q>became imitators of the Churches of God which are in Jud&aelig;a.</q> This is a great consolation. It is no wonder, he says, that they should do these things to you, inasmuch as they have done it also to their own countrymen. And this too is no little <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the Preaching is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that even <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were able to endure all things. <q>For you also,</q> he says, <q>have suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> There is something more in his saying, <q>as they also did in Jud&aelig;a</q>; it shows that everywhere they rejoiced, as having nobly contended. He says therefore, <q>that you also suffered the same things.</q> And again, what wonder is it, if to you also, when even to the Lord they dared do such things?</p>

<p>Do you see how he introduces this as containing great consolation? And constantly he adverts to it; and upon a close examination one may find it in nearly all his Epistles, how variously,  upon all occasions of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, he brings forward Christ. Observe accordingly, that here also, when accusing the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he puts them in mind of the Lord, and of the sufferings of the Lord; so well does he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this is a matter of the greatest consolation.</p>

<p><q>Who both killed the Lord,</q> he says&mdash; but, perhaps, they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him&mdash;assuredly they did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. What then? Did they not slay and stone their own <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, whose books even they carry about with them? And they did not do this for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. There is therefore not only a consolation under the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, but they are reminded not to think that (the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>) did it for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> sake, and be troubled on that account. <q>And drove out us,</q>  he says. And we also, he says, have suffered numberless <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. <q>And please not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are contrary to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; forbidding us to speak to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that they may be saved.</q> <q>Contrary to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> he says. How? Because if we ought to speak to the world, and they forbid us, they are the common enemies of the world. They have slain Christ and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, they insult <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are the common enemies of the world, they banish us, when coming for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. What wonder if they have done such things also to you, when they have done them even in Jud&aelig;a? <q>Forbidding us to speak to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that they might be saved.</q> It is a mark of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> therefore to hinder the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all. <q>To fill up their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> always. But the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> has come upon them to the uttermost.</q> What is <q>to the uttermost</q>? These things are no longer like the former. There is here no return back, no limit. But the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is near at hand. Whence is this manifest? From that which Christ foretold. For not only is it a consolation to have partakers in our afflictions, but to hear also that our persecutors are to be punished. And if the delay is a grievance, let it be a consolation that they will never lift up their heads again; or rather he has cut short the delay, by saying, <q>THE <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>,</q> showing that it was long ago due, and predetermined, and predicted.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse17">Ver. 17</a>. <q>But we, being taken from you  for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavored the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.</q></p>

<p>He has not said <q>separated,</q> but what was much more.  He had spoken above of flattery, showing that he did not flatter, that he did not seek <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. He speaks here concerning <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Because he had said above, <q>as a father his children,</q> <q>as a nurse,</q> here he uses another expression, <q>being made <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>,</q> which is said of children who have lost their fathers. And yet they  were made <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. <q>No</q>&mdash; he says&mdash; <q>but we. For if any one should examine our longing, even as little children without a protector, having sustained an untimely bereavement, long for their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, not only from the feelings of nature itself, but also on account of their deserted state, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> do we too feel.</q> From this also he shows his own despondency on account of their separation. And this we cannot say, he says, that we have waited a long period, but <q>for a short time,</q> and that <q>in presence, not in heart.</q> For we always have you in our mind. See how great is his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>! Although having them always in his heart, he sought also their presence face to face. Tell me not of your superlative  <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>! This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> fervent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; both to see, and to hear, and speak; and this may be of much advantage. <q>We endeavored the more exceedingly.</q> What is <q>more exceedingly</q>? He either means to say, <q>we are vehemently attached to you,</q> or, <q>as was likely, being bereaved for a season, we endeavored to see your face.</q> Observe the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>. When of himself he cannot satisfy his longing, he does it through others, as when he sends Timothy to the Philippians, and the same person again to the Corinthians, holding intercourse with them through others, when he cannot of himself. For in loving them, he was like some mad person, not to be restrained, nor to command himself in his affection.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse18">Ver. 18</a>. <q>Wherefore we would fain have come unto you.</q></p>

<p>Which is the part of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; yet here he mentions no other necessity but <q>that we might see you.</q> <q>I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> once and again, and <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> hindered us.</q></p>

<p>What do you say? Does <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> hinder? Yes, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, for this was not the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in the Epistle to the Romans, he says this, that God hindered him <span class="stiki">from <a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse22">Romans 15:22</a></span>; and elsewhere Luke says, that <q>the Spirit</q> hindered them from going into Asia. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse7">Acts 16:7</a></span> And in the Epistle to the Corinthians he says, that it is the work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but here only of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. But what hindrance of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> is he speaking of? Some unexpected and violent <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>:  for a plot, it says, being formed against him by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he was detained three months in Greece. But it is another thing to remain for the sake of the dispensation, and willingly. For there he says, <q>Wherefore having no more place in these parts</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse23">Romans 15:23</a></span>, and, <q>To spare you I forbare to come unto <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse23">2 Corinthians 1:23</a></span> But here nothing of this sort. But what? That <q><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> hindered</q> him. <q>Even I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,</q> he says, <q>both once and again.</q> Observe, how ambitious he is, and what a display he makes, in his willingness to show that he loved them most of all. <q>I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,</q> he says, instead of Although no others. For they indeed were only willing, but I even attempted it.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse19">Ver. 19</a>. <q>For what is our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye before our Lord Jesus at His coming?</q></p>

<p>Are the Macedonians, tell me, your hope, O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>? Not these alone, he says. Therefore he has added, <q>Are you not also?</q> For <q>what,</q> he says, <q>is our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, or crown of glorying</q>? Observe then the words, which are those of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, inflamed with tenderness, talking to their little children. <q>And crown of glorying,</q> he says. For the name of <q>crown</q> was not sufficient to express the splendor, but also <q>of glorying.</q> Of what fiery warmth is this! Never could either mother, or father, yea if they even met together, and commingled their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, have shown their own affection to be equivalent to that of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. <q>My <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and crown,</q> he says, that is, I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in you more than in a crown. For consider how great a thing it is, that an entire Church should be present, planted and rooted by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Who would not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in such a multitude of children, and in the goodness of those children? So that this also is not flattery. For he has not said <q>ye,</q> but <q>ye also</q>  together with the others.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse20">Ver. 20</a>. <q>For you are our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q></p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Chap. 3:1, 2. <q>Wherefore, when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone.</q> Instead of saying, <q>we chose.</q> <q>And sent Timothy, our brother and God's minister and our fellow-worker in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>And this he says, not as extolling Timothy, but honoring them, that he sent them the fellow-worker, and minister of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. As if he had said, Having withdrawn him from his labors we have sent to you the minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and our fellow-laborer in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p><q>To establish you, and to comfort you concerning your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th003.htm#verse3">Ver. 3</a>. <q>That no man be moved by these afflictions.</q></p>

<p>What then does he say here? Because the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the teachers trouble their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and he had then fallen into many <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, as also he himself says, that <q><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> hindered us,</q> always saying this; <q>both once,</q> he says, <q>and again I would have come to you,</q> and was not able, which was a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of great <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. And it was reasonable that this should trouble them, for they are not so much troubled at their own <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, as at those of their teachers; as neither is the soldier so much troubled at his own trials,  as when he sees his general wounded. <q>To establish you,</q> he says; not that they were at all deficient in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor that they required to learn anything.</p>

<p><q>And to comfort you concerning your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that hereunto we are appointed.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/1th003.htm#verse4">Ver. 4</a>. <q>For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q></p>

<p>You ought not, he says, to be troubled, for nothing strange, nothing contrary to expectation is happening; which was sufficient to raise them up. For do you see that on this account also Christ foretold to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>? For hear Him saying, <q>Now I have told you before it came to pass, that when it has come to pass ye may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse29">John 14:29</a></span> For greatly indeed, greatly does it tend to the comfort of others, to have heard from their teachers what is to happen. For as he that is sick, if he hear from his physician that this or that is taking place, is not much troubled; but if anything happen unexpectedly, as if he too were at a loss, and the disorder was beyond his art, he is afflicted and troubled; so also is it here. Which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> foreknowing, foretold to them, <q>we are about to be afflicted,</q> <q>as it came to pass, and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> He not only says that this came to pass, but that he foretold many things, and they happened. <q>Hereunto we are appointed.</q> So that not only ye ought not to be troubled and disturbed about the past, but not even about the future, if any such thing should happen, <q>for hereunto we are appointed.</q></p>

<p>Moral . Let us hear, who have ears to hear. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is appointed hereunto. For concerning all the faithful is this said, <q>Hereunto we are appointed.</q> And we, as if we were appointed  for ease, think it strange if we suffer anything; and yet what reason have we for thinking anything strange? For no season of affliction or <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> has overtaken us, but what is common to man. It is a fit season for us to say to you, <q>You have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse4">Hebrews 12:4</a></span>. Or rather, this is not seasonable for us to say to you&mdash; but what? You have not yet despised riches. For to them indeed these words were said with reason, when they had lost all their own possessions,  but this is said to those who retain theirs. Who has been <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> of his riches for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake? Who has been beaten? Who has been insulted? Even in words, I mean. What have you to boast of? What confidence have you to say anything? So many things Christ suffered for us when we were enemies. What can we show that we have suffered for Him? Nothing that we have suffered indeed, but <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that we have received from Him. Whence shall we have confidence in that Day? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that the soldier too, when he can show numberless wounds and scars, will then be able to shine in the presence of the king? But if he has no good action to show, though he may have done no harm, he will take rank among the least.</p>

<p>But, you say, it is not the season of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. But if it was, tell me, who would contend? Who would attack? Who would break through  the phalanx? Perhaps no one. For when I see that you do not despise riches for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, how shall I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you will despise blows? Tell me, do you bear manfully those who insult you, and do you bless them? You do not&mdash; but you disobey. What is attended with no danger, you do not; and will you endure blows, in which there is much pain and suffering? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is proper in peace to keep up the exercises of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>?  Do you not see these  soldiers, who though no <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> disturbs them, but it is profound peace, brightening up their arms, and going forth with the teachers who teach them tactics, into the broad and level plains, I may say, every day, keep up with the greatest strictness the exercises of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>? Of our spiritual soldiers, who has done this? No one. For this reason we become in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> weak and ignoble, and easily led captive by any.</p>

<p>But what stupidity is this, not to think the present a season of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is crying out, <q>Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse12">2 Timothy 3:12</a></span>; and Christ says, <q>In the world you shall have tribulation.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a></span> And again the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> with a loud voice cries out, saying, <q>Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood,</q> and again, <q>Stand therefore, having girded your loins with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians 6:12-14</a></span> Why do you arm us, tell me, when it is not <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>? Why do you give us trouble to no purpose? You put breastplates on the soldiers, when it is allowed them to rest and revive. But he would have said, Certainly, however, though it were not <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, it would be right to attend to the concerns of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. For he who in peace considers the business of battle, will be formidable in the season of battle; but he who is without experience in the things of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, will be more troubled even in peace. Why so? Because he will weep for the things which he possesses, and not being able to fight for them, will be in anguish. For the possessions of the cowardly and inexperienced and ignoble in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, are the property of all who are brave and warlike. So that on this account first I arm you. But then also the whole time of our life is the season of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. How and in what respect? The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is ever at hand. Hear what it says, <q>As a roaring lion, he walks about, seeking whom he may devour.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1 Peter 5:8</a></span> Numberless bodily affections assail us, which it is necessary to enumerate, that we may not vainly deceive ourselves. For tell me, what does not <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against us? Riches, beauty, pleasure, power, authority, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>? For not only does our own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against us, forbidding us to descend to humility; but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of others also, leading us to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and ill-nature. But what do their opposites, poverty, dishonor, the being despised, rejected, the having no power? These things indeed are in us. But from men proceed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, plots, deceits, <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>, assaults innumerable. In like manner on the part of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, <q>principalities, powers, the world rulers of this darkness, spiritual hosts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> Some of us are rejoicing, others grieving, both are deviations from the right course. But health and sickness (<a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against us). From what quarter will not man be falling into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Would you that I should tell you from the beginning, commencing even immediately from Adam? What took captive the first created? Pleasure, and eating, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of dominion. What the son who came next after him? Grudging and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. What those in the time of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>? Fleshly pleasures, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> issuing from them. What his son? Insolence and irreverence. What the Sodomites? Insolence, wantonness; and fullness of bread. But often even poverty has this effect. On this account a certain wise man said, <q>Give me neither poverty nor riches.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse8">Proverbs 30:8</a></span> However it is neither poverty nor riches, but the will that cannot use either of them. <q>Acknowledge,</q> he says, <q>that you pass through the midst of snares.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir009.htm#verse13">Sirach 9:13</a></span></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> has admirably said, <q>Hereunto we are appointed.</q> He has not said merely, that we are tempted, but that <q>hereunto we are appointed,</q> as if he had said, For this were we born. This is our business, this our life, and do you seek rest? The executioner does not stand over us, lacerating our sides, and compelling us to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; but the desire of riches, and of possessing more, is instant, tearing out our eyes. No soldier has kindled a pile, nor placed us on a gridiron,  but more than this, the flames of the flesh set fire on our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. No king is present promising numberless bounties, and putting us out of countenance. But there is present a rage for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, tickling us worse than he. A great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, exceedingly great, if we would watch.</p>

<p>And the present season too has its crowns. Hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saying, <q>Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the righteous Judge shall give me...and not only to me, but also to all them that have loved His appearing.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse8">2 Timothy 4:8</a></span> When you have lost a beloved and only son, whom thou were bringing up in much <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, displaying good hopes, himself being the only one to succeed to your inheritance; do not complain, but give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and glorify Him who has taken him, and in this respect you will not be worse than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. For as he gave him to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he commanded it, so you have not complained, when He has taken him. Have you fallen into a severe sickness, and do many come, constraining you, some with charms, some with amulets, and others with other things, to remedy the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? And have you borne it firmly and unflinchingly from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and would you have chosen to suffer all things rather than submit to do any of those <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> practices? This brings to you the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Doubt it not. And how and by what means, I will tell you. For as such an one bears firmly the pains of torture, so as not to worship the image, so thou also bearest the sufferings of your disease, so as to want nothing of those remedies which the other offers, nor to do the things which he prescribes. <q>But those pains are more violent</q>&mdash; yes, but these are of longer duration, so that it is the same in the end; nay often these are more violent too. For tell me, when fever is raging and burning within, and you reject the charm that others recommend to you, have you not bound on you the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>?</p>

<p>Again, has any one lost money? Many advise you to have recourse to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>; but thou, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because it is forbidden, choosest rather not to receive your money than to disobey God&mdash; you have a reward equal to him who has given it to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, if having lost, you give thanks, and when able to have recourse to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, you bear not to receive, rather than so to receive it. For as he from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God has given all to the needy, so thou also from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when they have plundered you, hast not recovered it.</p>

<p>We are the masters of injuring or not injuring ourselves. And if you will, let us make the whole matter plain in the case of theft itself. The thief has cut through the wall, he has rushed into the chamber, he has carried off costly golden vessels, and precious stones, in short, he has cleared your whole treasure, and has not been taken. The fact is grievous, and it seems to be a loss; still as yet it is not so but it depends on you to make it either a loss or a gain. And how, do you say, can this be a gain? I will endeavor to show you how, if you are willing, it will be a great gain, but if unwilling, the loss will be severer than that which has taken place. For as in the case of artificers, when material is before them, he who is skilled in his art uses it to good purpose, but he that is unskillful spoils it, and makes it a loss to him, so also in these matters. How then will it be a gain? If you give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if you dost not wail bitterly, if you utter the words of Job, <q>The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Naked came I out of my mother's womb, naked shall I also go away.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job 1:21</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span></p>

<p><q>What?</q> do you say, <q>the Lord has taken away? The thief has taken away, and how can you say, the Lord has taken away?</q> Wonder not, for even Job, of things which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> took away, said, These the Lord has taken away? And shall not thou say of what the thief took, The Lord has taken away? Tell me, whom do you admire? Him who has bestowed all his goods upon the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, or Job for these words? Is he, who did not then give, inferior to him, who has given <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>? For say not, <q>I feel no thankfulness. The matter was not done with my consent, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or will. The robber took it. What will be my reward?</q> Neither did these things happen with Job's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or will. For how could it be? Nevertheless, he wrestled. </p>

<p>And it is in your power to receive as great a reward, as if you had cast it away willingly. And perhaps we admire this man more, who thankfully suffers wrongs, than him who gives spontaneously. And why? Because the latter indeed is fed with praises, and supported by <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and has good hopes; and having before  borne manfully the privation of his goods, he then cast them away; but the former, while yet bound to them, was forcibly deprived of them. And it is not the same thing, having first been induced to part with riches, in that way to bestow them, as it is while yet longing to be deprived of them. If you will say these words, you will receive many times as much, and even more than Job. For he received twice as much here, but to you Christ has promised a hundred fold. From the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>? You have not had recourse to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>? Suffering wrong, you have been thankful? You are like one who despises <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, for you could not do this, had you not first despised it. And it is not the same thing in a long time to practice the contempt of riches, and all at once to bear a loss that has happened. Thus the loss becomes gain, and you will not be injured, but even benefited by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>But how does the loss also become grievous? When you lose your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! Tell me, the thief has deprived you of your possessions: will you deprive yourself of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Wherefore, grieving at the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which you have suffered from others, do you plunge yourself into more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? He perhaps has involved you in poverty: but thou perversely injurest yourself in things that are fatal. He has deprived you of things that are without you, and that hereafter would spring away from you even against your will. But you deprive yourself of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> riches. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has grieved you by taking away your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; do thou also grieve him, and do not delight him. If you have recourse to <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, you delight him. If you render thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you give him his death-blow.</p>

<p>And see what happens. You will not still find it, if you go to the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, for it is not in their power to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; and even if by any chance they have told you, thou both losest your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> besides, and you will be derided by your brethren, and again wilt lose it wretchedly. For the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you can not bear your loss, but for the sake of these things deniest even your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, again gives you <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, that he may have an opportunity of deceiving you again, and making you fall away. And if the <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> should tell you, wonder not. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> is without body: he is everywhere going about. It is he who arms the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> themselves. For these things do not take place without the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>. If therefore he arms them, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also where it is deposited. He is not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his own ministers. And this is not wonderful. If he sees you grieving at the loss, he adds yet another to it. If he sees you laughing at it, and despising it, he will desist from this course. For as we deal to our enemies those things by which we grieve them, but if we see that they do not grieve, we henceforth desist, as being unable to plague them; so does the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> also.</p>

<p>What do you say? Do you not see those who sail on the sea, how, when a storm arises, they regard not their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, but even throw overboard their substance? <q>O man, what do you say? Are you co&ouml;perating with the storm and the shipwreck? Before the wave has taken away your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, do you do it with your own hands? Why, before the shipwreck, do you wreck yourself?</q> But indeed a rustic inexperienced in the trials of the sea might say this. But the naval man, and one who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what are the causes of calm, and what of storm, will even laugh at him who talks thus. For I throw it overboard, he says, that there may be no whelming sea.  So he who is experienced in the events and trials of life, when he sees the storm impending, and the spirits of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> wishing to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shipwreck, throws overboard even the remainder of his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. Have you been plundered? Do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, and you lighten the ship. Have <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> ravaged you? Give what remains to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. So you will console your poverty from your former loss. Lighten the ship, do not hold fast what remains, lest the vessel fill with water. They, to preserve their bodies, throw their goods overboard, and wait not for the assailing wave to overturn the vessel. And will you not stay the shipwreck, that you may save <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>?</p>

<p>Make the trial, I beseech you&mdash; if you disbelieve, make the trial, and you will see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When anything grievous has happened, immediately give <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; render thanks that it has happened, and you will see how much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> will come upon you. For spiritual gain, though it be small, is so great as to throw into the shade all bodily loss. As long as you have to give to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you are rich. Tell me, if when you were <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a>, the king coming to you held out his hand, begging to receive something from you, would you not then think yourself richer than all, if the king not even after so great poverty was ashamed of you? Be not carried away with your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, only overcome yourself, and you will overcome the assault of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. It is in your power to acquire great gain.</p>

<p>Let us despise <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, that we may not despise the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But how can any one despise it? Do you not see in the case of beautiful bodies, and the lovers of them, how as long as they are in their sight the fire is kindled, the flame rises bright; but when any one has removed them afar off, all is extinguished, all is lulled to sleep; so also in the case of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, let no one provide gold, nor precious stones, nor necklaces; when seen, they ensnare the eyes. But if you would be rich like the ancients, be rich not in gold, but in necessary things, that you may bestow on others from that which you have ready. Be not fond of ornament. Such <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is both easy to be plotted against by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and a thing that brings us cares. Not vessels of gold and silver, but let there be stores of bread and wine and oil, not that being sold again they may procure money, but that they may be supplied to those who need. If we withdraw ourselves from those superfluities, we shall obtain the heavenly goods; which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant that we may all obtain, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, with whom, etc.</p>
