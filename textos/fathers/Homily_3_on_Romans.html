<h1>Homily 3 on Romans</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse18">Rom. I. 18</a></p>

<p><q>For the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God is revealed from <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who hold down the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness.</q></p>

<p>Observe the discretion of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, how after encouraging by the gentler things, he turns his discourse to the more fearful. For after saying that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and of life, that it is the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that it genders <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and righteousness, he mentions what might well make them <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that were heedless of it. For since in general most men are not drawn so much by the promise of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> as by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of what is painful, he draws them on both sides. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> too did God not only promise a kingdom, but also threaten <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. And the Prophets spoke thus with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, ever intermingling the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with the good. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> too <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> thus varies his discourse, yet not any how, but he sets first the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and after the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, to show that the former came of the guiding purpose of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but the latter of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the backsliding. And in this way the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> puts the good first, saying, <q>If you be willing and will <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> me, you shall eat the good of the land: but if you be not willing and will not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> me, the sword shall devour you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse19">Isaiah 1:19-20</a></span> So here too does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> conduct his discourse. But observe him; Christ, he means, came to bring forgiveness, righteousness, life, yet not in any way, but by the Cross, which is greatest too and wonderful, that He not only gave such things, but that He also suffered such things. If then ye insolently scorn the gifts, then will the penalties await you. And see how he raises his language, <q>For the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he says, <q>is revealed from heaven.</q> Whence does this appear? If it be a believer who says this, we will tell him of the declarations of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but if the unbeliever and the Grecian, him <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> silences, by what he says presently of the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, bringing an uncontrovertible demonstration from the things which were done by them. And this too is by far the most striking point in him, how he exhibits those who speak against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as themselves bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> by the things which they do daily, and say, to the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But of this in the sequel: but for the present, let us keep to what is set before us. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God is revealed from heaven.</q> And indeed even here this often takes place in famines and pestilences and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>: for each individually and all in common are punished. What will be the new thing then? That the chastisement will be greater, and common to all, and not by the same rules. For now what takes place is for correction; but then for vengeance.  And this also St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> showed, when he said, <q>We are chastened now, that we should not be condemned with the world.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse32">1 Corinthians 11:32</a></span> And now indeed to many such things usually seem to come not of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> from above, but of the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of man. But then the punishment from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall be manifest, when the Judge, sitting upon the fearful tribunal, shall command some to be dragged to the furnaces, and some to the outer darkness,  and some to other inexorable and intolerable punishments. And why is it that he does not speak as plainly as this, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is coming with ten thousand <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and will call each man to account, but says, that <q>the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God is revealed?</q> His hearers were as yet novices, and therefore he draws them first by things quite allowed by them. And besides what is here mentioned, he also seems to me to be aiming against the Greeks. And this is why he makes his beginning from this, but afterwards he introduces the subject of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> judgment.</p>

<p><q>Against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness.</q> Here he shows that the ways of ungodliness are many, and that of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, one. For <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is a thing various and multiform and compound, but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is one. And after speaking of doctrines he speaks of life, mentioning the unrighteousness of men. For there be various kinds of unrighteousness also. One is in money affairs, as when any one deals unrighteously by his neighbor in these; and another in regard to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, when a man leaves his own wife, and breaks in upon the marriage of another. For St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> calls this also defrauding, saying thus, <q>That no man go beyond or defraud his brother in the matter.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse6">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a></span> Others again injure not the wife or property, but the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of their neighbor, and this too is unrighteousness. For <q>a good name is better than great riches.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro022.htm#verse1">Proverbs 22:1</a></span> But some say that this also is said of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> about doctrines. Still there is nothing to prevent its having been said of both. But what it is <q>to hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness,</q> learn from the sequel.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Ver. 19</a>. <q>Because that which may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of God is manifest in them, for God has showed it unto them.</q></p>

<p>But this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> they invested stocks and stones with. As then he which is entrusted with the goods of the king, and is ordered to spend them upon the king's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, if he waste these upon <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and harlots, and witches, and make these splendid out of the king's stores, he is punished as having done the kingdom the greatest wrong. Thus they also who after having received the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, invested <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> therewith, <q>held the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness,</q> and, at least as far as was in their power, dealt unrighteously by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by not using it upon fitting objects. Now, has what was said become clear to you, or must one make it still clearer? Perhaps it were needful to say somewhat more. What then is it which is here said? The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself God placed in men from the beginning. But this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they invested stocks and stones with, and so dealt unrighteously to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as far at least as they might. For it abides unchanged, having its own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> immutable. <q>And whence is it plain that He placed in them this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?</q> <q>Because,</q> says he, <q>that which may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Him is manifest in them.</q> This, however, is an assertion, not a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. But do thou make it good, and show me that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God was plain to them, and that they willingly turned aside. Whence was it plain then? Did He send them a voice from above? By no means. But what was able to draw them to Him more than a voice, that He did, by putting before them the Creation, so that both wise, and unlearned, and Scythian, and barbarian, having through sight learned the beauty of the things which were seen, might mount up to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Wherefore he says,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Ver. 20</a>. <q>For the invisible things of Him from the Creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made.</q></p>

<p>Which also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said, <q>The heavens declare the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa018.htm#verse1">Psalm 19:1</a></span> For what will the Greeks (i.e. Heathen) say in that day? That <q>we were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of You?</q> Did ye then not hear the heaven sending forth a voice by the sight, while the well-ordered harmony of all things spoke out more clearly than a trumpet? Did ye not see the hours of night and day abiding unmoved continually, the goodly order of winter, spring, and the other seasons remaining both sure and unmoved, the tractableness (<span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03B3;&#x03BD;&#x03C9;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F7B;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03BD;</span>) of the sea amid all its turbulence and waves? All things abiding in order and by their beauty and their grandeur, preaching aloud of the Creator? For all these things and more than these does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> sum up in saying, <q>The invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things which are made, even His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse.</q> And yet it is not for this God has made these things, even if this came of it. For it was not to bereave them of all excuse, that He set before them so great a system of teaching, but that they might come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. But by not having recognized  Him they deprived themselves of every excuse, and then to show how they are bereaved of excuse, he says,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse21">Ver. 21</a>. <q>Because that, when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>This is the one greatest charge; and the second after it is their also worshipping <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, as Jeremy too in accusing them said, <q>This people has committed two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: they have forsaken me the fountain of living water, and have dug for themselves broken cisterns.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah 2:13</a></span> And then as a sign of their having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not used their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> upon a fit object, he adduces this very thing, that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> gods. Wherefore he adds, <q>because that, when they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> Him not as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And he names the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> through which they fell into such senselessness. What then is it? They trusted everything to their reasonings. Still he does not word it so, but in a much sharper language, <q>but became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened.</q> For as in a night without a moon, if any one attempt to go by a strange road, or to sail over a strange sea, so far will he be from soon reaching his destination, that he will speedily be lost. Thus they, attempting to go the way leading to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and having destroyed the light from their own selves, and, in lieu of it, trusted themselves to the darkness of their own reasoning, and seeking in bodies for Him who is incorporeal, and in shapes for Him who has no shape, underwent a most rueful shipwreck. But beside what has been said, he names also another <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, when he says,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse22">Ver. 22</a>. <q>Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools.</q></p>

<p>For having some great conceit of themselves, and not enduring to go the way which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had commanded them, they were plunged into the reasonings of senselessness (1 manuscript <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>). And then to show and give in outline, what a rueful surge it was, and how destitute of excuse, he goes on to say,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse23">Ver. 23</a>. <q>And changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.</q></p>

<p>The first charge is, that they did not find <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the second was, that it was while they had great and clear (Sav. marg. <q>wise</q>) means to do it; the third, that withal they said they were wise; the fourth, that they not only did not find that Reverend Being, but even lowered Him to devils and to stones and stocks. Now he takes down their haughtiness also in the Epistle to the Corinthians, but not in the same way there as here. For there it is from the Cross he gives them the blow, saying, <q>The foolishness of God is wiser than men.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse25">1 Corinthians 1:25</a></span> But here, without any comparison, he holds their wisdom by itself up to ridicule, showing it to be folly and a mere display of vain boasting. Then, that you may learn that when they had the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God they gave it up thus treacherously, <q>they changed,</q> he says. Now he that changes, has something to change. For they wished to find out more, and not bear with the limits given them, and so they were banished from these also. For they were lusters after new devices, for such is all that is Grecian. And this is why they stood against one another and Aristotle rose up against <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> blustered (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x03C5;&#x1F71;&#x03BE;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;</span> 6 manuscripts <q>fenced themselves,</q> <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03C1;&#x1F71;&#x03BE;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;</span>: which Field inclines to prefer) against him, and one has become hostile to one, another to another. So that one should not so much marvel at them for their wisdom, as turn away from them indignant and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them, because through this very thing they have become fools. For had they not trusted what they have to reasonings, and syllogisms, and sophistries, they would not have suffered what they did suffer. Then, to strengthen the accusation against them he holds the whole of their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> up to ridicule. For in the first place the changing even were a very fit subject of scorn. But to change to such things too, is beyond all excuse. For what then did they change it, and what was it which they invested with His Glory? Some conceptions they ought to have had about Him, as, for instance, that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He is Lord of all, that He made them, which were not, that He exercises a Providence, that He cares for them. For these things are the <q>Glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> To whom then did they ascribe it? Not even to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but <q>to an image made like to corruptible man.</q> Neither did they stop here, but even dropped down to the brutes, or rather to the images of these. But consider, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, how he has taken the two extremes, God the Highest, and creeping things the lowest: or rather, not the creeping things, but the images of these; that he might clearly show their evident <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. For what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> they ought to have had concerning Him Who is incomparably more excellent than all, with that they invested what was incomparably more worthless than all. But what has this to do with the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>? A man may say. To these belongs most of all what I have said to do with them. For they have the Egyptians who were the inventors of these things to their masters. And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, who is thought more reverend than the rest of them, glories in these masters. (Plat. Tim. 21. B. etc.) And his master is in a stupid awe of these <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, for he it is that bids them <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the cock to &AElig;sculapius  (his last words, Ph&aelig;do), where (i.e. in his temple. So Field from manuscripts.) are the images of these beasts, and creeping things. And one may see Apollo and Bacchus worshipped along with these creeping things. And some of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> even lifted up to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> bulls, and scorpions, and dragons, and all the rest of that vanity. For in all parts did the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> strive to bring men down before the images of creeping things, and to range beneath the most senseless of all things, him whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has willed to lift up above the heavens. And it is not from this only, but also from other grounds, that you will see their chief man to come under the remarks now made. For having made a collection of the poets, and having said that we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them upon matters relating to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as having accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, he has nothing else to bring forward but the <q>linked sweetness</q> of these absurdities, and then says, that this utterly ludicrous trifling is to be held for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.  </p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse24">Ver. 24</a>. <q>Wherefore also God gave them up to uncleanness, through the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.</q></p>

<p>Hence he shows, that even of the perversion of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> it was ungodliness which was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but He <q>gave them up,</q> here is, let them alone.  For as he that has the command in an army, if upon the battle lying heavy upon him he retreat and go away, gives up his soldiers to the enemies not by thrusting them himself, but by stripping them of his own assistance; thus too did God leave those that were not minded to receive what comes from Him, but were the first to bound off from Him, though Himself having wholly fulfilled His own part. But consider; He set before them, for a form of doctrine, the world; He gave them reason, and an understanding capable of perceiving what was needful. None of these things did the men of that day use unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but they perverted to the opposite what they had received. What was to be done then? To drag them by compulsion and force? But this were not to make them <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>. It remained then, after that, for Him to leave them alone, and this He did too, that in this way, if by no other, having by trial come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the things they lusted after, they might flee from what was so shameful (3 manuscripts add <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03C4;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>, and with reason). For if any that was a king's son, dishonoring his father, should choose to be with <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> and murderers, and them that break up tombs, and prefer their doings to his father's house; the father leaves him, say, so that by actual trial, he may learn the extravagance of his own <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. But how comes he to mention no other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, for instance, or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, or other such besides, but only unchasteness? He seems to me to hint at his audience at the time, and those who were to receive the Epistle. <q>To uncleanness, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves.</q></p>

<p>Note the emphasis here, as it is most severe. For they stood not in need of any others, it means, to do insolent <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to them, but the very treatment the enemies would have shown them, this they did to themselves. And then, taking up the charge again, he says,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Ver. 25</a>. <q>Who changed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of God into a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator.</q></p>

<p>Things which were matter for utter scorn, he puts down specially, but what seemed of a graver cast than the rest, in general terms; and by all he shows, that serving the creature is Grecian. And see how strong he makes his assertion, for he does not say, barely, <q>they served the creature,</q> but <q>more than the Creator:</q> thus everywhere giving fresh force to the charge, and, by the comparison, taking from them all ground of mitigation. <q>Who is blessed forever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> But by this, he means, He was not any whit injured. For Himself abides <q>blessed for ever.</q> Here he shows, that it was not in self-defence that He left them alone, inasmuch as He suffered nothing Himself. For even if these treated Him insolently, yet He was not insolently treated, neither was any scathe done to the bearings of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but He abides continually blessed. For if it often happen, that man through <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> would not feel the insults men offered him, much less would <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the imperishable and unalterable Nature, the unchangeable and immovable Glory.</p>

<p>For men are in this respect made like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  when they do not feel what is inflicted by them who would do them despite, and are neither insulted of others who insult them, nor beaten of them when beating them, nor made scorn of when they make scorn of them. And how in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things can this be? It may be said. It is so, yea most certainly it is possible, when you are not vexed at what is done. And how, it may be said, is it possible not to be vexed? Nay rather, how is it possible to be vexed? Tell me now, if your little child were to insult you, would you then reckon the insult an insult? What, but would you be vexed? Surely not. But and if you were to be vexed, would you not then be ridiculous? Thus too let us then get to feel disposed towards our neighbors, and then we shall have no sense of displeasure. For they that insult us are more senseless than children. Neither let us even seek to be free from insults, but when we are insulted to bear them. For this is the only secure <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. But why so? Because this you are master of, but that, another person. Do you not see the adamant reverberating the blows it receives? But nature, you will say, gives it this property. Yet you too have it in your power to become by free choice such, as that happens to be by nature. How? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the children in the furnace were not burned? And that Daniel in the den suffered no harm? This may even now come to pass. There stand by us too lions, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, with fearful teeth tearing asunder him that falls among them. (<a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> <em>Rep.</em> viii.) Become then like that (<span class="greek">&#x1F14;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> 3 manuscripts) Daniel, and let not these affections fasten their fangs into your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But that, you will say, was wholly of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Yes; because the acts  of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> led the way thereto. So that if we be willing to train ourselves to a like character, even now the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is at hand. And even though the brutes be an hungered, yet will they not touch your sides. For if at the sight of a servant's body they were abashed, when they have seen the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, (and this is what we <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are,) how shall they do else than be still? Yet if they be not still, it is owing to the fault of those cast among them. For indeed many spend largely upon these lions, by keeping harlots, breaking through marriages, taking vengeance upon enemies. And so before ever they come to the bottom of the den they get torn in pieces. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm#verse24">Daniel 6:24</a></span> But with Daniel this did not so happen, neither yet would it with us, if we were so minded, but even a greater thing would take place than what then happened. For the lions hurt not him; and if we be sober-minded, then will they that hurt us even profit us. Thus then did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> grow bright out of those that thwarted him and plotted against him, thus Job out of the many scourges, thus Jeremy out of the miry pit, thus <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> out of the flood, thus Abel out of the treachery, thus <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> out of the bloodthirsty <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, thus, Elisha, thus each of the worthies of old, not out of relaxedness and softness, but out of tribulations and trials, came to be attired with their bright crowns. Wherefore also Christ, inasmuch as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this to be the groundwork of a good report, said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a></span> What then, they will say, Have not many been turned to flight by these terrors? Yes, but that was not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, but of their own remissness. But He that <q>with the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> makes also an escape, so that you may be able to bear it</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 10:13</a></span>, may He stand by all of us, and reach forth His hand, that being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> proclaimed victorious we may attain to the everlasting crowns, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man (5 manuscripts add the rest and so Field <em>passim</em>) of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through Whom, and with Whom, to the Father be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
