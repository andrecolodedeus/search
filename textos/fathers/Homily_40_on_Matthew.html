<h1>Homily 40 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Matthew 12:9-10.</strong></p>

<p><q>And when He was departed thence, He went into their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: and, behold, a man which had his hand withered.</q></p>

<p>Again He heals on a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, vindicating what had been done by His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> indeed say, that He <q>set</q> the man <q>in the midst,</q> and asked them, <q>If it was lawful to do good on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> days.</q>  </p>

<p>See the tender bowels of the Lord. <q>He set him in the midst,</q> that by the sight He might subdue them; that overcome by the spectacle they might cast away their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and out of a kind of shame towards the man, cease from their savage ways. But they, ungentle and inhuman, choose rather to hurt the fame of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, than to see this person made whole: in both ways betraying their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; by their warring against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and by their doing so with such contentiousness, as even to treat with despite His mercies to other men.</p>

<p>And while the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> say, He asked the question, this one says, it was asked of Him. <q>And they asked Him,</q> so it stands, <q>saying, Is it lawful to heal on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> days? That they might accuse Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201677"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;12:10</a></span> And it is likely that both took place. For being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> wretches, and well assured that He would doubtless proceed to the healing, they hastened to take Him beforehand with their question, thinking in this way to hinder Him. And this is why they asked, <q>Is it lawful to heal on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> days?</q> not for information, but that <q>they might accuse Him.</q> Yet surely the work was enough, if it were really their wish to accuse Him; but they desired to find a handle in His words too, preparing for themselves beforehand an abundance of arguments.</p>

<p>But He in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man does this also: He answers them, teaching His own meekness, and turning it all back upon them; and points out their inhumanity. And He <q>sets</q> the man <q>in the midst;</q> not in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of them, but endeavoring to profit them, and move them to pity.</p>

<p>But when not even so did He prevail with them, then was He grieved, it is said, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them for the hardness of their heart, and He says,</p>

<p><q>What man is there among you that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> days, will he not lay hold of it, and lift it out? How much then is a man better than a sheep?  Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> days.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201680"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;12:3</a></span> </p>

<p>Thus, lest they have ground of obstinacy, and of accusing him again of transgression, He convicts them by this example. And do thou mark, I pray you, how variously and suitably in each case, He introduces His pleas for the breaking of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>. Thus, first, in the case of the blind man, <span class="stiki" id="note201681"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;9:6</a></span> He does not so much as defend Himself to them, when He made the clay: and yet then also were they blaming Him; but the manner of the creation was enough to indicate the Lord and Owner of the law. Next, in the case of the paralytic, when he carried his bed, and they were finding fault, <span class="stiki" id="note201683"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;5:9-10</a></span> He defends Himself, now as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and now as man; as man, when He says, <q>If a man on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> receive <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, that the law should not be broken;</q> (and He said not <q>that a man should be profited</q>); <q>are you <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201684"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;7:23</a></span> As God again, when He says, <q>My Father works hitherto, and I work.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201685"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;5:17</a></span> </p>

<p>But when blamed for His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He said, <q>Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungered, himself and they that were with him, how he entered into the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and did eat the show-bread?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201686"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;12:3-4</a></span> He brings forward the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> also.</p>

<p>And here again; <q>Is it lawful to do good on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> days, or to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?  Which of you shall have one sheep?</q> For He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, that they were all  taken up with it, rather than with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. And indeed the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says, that He also looked about upon them when asking these questions, that by His very eye He might win them over; but not even so did they become better.</p>

<p>And yet here He speaks only; whereas elsewhere in many cases He heals by <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> also. But nevertheless none of these things made them meek; rather, while the man was healed, they by his health became worse.</p>

<p>For His desire indeed was to cure them before him, and He tried innumerable ways of healing, both by what He did in their presence, and by what He said: but since their malady after all was incurable, He proceeded to the work. <q>Then says He to the man, Stretch forth your hand. And he stretched it forth, and it was restored whole, like as the other.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201689"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;12:13</a></span> </p>

<p>2. What then did they? They go forth, it is said, and take counsel together to slay Him. For <q>the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>went out and held a council against Him, how they might destroy Him.</q>  They had received no injury, yet they went about to slay Him. So great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. For not against strangers only, but even against our own, is it ever warring. And Mark says, they took this counsel with the Herodians. <span class="stiki" id="note201691"><a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse6">Mark&nbsp;3:6</a></span> </p>

<p>What then does the gentle and meek One? He withdrew, on being aware of it. <q>But when Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their devices,  He withdrew Himself,</q> it is said, <q>from them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201693"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;12:15</a></span> Where now are they who say, <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> ought to be done? Nay, by these things He signified, that the uncandid <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not even thereby persuaded; and He made it plain that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> too were blamed by them without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. This however we should observe, that they grow fierce especially at the benefits done to their neighbors; and when they see any one delivered either from disease or from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, then is the time for them to find fault, and become wild beasts. Thus did they <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> Him, both when He was about to save the harlot, and when He was eating with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, and now again, when they saw the hand restored.</p>

<p>But do thou observe, I pray you, how He neither desists from His tender care over the infirm, and yet allays their <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. <q>And great multitudes followed Him, and He healed them all; and He charged them that were healed, that they should make Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to no man.</q>  Because, while the multitudes everywhere both admire and follow Him, they desist not from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>Then, lest you should be confounded at what is going on, and at their strange frenzy, He introduces the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also, foretelling all this. For so great was the accuracy of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, that they omit not even these things, but foretell His very journeyings, and changes of place, and the intent with which He acted therein; that you might learn, how they spoke all by the Spirit. For if the secrets of men cannot by any art be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, much more were it impossible to learn Christ's purpose, except the Spirit revealed it. <span class="stiki" id="note201696"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> </p>

<p>What then says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? Nay, it is subjoined: <q>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying, Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon Him, and He shall show judgment to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall any man hear His voice in the streets. A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall He not quench, till He send forth judgment unto victory. And in His name shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> trust.</q>  </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> celebrates His meekness, and His unspeakable power, and opens to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <q>a great door and effectual;</q> he foretells also the ills that are to overtake the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and signifies His unanimity with the Father. For <q>behold,</q> says He, <q>my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is well pleased.</q> Now if He chose Him, not as an adversary does Christ set aside the law, nor as being an enemy of the lawgiver, but as having the same mind with Him, and the same objects.</p>

<p>Then proclaiming His meekness, he says, <q>He shall not strive nor cry.</q> For His desire indeed was to heal in their presence; but since they thrust Him away, not even against this did He contend.</p>

<p>And intimating both His might, and their weakness, he says, <q>A bruised reed shall He not break.</q> For indeed it was easy to break them all to pieces like a reed, and not a reed merely, but one already bruised.</p>

<p><q>And smoking flax shall He not quench.</q> Here he sets forth both their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> that is kindled, and His might that is able to put  down their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and to quench it with all ease; whereby His great mildness is signified.</p>

<p>What then? Shall these things always be? And will He endure them perpetually, forming such frantic plots against Him? Far from it; but when He has performed His part, then shall He execute the other purposes also. For this He declared by saying <q>Till He send forth judgment unto victory: and in His name shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> trust.</q> As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> likewise says, <q>Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is fulfilled.</q>  </p>

<p>But what is, <q>when He sends forth judgment unto victory?</q> When He has fulfilled all His own part, then, we are told, He will bring down upon them His vengeance also, and that a perfect vengeance. Then shall they suffer His terrors, when His trophy is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> set up, and the ordinances that proceed from Him have prevailed, and He has left them no plea of contradiction, however shameless. For He is wont to call righteousness, <q>judgment.</q></p>

<p>But not to this will His dispensation be confined, to the punishment of unbelievers only, but He will also win to Himself the whole world. Wherefore He added, <q>And in His name shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> trust.</q></p>

<p>Then, to inform you that this too is according to the purpose of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in the beginning the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had assured us of this likewise, together with what had gone before; saying, <q>My well-beloved, in whom my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is well pleased.</q> For of the well-beloved it is quite evident that He did these things also according to the mind of the beloved. </p>

<p>3. <q>Then they brought unto Him one possessed with a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, blind and dumb, and He healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.</q> </p>

<p>O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit! He had barred up both entrances, whereby that person should have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, as well sight as hearing; nevertheless, both did Christ open.</p>

<p><q>And all the people were amazed, saying, Is not this the Son of David?  But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> said, This fellow does  not cast out devils, but by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the prince of the devils.</q> </p>

<p>And yet what great thing had been said? Nevertheless, not even this did they endure: to such a degree, as I have already remarked, are they ever stung by the good works done to their neighbors, and nothing grieves them so much as the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men. And yet He had actually retired, and had given room for their passion to subside; but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> was again rekindled, because a benefit was again conferred; and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit was not so indignant as they. For he indeed departed from the body, and gave place and fled away, uttering no sound; but these were endeavoring now to slay, now to defame Him. That is, their first aim not succeeding, they would fain hurt His good name.</p>

<p>Such a thing is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, than which no worse <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> can exist. For the adulterer indeed enjoys some pleasure, such as it is, and in a short time accomplishes his proper <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> man punishes himself, and takes vengeance upon himself more than on the person whom he envies, and never ceases from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but is continually engaged in the commission thereof. For as a sow in mire, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> in our hurt, so also does he delight in his neighbor's ills; and if anything painful take place, then is he refreshed, and takes breath; accounting the calamities of others his own joys, and the blessings of others his own ills; and he considers not what pleasure may accrue to himself, but what pain to his neighbor. These men therefore were it not meet to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> and beat to death, like mad dogs, like destroying <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, like the very furies?</p>

<p>For as beetles feed on dung, so do these men on the calamities of others, being a sort of common foes and enemies of our nature. And whereas the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> pity even a brute when it is killed, do you, on seeing a man receive benefits, become like a wild beast, tremble, and turn pale? Why, what can be worse than this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>? Therefore, you see, whoremongers and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> were able to enter into the kingdom, but the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, being within it, went out: For <q>the children of the kingdom,</q> it is said, <q>shall be cast out.</q>  And the former, once freed from their present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, attained to things which they never looked for, while these latter lost even the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which they had; and very reasonably. For this turns a man into a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, this renders one a savage <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>. Thus did the first <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> arise; thus was nature forgotten; thus the earth defiled; thus afterwards did it open its mouth, to receive yet living, and utterly destroy, Dathan, and Korah, and Abiram, and all that multitude. </p> 

<p>4. But to declaim against <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, one may say, is easy; but we ought to consider also how men are to be freed from the disease. How then are we to be rid of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? If we bear in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that as he who has committed fornication cannot lawfully enter the church, so neither he that envies; nay, and much less the latter than the former. For as things are, it is accounted even an indifferent thing; wherefore also it is little thought of; but if its real badness be made evident, we should easily refrain from it.</p>

<p>Weep then, and groan; lament, and entreat God. Learn to feel and to repent for it, as for a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And if you be of this <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, you will quickly be rid of the disease.</p>

<p>And who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, one may say, that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing? No one indeed is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it: yet they have not the same estimation of this passion as of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication. When, at least, did any one condemn himself bitterly for having envied? When did he entreat God concerning this pest, that He would be merciful to him? No man at any time: but if he shall fast and give a little money to a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man, though he be <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> to the thousandth degree, he counts himself to have done nothing horrid, held as he is in subjection by the most accursed passion of all. Whence, for example, did Cain become such as he was? Whence <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>? Whence the children of Laban? Whence the sons of Jacob? Whence Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with their company? Whence Miriam? Whence <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>? Whence the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself?</p>

<p>Herewith consider this also; that you injure not him whom you envy, but into yourself you are thrusting the sword. For wherein did Cain injure Abel? Did he not even against his own will send him the more quickly into the kingdom? But himself he pierced through with innumerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Wherein did <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> harm Jacob? Did not Jacob grow <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, and enjoy unnumbered blessings; while he himself both became an outcast from his father's house, and wandered in a strange land, after that plot of his?  And wherein did Jacob's sons again make Joseph the worse, and this, though they proceeded even unto blood? Had not they to endure famine, and encounter peril to the utmost, whereas he became king of all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>? For the more you envy, the more do you become a procurer of greater blessing to the object of your <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. For there is a God who beholds these things; and when He sees him injured, that does no injury, him He exalts the more, and so makes him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, but you He punishes.</p>

<p>For if them that exult over their enemies, He suffer not to go unpunished (<q>For <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> not,</q> it is said, <q>when your enemies fall, lest at any time the Lord see it, and it displease Him</q> ); much more such as <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> those who have done no wrong.</p>

<p>Let us then extirpate the many-headed wild beast. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> many are the kinds of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Thus, if he that loves one that is a friend to him has no more than the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>,  where shall he stand who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> him that does him no wrong? And how shall he escape <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,  becoming worse than the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>? Wherefore also I do exceedingly grieve, that we who are commanded to copy the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, or rather the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, emulate the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For indeed there is much <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, even in the church; and more among us, than among those under authority. Wherefore we must even discourse unto ourselves.</p>

<p>5. Tell me then, why do you <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> your neighbor? Because you see him reaping <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and words of good report? Then do you not bear in mind how much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> bring on the unguarded? Lifting them up to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, to vainglory, to arrogance, to contemptuousness; making them more careless? And besides these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, they wither also lightly away. For the most grievous thing is this, that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> arising therefrom abide <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, but the pleasure at the moment of its appearing, is flown away. For these things then do you <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>? Tell me.</p>

<p><q>But he has great influence with the Ruler, and leads and drives all things which way he will, and inflicts pain on them that offend him, and benefits his flatterers, and has much power.</q> These are the sayings of secular <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and of men that are riveted to the earth. For the spiritual man nothing shall be able to hurt.</p>

<p>For what serious harm shall he do to him? Vote him out of his office? And what of that? For if it be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> done, he is even profited; for nothing so provokes <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as for one to hold the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> office unworthily. But if <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, the blame again falls on the other, not on him; for he who has suffered anything <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, and borne it nobly, obtains in this way the greater confidence towards God.</p>

<p>Let us not then aim at this, how we may be in places of power, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and authority, but that we may live in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and self denial. For indeed places of authority persuade men to do many things which are  not approved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and great vigor of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is needed, in order to use authority aright. For as he that is deprived thereof, practises self restraint, whether with or against his will, so he that enjoys it is in some such condition, as if any one living with a graceful and beautiful damsel were to receive rules never to look upon her unchastely. For authority is that kind of thing. Wherefore many, even against their will, has it induced to show insolence; it awakens <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and removes the bridle from the tongue, and tears off the door of the lips; fanning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as with a wind, and sinking the bark in the lowest depth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Him then who is in so great danger do you admire, and do you say he is to be envied? Nay, how great <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is here! Consider, at any rate (besides what we have mentioned), how many enemies and accusers, and how many flatterers this person has besieging him. Are these then, I pray you, reasons for calling a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>? Nay, who can say so?</p>

<p><q>But the people,</q> you say, <q>hold high account of him.</q> And what is this? For the people surely is not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom he is to render account: so that in naming the people, you are speaking of nothing else than of other breakers, and rocks, and shoals, and sunken ridges. For to be in favor with the people, the more it makes a man illustrious, the greater the dangers, the cares, the despondencies it brings with it. For such an one has no power at all to take breath or stand still, having so severe a master. And why say I, <q>stand still and take breath</q>? Though such an one have never so many good works, hardly does he enter into the kingdom. For nothing is so wont to overthrow men, as the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which comes of the multitude, making them cowardly, ignoble, flatterers, hypocrites.</p>

<p>Why, for instance, did the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> say that Christ was possessed? Was it not because they were greedy of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the multitude?</p>

<p>And whence did the multitude pass the right judgment on Him? Was it not because this disease had no hold on them? For nothing, nothing so much tends to make men lawless and foolish, as gaping after the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of the multitude. Nothing makes them <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and immoveable, like despising the same.</p>

<p>Wherefore also great vigor of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is needed for him who is to hold out against such an impulse, and so violent a blast. For as when things are prosperous, he prefers himself to all, so when he undergoes the contrary, he would fain bury himself alive: and this is to him both <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and the kingdom, when he has come to be overwhelmed by this passion.</p>

<p>Is all this then, I pray you, matter of envyings, and not rather of lamentations and tears? Every one surely can see. But you do the same, in envying one in that kind of credit, as if a person, seeing another bound and scourged and torn by innumerable wild beasts, were to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> him his wounds and stripes. For in fact, as many men as the multitude comprises, so many bonds also, so many tyrants has he: and, what is yet more grievous, each of these has a different mind: and they all judge whatever comes into their heads concerning him that is a slave to them, without examining into anything; but whatever is the decision of this or that person, this they also confirm.</p>

<p>What manner of waves then, what tempest so grievous as this? Yea, such a one is both puffed up in a moment by the pleasure, and is under water again easily, being ever in fluctuation, in tranquillity never. Thus, before the time of the assembly, and of the contests in speaking, he is possessed with anxiety and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; but after the assembly he is either dead with despondency, or rejoices on the contrary without measure; a worse thing than sorrow. For that pleasure is not a less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than sorrow is plain from the effect it has on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; how light it makes it, and unsteady, and fluttering.</p>

<p>And this one may see even from those of former times. When, for instance, was David to be admired; when he rejoiced, or when he was in anguish? When, the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Groaning and calling upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or exulting in the wilderness, and worshipping the calf? Wherefore Solomon too, who best of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what pleasure is, says, <q>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of laughter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201712"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:2</a></span> Wherefore Christ also blesses the one, saying, <q>Blessed are they that mourn,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201713"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;5:4</a></span> but the other sort He bewails, saying, <q>Woe unto you that laugh, for you shall weep.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201714"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;6:25</a></span> And very fitly. For in delight the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is more relaxed and effeminate, but in mourning it is braced up, and grows sober, and is delivered from the whole swarm of <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, and becomes higher and stronger.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> then all these things, let us shun the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that comes from the multitude, and the pleasure that springs therefrom, that we may win the real and everlasting <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; unto which may we all attain, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might, forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
