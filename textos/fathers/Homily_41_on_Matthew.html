<h1>Homily 41 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Matthew 12:25-26.</strong></p>

<p><q>And Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself shall be brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself, shall not stand: and if <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> cast out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?</q></p>

<p>Even before now they had accused Him of this, that <q>by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> He casts out the devils.</q>  But whereas then He did not rebuke them, allowing them both to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His power by His more numerous <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and by His teaching to learn His majesty: now, since they continued saying the same, He proceeds also to rebuke them, showing His Godhead by this first, that He made their secrets public; and secondly, by the very act of casting out the devils with ease.</p>

<p>And indeed the accusation too was very shameless. Because, as I have said, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> seeks not what to say, but only that it may say somewhat. Yet for all that, not even so did Christ despise them, but defends Himself with the forbearance proper to Him, teaching us to be meek to our enemies; and though they say such things, as we are neither conscious of, nor have they any the least probability, not to be disturbed, nor troubled, but with all long suffering to render them an account. This then He did most especially on that very occasion, affording the strongest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, that the things were false that were said by them. For neither was it a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac's</a> part to exhibit so much meekness; it was not a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac's</a> part to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> men's secrets.</p>

<p>For, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, both because of the exceeding impudence of such a suspicion, and because of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the multitude, they dared not publicly make these charges, but were turning them in their mind. But He, to show them that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all that likewise, does not set down the accusation, nor does He expose their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; but the refutation He adds, leaving it to the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of them that had said it to convict them. For on one thing only was He bent, to do good to them that were sinning, not to expose them.</p>

<p>Yet surely, if He had been minded to extend his speech in length, and to make them ridiculous, and withal to have exacted of them also the most extreme penalty, there was nothing to hinder Him. Nevertheless He put aside all these things, and looked to one object only, not to render them more contentious, but more candid, and so to dispose them better toward amendment.</p>

<p>How then does He plead with them? Not by allegation out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> (for they would not so much as attend, but were sure rather to distort their meaning), but by the events of ordinary life. For <q>every kingdom,</q> says He, <q>divided against itself shall not stand; and a city and a house, if it be divided, is soon dissolved.</q> </p>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> from without are not so ruinous as the civil ones. Yea, and this is the case in bodies too; it is the case even in all things; but for this time He takes His illustration from those that are more publicly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</p>

<p>And yet, what is there more powerful on earth than a kingdom? Nothing, but nevertheless it perishes if in dissension. And if in that case one throw the blame on the great burden of the affairs thereof, as breaking down by its own weight; what would you say of a city? And what of a house? Thus, whether it be a small thing, or a great, if at dissension with itself, it perishes. If then I, having a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, do by him cast out the devils, there is dissension and fighting among devils, and they take their stand one against another. But if they stand one against another, their strength is wasted and destroyed. <q>For if <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> cast out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a></q> (and He said not <q>the devils,</q> implying their great unanimity one with another), <q>he is then divided against himself;</q> so He speaks. But if he be divided, he has become weaker, and is ruined; and if he be ruined, how can he cast out another?</p>

<p>Do you see how great the absurdity of the accusation, how great the folly, the inconsistency? Since it is not for the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to say first, that He stands, and casts out devils, and then to say, that He stands by  that, which it was likely would be the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of His undoing.</p>

<p>2. This then being the first refutation, the next after it is that which relates to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For not always in one way only, but also in a second and third, He solves their objections, being minded most abundantly to silence their shamelessness. Which sort of thing He did also with respect to the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, bringing forward David, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, the testimony that says, <q>I will have mercy, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, for which it was ordained; <q>for the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>,</q> says He, was for man.  This then He does in the present case also: where after the first He proceeds to a second refutation, plainer than the former. </p>

<p><q>For if I,</q> says He, <q>by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201718"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;12:27</a></span> </p>

<p>See here too His gentleness. For He said not, <q>my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</q> nor, <q>the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,</q> but <q>your sons;</q> to the end that if indeed they were minded to return to the same nobleness with them, they might derive hence a powerful spring that way; but if they were uncandid, and continued in the same course, they might not thenceforth be able to allege any plea, though ever so shameless. </p>

<p>But what He says is like this, <q>By whom do the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> cast them out?</q> For in fact they were doing so already, because they had received authority from Him, and these men brought no charge against them; their quarrel not being with the acts, but with the person only. As then it was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to show that their sayings arose only from their <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> against Him, He brings forward the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; thus: If I so cast them out, much more those, who have received their authority from me. Nevertheless, no such thing have ye said to them. How then bring ye these charges against me, the author of their doings, while acquitting them of the accusations? This, however, will not free you from your punishment, rather it will condemn you the more. Therefore also He added, <q>They shall be your judges.</q> For when <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> from among you, and having been practised in these things, both <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, it is most clear that they will also condemn those who are against me both in deed and word.</p>

<p><q>But if I cast out devils by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, then the Kingdom of God has come unto you.</q>  </p>

<p>What means <q>the Kingdom</q>? <q>My coming.</q> See how again He conciliates and soothes them, and draws them to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself, and signifies that they are warring with their own good, and contentious against their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <q>For whereas ye ought to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>,</q> says He, <q>and leap for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that One has come bestowing those great and unutterable blessings, hymned of old by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and that the time of your prosperity is at hand; ye do the contrary; so far from receiving the blessings, you do even speak ill of them, and frame accusations that have no real being.</q></p>

<p>Now Matthew indeed says, <q>If I by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> cast out</q>; but Luke, <q>If I by the finger of God cast out the devils:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201721"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;11:20</a></span> implying that to cast out devils is a work of the greatest power, and not of any ordinary <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And He means indeed that from these things they should infer and say, If this be so, then the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> has come. This, however, He says not, but in a reserved way, and so as not to be galling to them, He darkly intimates it by saying, <q>Then the kingdom of God has come unto you.</q> </p>

<p>Do you see exceeding wisdom? By the very things which they were blaming, He showed His presence shining forth.</p>

<p>Then, to conciliate them, He said not simply, <q>The Kingdom has come,</q> but, <q>unto you,</q> as though He had said, To you the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things have come; wherefore then feel displeased at your proper blessings? Why <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? This is that time, which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> long ago foretold: this, the sign of that advent which was celebrated by them, even these things being wrought by divine power. For the fact indeed, that they are wrought, yourselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; but that they are wrought by divine power, the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> themselves cry out. Yea, and it is impossible that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> should be stronger now; rather he must of absolute necessity be weak. But it cannot be, that he who is weak should, as though he were strong, cast out the strong <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. </p>

<p>Now thus speaking He signified the power of charity, and the weakness of separation and contentiousness. Wherefore He was Himself also continually charging His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, on every occasion, concerning charity, and teaching them that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, to subvert it, leaves nothing undone.</p>

<p>3. Having then uttered His second refutation, He adds also a third, thus saying:</p>

<p><q>How can one enter into the strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man, and then spoil his goods?</q>  </p> 

<p>For that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> cannot possibly cast out <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> is evident from what has been said; but that neither in any other way is it possible to cast him out, except one first get the better of him, this too is acknowledged by all.</p>

<p>What then is established hereby? The former statement, with more abundant evidence. <q>Why, I am so far,</q> says He, <q>from using the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> as an ally, that I make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon him, and bind him; and an infallible <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> thereof is the plundering of his goods.</q> See how the contrary is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, of what they were attempting to establish. For whereas they wished to show, that not by His own power does He cast out devils, He shows that not only the devils, but even their very chief leader is held by Him bound with all authority; and that over him, before them, did He prevail by His own power. And this is evident from the things that are done. For if he be the prince, and they subjects, how, except he were worsted, and made to bow down, could they have been spoiled?</p>

<p>And here His saying seems to me to be a <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> likewise. For not only, I suppose, are the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> the goods of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but also the men that are doing his works. Therefore to declare that He does not only cast out devils, but also will drive away all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from the world, and will put down his sorceries, and make all his arts useless, He said these things.</p>

<p>And He said not, He will take away, but <q>He will spoil,</q> to express what is done with authority. But He calls him <q>strong,</q> not because he is so by nature, God forbid, but declaring his former tyranny, which arose from our remissness.</p>

<p>4. <q>He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201724"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> </p>

<p>Behold also a fourth refutation. For what is my desire? Says He. To bring men to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to teach <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to proclaim the kingdom. What, that of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>? The contrary to these. How then should he that gathers not with me, nor is at all with me, be likely to co-operate with me? And why do I say co-operate? Nay, on the contrary, his desire is rather to scatter abroad my goods. He then who is so far from cooperating that he even scatters abroad, how should he have exhibited such unanimity with me, as with me to cast out the devils?</p>

<p>Now it is a natural surmise that He said this not of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> only, but Himself also of Himself, as being for His part against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and scattering abroad his goods. And how, one may say, is he that is not with me against me? By this very fact, of his not gathering. But if this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, much more he that is against him. For if he that does not co-operate is an enemy, much more he that wages <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</p>

<p>But all these things He says, to indicate His enmity against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, how great and unspeakable it is. For tell me, if you must go to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with any one, he that is not willing to fight on your side, by this very fact is he not against you? And if elsewhere He says, <q>He that is not against you is for you,</q> it is not contrary to this. For here He signified one actually against them, but there He points to one who in part is on their side: <q>For they cast out devils,</q> it is said <q>in Your name.</q>  </p>

<p>But to me He seems here to be hinting also at the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, setting them on the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> side. For they too were against Him, and were scattering what He gathered. As to the fact that He was hinting at them also, He declared it by speaking thus,</p>

<p><q>Therefore I say unto you, that all manner of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven unto men.</q>  </p>

<p>5. Thus having defended Himself, and refuted their objection, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the vanity of their shameless dealings, He proceeds to alarm them. For this too is no small part of advice and correction, not only to plead and persuade, but to threaten also; which He does in many passages, when making <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and giving counsel.</p>

<p>And though the saying seem to have much obscurity, yet if we attend, its solution will prove easy.</p>

<p>First then it were well to listen to the very words: <q>All manner of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> shall be forgiven unto men; but the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> shall not be forgiven unto them. And whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaks against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.</q>  </p>

<p>What now is it that He affirms? Many things have ye spoken against me; that I am a deceiver, an adversary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. These things I forgive you on your repentance, and exact no penalty of you; but <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Spirit shall not be forgiven, no,  not to those who repent. And how can this be right? For even this was forgiven upon repentance. Many at least of those who said these words <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> afterward, and all was forgiven them. What is it then that He says? That this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is above all things unpardonable. Why so? Because Himself indeed they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, who He might be, but of the Spirit they received ample experience. For the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also by the Spirit said whatever they said; and indeed all in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> had a very high notion of Him.</p>

<p>What He says, then, is this: Be it so: you are offended at me, because of the flesh with which I am encompassed: can you say of the Spirit also, We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not? And therefore is your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> unpardonable, and both here and hereafter shall you suffer punishment. For many indeed have been punished here only (as he who had committed fornication, as they who partook unworthily of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, among the Corinthians); but you, both here and hereafter. </p>

<p>Now as to your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> against me, before the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, I forgive them: and the daring crime too of the cross itself; neither shall you be condemned for your unbelief alone. (For neither had they, that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> before the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, perfect <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And on many occasions He even charges them to make Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to no man before the Passion; and on the cross He said that this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was forgiven them.) But as to your words touching the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, they will have no excuse. For in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He is speaking of what was said of Him before the crucifixion, He added, <q>Whosoever shall speak a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> there is no more forgiveness. Wherefore? Because this is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you; and the truths are notorious which you harden yourselves against. For though ye say that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not me; yet of this surely you are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, that to cast out devils, and to do cures, is a work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. It is not then I only whom you are insulting, but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> also. Wherefore your punishment can be averted by no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, neither here nor there.</p>

<p>For so of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, some are punished both here, and there, some here only, some there only, others neither here nor there. Here and there, as these very men (for both here did they pay a penalty, when they suffered those incurable ills at the taking of their city, and there shall they undergo a very grievous one), as the inhabitants of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>; as many others. There only, as the rich man who endured the flames, and had not at his command so much as a drop of water. Here, as he that had committed fornication among the Corinthians. Neither here nor there, as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, as the blessed Job; for their sufferings were not surely in the way of punishment, but as contests and wrestlings.</p>

<p>Let us labor, therefore, to be of the same part with these: or if not with these, at least with them that wash away their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> here. For fearful indeed is that other judgment, and inexorable the vengeance, and incurable the punishment.</p>

<p>6. But if you desire not to be punished even here, pass judgment on yourself, exact your own penalty. Listen to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when he says, <q>If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</q>  If you do this, proceeding in order you shall even arrive at a crown.</p>

<p>But how are we to exact our own penalty? One may ask. Lament, groan bitterly, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, afflict yourself, call to remembrance your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in their particulars. This thing is no small torture to a man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If any man has been in a state of contrition, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is punished by this more than anything. If any has been living in remembrance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the anguish thence arising. Therefore does God appoint righteousness as a reward for such repentance, saying, <q>Be first to tell your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that you may be justified.</q>  For it is not, it is not indeed, a small step towards amendment, to lay together all our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to be continually revolving and reckoning them up with their particulars. For he that is doing this will be so heart-broken, as not to think himself worthy so much as to live; and he that thinks thus, will be tenderer than any wax. For tell me not of acts of fornication only, nor of adulteries, nor of these things that are manifest, and acknowledged among all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: but lay together also your secret crafts, and your false accusations, and your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speakings, and your vain gloryings, and your <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and all such things. For neither will these bring a trifling punishment. For the reviler too shall fall into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; and the drunkard has no part in the kingdom; and he that lovest not his neighbor so offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as to find no help even in his own <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; and he that neglects his own has denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and he who overlooks the poor is sent into the fire.</p> 

<p>Account not then these things to be little, but put all together, and write them as in a book. For if you write them down, God blots them out; even as on the other hand, if you omit writing them, God both inscribes them, and exacts their penalty. It were then far better for them to be written by us, and blotted out above, than on the contrary, when we have forgotten them, for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to bring them before our eyes in that day.</p>

<p>Therefore that this may not be so, let us reckon up all with strictness, and we shall find ourselves answerable for much. For who is clear from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>? Nay, tell me not of the quantity, but since even in a small amount we shall pay the same penalty, consider this and repent. Who is rid of all insolence? Yet this casts into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Who has not secretly spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of his neighbor? Yet this deprives one of the Kingdom.  Who has not been self-willed? Yet this man is more unclean than all. Who has not looked with unchaste eyes? Yet this is a complete adulterer. Who has not been <q><a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a></q>? Yet such an one is <q>in danger of the council.</q> Who has not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>? Yet this thing is of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. Who has not forsworn himself? But this man is something more than of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. Who has not served <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>? But this man is fallen away from the genuine service of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>I have also other things greater than these to mention: but even these are enough, and able, if a man be not made of stone, nor utterly past feeling, to bring him to compunction. For if each one of them casts into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, what will they not bring to pass when all are met together?</p>

<p>How then can one be saved? It may be asked. By application of the countervailing remedies: <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, compunction, repentance, humility, a contrite heart, contempt of possessions. For God has marked out for us innumerable ways of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, if we be willing to attend. Let us then attend, and let us every way cleanse out our wounds, showing mercy, remitting our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against them that have displeased us, giving thanks for all things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> according to our power, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> sincerely, <q>making unto ourselves friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness.</q>  For so shall we be able to obtain pardon for our offenses, and to win the promised <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; whereof may we all be counted worthy, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
