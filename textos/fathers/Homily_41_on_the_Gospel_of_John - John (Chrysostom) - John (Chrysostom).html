<h1>Homily 41 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 5:39-40</h2>

<p> <q>Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; for in them ye think you have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; and they are they which testify of Me. And ye will not come to Me that you might have [<a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> ] life.</q></p>

<p>1. Beloved, let us make great account of spiritual things, and not think that it is sufficient for us to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to pursue them anyhow. For if in things of this life a man can gain no great profit if he conduct them in an indifferent and chance way, much more will this be the case in spiritual things, since these require yet greater attention. Wherefore Christ when He referred the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, sent them not to a mere reading, but a careful and considerate  search; for He said not, <q>Read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,</q> but, <q>Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>.</q> Since the sayings relating to Him required great attention, (for they had been concealed from the beginning for the advantage of the men of that time,) He bids them now dig down with care that they might be able to discover what lay in the depth below. These sayings were not on the surface, nor were they cast forth to open view, but lay like some treasure hidden very deep. Now he that searches for hidden things, except he seek them with care and toil, will never find the object of his search. For which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> He said, <q>Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, because in them ye think you have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> He said not, <q>You have,</q> but <q>ye think,</q> showing that they gained from them nothing great or high, expecting as they did to be saved by the mere reading, without the addition  of  <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. What He says therefore is of this kind: <q>Do ye not admire the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, do ye not think that they are the causes of all life? By these I confirm My claims now, for they are they which testify of Me, yet ye will not come to Me that you may have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> It was thus with good reason that He said, <q>ye think,</q> because they would not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, but merely prided themselves on the bare reading. Then lest owing to His very tender care He should incur among them the suspicion of vainglory, and because He desired to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by them, should be deemed to be seeking His own; (for He reminded them of the words of John, and of the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of His own works, and said all He could to draw them to Him, and promised them <q>life</q>; ) since, I say, it was likely that many would suspect that He spoke these things from a desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, hear what He says:</p>

<h2>John 5:41</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>I receive not honor from men.</q></div>
<p>That is, <q>I need it not</q>: <q>My nature,</q> He says, <q>is not of such a kind as to need the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which is from men, for if the sun can receive no addition from the light of a candle, much farther am I from needing the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which is from men.</q> <q>Why then,</q> asks some one, <q>do you say these things, if you need it not?</q> <q>That ye may be saved.</q> This He positively asserted above, and the same He implied here also, by saying, <q>that you might have life.</q> Moreover, He puts another reason:</p>

<h2>John 5:42</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>But I know you that you have not the love of God in you.</q></div>

<p>For when under pretense of loving God they  <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Him because He made Himself equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Him, lest any one should ask, <q>why do you speak these words?</q> <q>I speak them,</q> He says, <q>to convict you of this, that it is not for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God that you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Me, if it be so that He testifies to Me both by works and by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For as before this when you deemed Me an enemy of God ye drove Me away, so now, since I have declared these things, you ought to have hastened to Me, if you had really loved. God. But ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him not. And therefore have I spoken these words, to show that you are possessed with excessive <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, that you are vainly boasting and shading over  your own enviousness.</q> And the same He proves not by these things only, but by those that should come to pass.</p>

<h2>John 5:43</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>I have come in My Father's name, and you receive Me not; if another shall comei in his own name, him will you receive.</q></div>

<p>2. Do you see that He everywhere declares that He has been <q>sent,</q> that judgment has been committed to Him by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that He can do nothing of Himself, in order that He may cut off all excuse for their unfairness? But who is it that He here says shall come <q>in his own name</q>? He alludes here to <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, and puts  an incontrovertible <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their unfairness. <q>For if as loving God ye <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Me, much more ought this to have taken place  in the case of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. For he will neither say that he is sent by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor that he comes according to his will, but in everything contrariwise, seizing like a tyrant what belongs not to him, and asserting that he is the very God over all, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, 'Exalting himself above all that is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or that is worshipped, showing himself that he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse4">2 Thessalonians 2:4</a></span> This is to 'come in his own name.' I do not so, but have come in the Name of My Father.</q> That they received not One who said that He was sent of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was a sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they loved not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but now from the contrary of this fact, from their being about to receive <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, He shows their shamelessness.  For when they received not One who asserts that He was sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are about to worship one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him not, and who says that he is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> over all, it is clear that their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> proceeded from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and from hating God. On this account He puts two reasons for His words; and first the kinder one,  <q>That ye may be saved</q>; and, <q>That ye may have life</q>: and when they would have mocked at Him, He puts the other which was more striking, showing that even although His hearers should not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, yet that God was wont always to do His own works. Now <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaking concerning <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> said <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a>, that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall send them strong delusion&mdash;that they all might be judged who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2th002.htm#verse11">2 Thessalonians 2:11-12</a></span> Christ said not, <q>He shall come</q>; but, <q>if He come,</q> from tenderness for His hearers; and because all their obstinacy  was not yet complete. He was silent as to the reason of His coming; but <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, for those who can understand, has particularly alluded to it. For it is he who takes away all excuse from them.</p>

<p>Christ then puts also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their unbelief, saying . . .</p>

<h2>John 5:44</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?</q></div>

<p>Hence again He shows that they looked not to the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that under this pretense they desired to gratify private feeling, and were so far from doing this on account of  His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that they preferred <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from men to that which comes from Him. How then were they likely to entertain  such hostility towards Him  for a kind of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which they so despised, as to prefer to it the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which comes from men?</p>

<p>Having told them that they had not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> it by what was doing in His case, and by what should be in the case of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, and having demonstrated that they were deprived of all excuse, He next brings <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to be their accuser, going on to say,</p>

<h2>John 5:45-47</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust. For had ye believed Moses, you would have believed Me; for he wrote of Me. But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe My words?</q></div>

<p>What He says is of this kind: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>  who has been insulted more than I  by your conduct towards Me, for you have disbelieved him rather than Me.</q> See how in every way He has cast them out from all excuse. <q>You said that you loved God when you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Me; I have shown that you did so from <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of Him: ye say  that I break the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and annul the Law; I have rid Me of this <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> also: ye maintain  that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by what ye dare to do against Me; I on the contrary show that this is most to disbelieve in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; for so far am I from opposing the Law, that he who shall accuse you is none other than the man who gave you the Law.</q> As then He said of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, in which <q>ye think you have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life,</q> so of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also He says, <q>in whom you trust</q>; everywhere conquering them by their own weapons.</p>

<p><q>And whence,</q> says some one, <q>is it clear that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> will accuse us, and that you are not a boaster? What have you to do with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? You have broken the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> which he ordained that we should keep; how then should he accuse us? And how does it appear that we shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in another who comes in his own name? All these assertions you make without evidence.</q> Now in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> all these points are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> above. <q>For</q> (Christ would reply) <q>since it is acknowledged that I came from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both by the works, by the voice of John, and by the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, it is evident that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> will accuse the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> For what says he? <q>If a man come doing <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and leading you to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> foretelling things future, you must hearken unto him with all readiness.</q> Now Christ had done all this. He wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, He drew all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and (so that He ) caused accomplishment to follow His predictions. </p>

<p><q>But whence does it appear that they will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> another?</q> From their hating Christ, since they who turn aside from Him who comes according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will, it is quite plain, receive the enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And marvel not if He now puts forward <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, although He said, <q>I receive not <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> from man,</q> for He referrs them not to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. However, since the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> terrified them less, He brings round His discourse to the very person (of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>), setting over against them their Lawgiver as their accuser, thus rendering the terror more impressive;  and each of their assertions He refutes. Observe: they said that they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Him through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He shows that they did so through hating <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; they said that they held fast to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, He shows that they acted thus because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. For had they been <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the law, they ought to have received Him who fulfilled it; if they loved God they ought to have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> One who drew them to Him, if they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> they ought to have done homage to One of whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> prophesied. <q>But</q> (says Christ) <q>if <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is disbelieved before My coming, it is nothing unlikely that I, who am heralded by him, should be driven away by you.</q> As then He had shown from their conduct towards Himself that they who admired John (really) despised him, so now He shows that they who thought that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him not, and turns back on their own head all that they thought to put forward in their own behalf. <q>So far,</q> He says, <q>am I from drawing you away from the Law, that I call your Lawgiver himself to be your accuser.</q></p>

<p>That the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> testified of Him He declared, but where they testify He added not; desiring to inspire them with greater awe, and to prompt them to search, and to reduce them to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of questioning. For had He told them readily and without their questioning, they would have rejected the testimony; but now, if they gave any heed to His words, they needed first of all to ask, and learn from Him what that testimony was.  On this account He deals the more largely in assertions and threats, not in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> only, that even so He may bring them over by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of what He says; but they even so were silent. Such a thing is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; whatsoever a man say or do it is not stirred to move, but remains keeping its peculiar venom.</p>

<p> Wherefore we must cast out all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and never more contrive any deceit; for, says one, <q>To the perverse God sends crooked paths</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro021.htm#verse8">Proverbs 21:8</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span>; and, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirit of discipline  will flee deceit, and remove from thoughts that are without understanding.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom 1:5</a></span> For nothing makes men so foolish as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; since when a man is treacherous, unfair,  ungrateful, (these are different forms of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>,) when without having been wronged he grieves another, when he weaves deceits, how shall he not exhibit an example of excessive folly? Again, nothing makes men so wise as <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; it renders them thankful and fair-minded, merciful, mild, gentle, and candid; it is wont to be the mother of all other blessings. And what is more understanding than one so disposed? For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the very spring and root of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, just as all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> has its beginning in folly. For, the insolent man and the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> become the prey of their respective <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> from lack of wisdom; on which account the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said, <q>There is no soundness in my flesh: my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa038.htm#verse3">Psalm 38:3-4</a></span>: showing that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has its beginning in folly: and so the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> man who has the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God is more understanding than any; wherefore a wise man has said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse7">Proverbs 1:7</a></span> If then to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God is to have wisdom, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man has not that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he is deprived of that which is wisdom indeed&mdash;and deprived of that which is wisdom indeed, he is more foolish than any. And yet many admire the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> as being able to do <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and harm, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that they ought to deem them wretched above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who thinking to injure others thrust the sword against themselves&mdash;an act of extremest folly, that a man should strike himself and not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he does so, but should think that he is injuring another while he is killing himself. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that we slay ourselves when we smite others, says, <q>Why do ye not rather take wrong? Why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 6:7</a></span> For the not suffering wrong consists in doing none, as also the not being ill-used in not using others ill; though this assertion may seem a riddle to the many, and to those who will not learn <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> this, let us not call wretched or lament for those who suffer injury or insult, but for such who inflict these things; these are they who have been most injured, who have made God to be at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with them, and have opened the mouths of ten thousand accusers, who are getting an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> in the present life, and drawing down on themselves severe punishment in the life to come. While those who have been wronged by them, and have nobly borne it all, have God favorable to them, and all to condone with, and praise, and entertain them. Such as these in the present life, shall enjoy an exceeding good report, as affording the strongest example of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, and in the life to come shall share the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things everlasting; to which may we all attain through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
