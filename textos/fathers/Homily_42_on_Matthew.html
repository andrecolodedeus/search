<h1>Homily 42 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse33">Matt. XII. 33</a>.</strong></p>

<p><q>Either make the tree good, and his fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt; for the tree is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his fruit.</q></p>

<p>Again in another way He shames them, and is not content with His former refutations. But this He does, not freeing Himself from accusations, (for what went before was quite enough), but as wishing to amend them.</p>

<p>Now His meaning is like this: none of you has either found fault about the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> healed, as not being healed; nor has said, that it is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing to deliver one from a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For though they had been ever so shameless, they could not have said this.</p>

<p>Since therefore they brought no charge against the works, but were defaming the Doer of them, He signifies that this accusation is against both the common modes of reasoning, and the congruity of the circumstances. A thing of aggravated shamelessness, not only to interpret maliciously, but also to make up such charges as are contrary to men's common notions.</p>

<p>And see how free He is from contentiousness. For He said not, <q>Make the tree good, forasmuch as the fruit also is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>;</q> but, most entirely stopping their mouths, and exhibiting His own considerateness, and their insolence, He says, Even if you are  minded to find fault with my works, I forbid it not at all, only bring not inconsistent and contradictory charges. For thus were they sure to be most clearly detected, persisting against what was too palpable. Wherefore to no purpose is your maliciousness, says He, and your self-contradictory statements. Because in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the distinction of the tree is shown by the fruit, not the fruit by the tree; but you do the contrary. For what if the tree be the origin of the fruit; yet it is the fruit that makes the tree to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. And it were consistent, either in blaming us to find fault with our works too, or praising these, to set us who do them free from these charges. But now ye do the contrary; for having no fault to find with the works, which is the fruit, you pass the opposite judgment upon the tree, calling me a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a>; which is utter insanity.</p>

<p>Yea, and what He had said before, <span class="stiki" id="note201736"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;7:16-18</a></span> this He establishes now also; that a good tree cannot bring forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> fruit, nor again can the converse be. So that their charges were against all consistency and nature.</p>

<p>Then since He is arguing not for Himself, but for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, He has dealt out His reproof even as a torrent, saying, <q>O generation of vipers, how can you, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201737"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;12:34</a></span> </p>

<p>Now this is at once to accuse, and to give demonstration of His own sayings from their case. For behold, says He, you being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> trees, cannot bring forth good fruit. I do not then marvel at your talking thus: for you were both ill nurtured, being of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ancestors, and you have acquired a bad mind.</p>

<p>And see how carefully, and without any hold for exception, He has expressed His accusations: in that He said not, How can you speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, being a generation of vipers? (for this latter is nothing to the former): but, <q>How can you, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things?</q></p>

<p>But He called them <q>broods of vipers,</q> because they prided themselves on their forefathers. To signify therefore that they had no advantage thereby, He both casts them out from their relationship to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and assigns them forefathers of kindred disposition, having stripped them of that ground of illustriousness.</p>

<p><q>For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</q> Here again He indicates His Godhead, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> their secrets: and that not for words only, but also for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thoughts, they shall suffer punishment; and that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it all, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And He says, that it is possible even for men to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things; for this is a natural consequence, that when <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is overflowing within, its words should be poured forth through the lips. So that when you hear a man speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> words, do not suppose only so much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to be in him as the words display, but conjecture the fountain to be much more abundant; for that which is spoken outwardly, is the superabundance of that which is within.</p>

<p>See how vehemently He reprehends them. For if what they had said is so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and is of the very mind of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, consider the root and well-spring of their words, how far that must reach. And this is naturally the case; for while the tongue through shame often pours not forth all its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> at once, the heart having no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, fearlessly gives birth to whatever <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> it will; for of God it has not much regard.  Since then men's sayings come to examination and are set before all, but the heart is concealed; therefore the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the former grow less, while those of the latter increase. But when that within is multiplied, all that has been awhile hidden comes forth with a violent gushing. And as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> vomiting strive at first to keep down the humors that force their way out, but, when they are overcome, cast forth much abomination; so do they that devise <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, and speak ill of their neighbors.</p>

<p><q>A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man out of his good treasure,</q> says He, <q>brings forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> man out of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasure brings forth <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things.</q>  </p>

<p>For think not by any means, says He, that it is so in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> only, for in goodness also the same occurs: for there too the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> within is more than the words without. By which He signified, that both they were to be accounted more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than their words indicated, and Himself more perfectly good than His sayings declared. And He calls it <q>a treasure,</q> indicating its abundance.</p>

<p>Then again He fences them in with great terror. For think not at all, says He, that the thing stops at this, that is, at the condemnation of the multitude; nay, for all that do wickedly in such things shall suffer the utmost punishment. And He said not, <q>ye,</q> partly in order to instruct our whole race, partly to make His saying the less burdensome.</p>

<p><q>But I say unto you,</q> this is His word,  <q>that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201740"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;12:36</a></span> </p>

<p>And that is idle, which is not according to the fact, which is false, which has in it <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> accusation; and some say, that which is vain also, for instance, provoking inordinate laughter, or what is filthy, and immodest, and coarse.</p>

<p><q>For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201741"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;12:37</a></span> </p>

<p>Do you see how far the tribunal is from invidiousness? How favorable the account required? For not upon what another has said of you, but from what you have yourself spoken, will the Judge give His sentence; which is of all things the very fairest: since surely with you it rests, either to speak, or not to speak.</p>

<p>2. Wherefore not those that are <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a>, but the slanderers, have need to be anxious and to tremble. For the former are not constrained to answer for themselves touching the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things which are said of them, but the latter will, for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they have spoken; and over these impends the whole danger. So that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> censured should be without anxiety, not being to give account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that others have said; but the censurers have <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be in anxiety, and to tremble, as being themselves to be dragged before the judgment-seat in that behalf. For this is indeed a diabolical snare, and a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> having in it no pleasure, but harm only. Yea, and such an one is laying up an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasure in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And if he that has an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> humor in him does himself first reap the fruits of the malady, much more he that is treasuring up in himself what is more bitter than any bile, I mean, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, will suffer the utmost <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, gathering unto himself a grievous disease. And it is evident from the things that He vomits out. For if they pain others so much, far more the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that gives them birth.</p>

<p>Thus the plotter destroys himself first; just as he that treads on fire burns up himself, and he that smites adamant spites himself, and he that kicks against the pricks draws blood from himself. For somewhat of this kind is he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to suffer wrong, and to bear it manfully; he is adamant, and the pricks, and fire; but he that has used himself to do wrong is feebler than any clay.</p>

<p>Not therefore to suffer wrong is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but to do it, and not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to bear being wronged. For instance, how great wrongs did David endure! How great wrongs did Saul commit! Which then was the stronger and happier? Which the more wretched and miserable? Was it not he that did wrong? And mark it. Saul had promised, if David should slay the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>, to take him for his son-in law, and to give him his daughter with great favor. He slew the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a>; the other broke his engagements, and so far from bestowing her, did even go about to slay him. Which then became the more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>? Was not the one choking with despair and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, while the other shone brighter than the sun with his trophies, and his loyalty to God? Again, before the <a href="../cathen/03693b.htm">choir</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, was not the one suffocated with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, while the other enduring all in silence, won all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and bound them unto himself? And when he had even gotten him into his hands, and spared him, which again was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>? And which wretched? Which was the weaker? Which the more powerful? Was it not this man, who did not avenge himself even <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>? And very naturally. For the one had armed soldiers, but the other, righteousness, that is more mighty than ten thousand armies, for his ally and helper. And for this reason, though <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> conspired against, he endured not to slay him even <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>. For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> by what had taken place before, that not to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but to suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, this is what makes men more powerful. So it is with bodies also, so also with trees.</p>

<p>And what did Jacob? Was he not injured by Laban, and suffered <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Which then was the stronger? He that had gotten the other into his hands, and dared not touch him, but was afraid and trembling; <span class="stiki" id="note201744"><a href="../bible/gen031.htm#verse29">Genesis&nbsp;31:29</a></span> or he whom we see without arms and soldiers proving more terrible to him than innumerable kings?</p>

<p>But that I may give you another demonstration of what I have said, greater than this, let us again in the instance of David himself try the reasoning on the opposite side. For this man who being injured was so strong, afterwards upon committing an injury became on the contrary the weaker party. At least, when he had wronged Uriah, his position was changed again, and the weakness passed to the wrong doer, and the might to the injured; for he being dead laid waste the other's house. And the one being a king, and alive, could do nothing, but the other, being but a soldier, and slain, turned upside down all that pertained to his adversary.</p> 

<p>Would ye that in another way also I should make what I say plainer? Let us look into their case, who avenge themselves even <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>. For as to the wrong doers, that they are the most worthless of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, warring against their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; this is surely plain to every one.</p>

<p>But who avenged himself <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, yet kindled innumerable ills, and pierced himself through with many calamities and sorrows? The captain of David's host. For he both stirred up a grievous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and suffered unnumbered <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; not one whereof would have happened, had he but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> how to command himself.  </p>

<p>Let us flee therefore from this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and neither in words nor <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> do our neighbors wrong. For He said not, If you <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>, and summon a court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but simply, If you speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, though within yourself, even so shall you suffer the utmost punishment. Though it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which you have said, though thou have spoken upon conviction, even so shall vengeance come upon you. For not according to what the other has done, but according to what you have spoken, will God pass sentence; <q>for by your words you shall be condemned,</q> says He. Are you not told that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> also spoke the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and affirmed what was manifest to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, without discovering what was hidden? Nevertheless, he paid the utmost penalty.</p>

<p>But if we ought not to accuse men of things which are acknowledged, much less of those which are disputed; nay, for the offender has a judge. Do not now, I warn you, seize upon the privilege of the Only Begotten. For Him is the throne of judgment reserved.</p>

<p>3. Would you however be a judge? You have a court of judgment which has great profit, and bears no blame. Make consideration, as judge, to sit down upon your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and bring before it all your transgressions, search out the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and exact with strictness the account thereof, and say, <q>wherefore did you dare to do this and that?</q> And if she shun these, and be searching into other men's matters, say to her, <q>Not about these am I judging you, not for these are you come here to plead. For what, if such a one be a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man? Thou, why did you commit this and that offense? Answer for yourself, not to accuse; look to your own matters, do not those of others.</q> And be thou continually urging her to this anxious trial. Then, if she have nothing to say, but shrink back, wear her out with the scourge, like some restless and unchaste handmaid. And this tribunal do thou <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to sit every day, and picture the river of fire, the venomous worm, the rest of the torments.</p>

<p>And permit her not to be with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> any more, nor bear with her shameless sayings, <q>he comes to me, he plots against me, he tempts me;</q> but tell her, <q>If you were not willing, all that would be to no purpose.</q> And if she say again, <q>I am entangled with a body, I am clothed with flesh, I dwell in the world, I abide on earth;</q> tell her, <q>All these are excuses and pretexts. For such an one too was encompassed with flesh, and such another dwelling in the world, and abiding on earth, is approved; and you yourself too, when you do well, doest it encompassed with flesh.</q> And if she be pained at hearing this, take not off your hand; for she will not die, if you smite her, but you will save her from death. And if she say again, <q>Such an one provoked me,</q> tell her, <q>But it is in your power not to be provoked; often at least you have restrained your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> And if she say, <q>The beauty of such a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> moved me;</q> tell her, <q>Yet were you able to have mastered yourself.</q> Bring forward those that have got the better, bring forward the first <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who said, <q>The serpent beguiled me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201746"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse13">Genesis&nbsp;3:13</a></span> and yet was not acquitted of the blame.</p>

<p>And when you are searching out these things, let no man be present, let no man disturb you; but as the judges sit under curtains to judge, so do thou too, instead of curtains, seek a time and place of quiet. And when after your supper you are risen up, and art about to lie down, then hold this your judgment; this is the time convenient for you, and the place, your bed, and your chamber. This the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> likewise commanded, saying, <q>For the things which you say in your hearts, be ye moved to compunction upon your beds.</q>  And for small offenses require great satisfaction, that unto the great you may never even approach. If you do this every day, you will with confidence stand at that fearful judgment-seat.</p>

<p>In this way <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> became clean; therefore also he said, <q>For if we judged ourselves, we should not be judged.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note201748"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:31</a></span> Thus did Job cleanse his sons. <span class="stiki" id="note201749"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse5">Job&nbsp;1:5</a></span> For he that offered <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> for secret <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, much more did he require an account of such as were manifest.</p>

<p>4. But we do not so, but altogether the contrary. For as soon as we are laid down to rest, we rather think over all our worldly matters; and some introduce unclean thoughts, some usuries, and contracts, and temporal cares.</p> 

<p>And if we have a daughter, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, we watch her strictly; but that which is more precious to us than a daughter, our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, her we suffer to play the harlot and defile herself, introducing to her innumerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thoughts. And whether it be the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, or that of luxury, or that of fair <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or that of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, or be it what you will else that is minded to come in, we throw open the doors, and attract and invite it, and help it to defile our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at its leisure. And what can be more barbarous than this, to overlook our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is more precious than all, abused by so many adulterers, and so long companying with them, even until they are sated? Which will never be. So it is, therefore, that when sleep overtakes us, then only do they depart from her; or rather not even then, for our dreams and imaginations furnish her with the same images. Whence also, when day has come, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> stored with such images often falls away to the actual performance of those fancies.</p>

<p>And thou, while into the apple of your eye you suffer not so much as a grain of dust to enter, do you pass unnoticed your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, gathering to itself a heap of so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? When shall we then be able to clear out this filth, which we are daily laying up within us? When to cut up the thorns? When to sow the seed? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that henceforth the time of harvest is at hand? But we have not yet so much as ploughed our fields. If then the husbandman should come and find fault, what shall we say? And what answer shall we make? That no man gave us the seed? Nay, this is sown daily. That no man, then, has cut up the thorns? Nay, every day we are sharpening the sickle. But do the necessary engagements of life distract you? And why have you not crucified yourself to the world? For if he that repays that only, which is given him, is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, because he did not double it; he that has wasted even this, what will be said to him? If that person was bound, and cast out where is gnashing of teeth, what shall we have to suffer, who, when numberless motives are drawing us toward <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, shrink back and are unwilling?</p>

<p>For what is there, that has not enough in it to persuade you? Do you see not the vileness of the world, the uncertainty of life, the toil, the sweat, for things present? What? Is it the case that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must be toiled for, but may <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> be had without toil? If then both in the one and in the other there is toil, why did you not choose this, which has so great profit?</p>

<p>Or rather, there are some parts of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, which are free even from toil. For what kind of toil is it, not to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a>, not to lie, not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, to lay aside our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against our neighbor? Nay, on the contrary, to do these things is toilsome, and brings much anxiety.</p>

<p>What plea then shall we have, what excuse, not doing right even in these matters? For hereby it is plain, that out of remissness and sloth the more toilsome duties also altogether escape us.</p>

<p>All these things let us consider; let us flee <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, let us choose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that we may attain both unto the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that are present, and unto those that are to come, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
