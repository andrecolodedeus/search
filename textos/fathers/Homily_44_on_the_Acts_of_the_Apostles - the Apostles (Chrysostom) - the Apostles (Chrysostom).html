<h1>Homily 44 on the Acts of the Apostles</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse17">Acts XX. 17-21</a></p>

<p><q>And from Miletus he sent to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, and called the elders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And when they had come to him, he said unto them, You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, serving the Lord with all humility of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with many tears, and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, which befell me by the lying in wait of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> toward <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>See him, hasting to sail by, and yet not overlooking them, but taking order for all. Having sent for the rulers, through those he discourses to them (the Ephesians): but it is worthy of admiration, how finding himself under a necessity of saying certain great things about himself, he tries to make the least he can of it (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C1;&#x1F05;&#x03C4;&#x03B1; &#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x1F71;&#x03B6;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BD;</span>). <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> For just as Samuel, when about to deliver up the government to Saul says in their presence, <q>Have I taken anything of your hands? You are witnesses, and God also</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa012.htm#verse3">1 Samuel 12:3-5</a></span>; (so <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> here). David also, when disbelieved, says, <q>I was with the flock keeping my father's sheep: and when the bear came, I scared her away with my hands</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa017.htm#verse34">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a></span>: and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself too says to the Corinthians, <q>I have become a fool; you have compelled me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse11">2 Corinthians 12:11</a></span> Nay, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself also does the same, not speaking of himself upon any and every occasion, but only when He is disbelieved, then He brings up His benefits. Accordingly, see what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does here: first he adduces their own testimony: that you may not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> his words to be mere boasting, he calls the hearers themselves as witnesses of the things he says, since he was not likely to speak lies in their presence. This is the excellence of a teacher, to have for witnesses of his merits those who are his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And what is wonderful, Not for one day nor for two, says he, have I continued doing this. He wishes to cheer them for the future, that they may bravely bear all things, both the parting from him, and the trials about to take place&mdash; just as it was in the case of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Joshua. And see how he begins: <q>How I have been with you the whole time, serving the Lord with all humility of mind.</q> Observe, what most becomes rulers: <q>hating <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo018.htm#verse21">Exodus 18:21</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span>, says (<a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>): which (qualification) is especially in point for rulers, because to them there is (almost) a necessity of becoming arrogant. This (humility) is the groundwork of all that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, as in fact Christ says,  <q>Blessed are the poor in spirit.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew 5:3</a></span> And (here) not simply, <q>with humility of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> but, <q>with all humility.</q> For there are many kinds of humility, in word and in action, towards rulers, and toward the ruled. Will you that I mention to you some kinds of humility? There are some who are lowly towards those who are lowly, and high towards the high: this is not the character of humility.  Some then are such. Then, that he may not seem to be arrogant, he lays a foundation beforehand, removing that suspicion: For, <q>if, says he, I have acted 'with all humility of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,' it is not from arrogance that I say the things I say.</q> Then for his gentleness, ever with much condescension making them his fellows. <q>With you,</q> he says, <q>have I been, serving the Lord;</q> he makes the good works common to them with himself: none of it his own peculiar. <q>What?</q> (you will say) <q>why, against God could he possibly bear himself arrogantly?</q> And yet there are many who do bear themselves arrogantly against God: but this man not even against his own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. This is the merit of a teacher, by his own achievements of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to form the character of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Then for his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, upon which also he is very concise. <q>With many tears,</q> he says, <q>and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> which befell me by the lying in wait of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> Do you see that he grieves at their doings? But here too he seems to show how sympathizing he was: for he suffered for those who were going to perdition, for the doers themselves: what was done to himself, he even rejoiced at it; for he belonged to that band which <q>rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for that Name</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse41">Acts 5:41</a></span>: and again he says, <q>Now I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in my sufferings for you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse24">Colossians 1:24</a></span>: and again, <q>For our light affliction, which is but for the moment, works for us a far more exceeding and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> weight of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse17">2 Corinthians 4:17</a></span>. These things, however, he says, by way of making the least of his merits (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x1F71;&#x03B6;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;</span>). But there he show his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, not so much of daring, as of enduring: <q>I,</q> says he, <q>have been <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> entreated, but it was with you: and what is indeed the grievous part of the business, at the hands of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> Observe, he puts here both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. Mark, here, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, a character of teaching: <q>I kept back nothing,</q> he says, ungrudging fullness, unshrinking promptness&mdash; <q>of what was profitable unto you:</q> because there were things which they did not need to learn. For as the hiding some things would have been like grudging, so the saying all things would be folly. This is why he adds, <q>that was profitable unto you. But have showed you, and have taught you:</q> have not only said, but also taught: not doing this either as a mere matter of form. For that this is what he means, observe what he says: <q>publicly, and from house to house:</q> thereby representing the exceeding toil, the great earnestness and endurance. <q>Both <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and Greeks.</q> Not (addressing myself) to you alone. <q>Testifying:</q> here, the boldness of speech: and that, even though we do no good, yet we must speak: for  this is the meaning of <q>testifying,</q> when we speak to those who do not pay attention: and so the word <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span> is for the most part used. <q>I call heaven and earth to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy 4:26</a></span>, <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says: and now <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself, <span class="greek">&#x0394;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> <q>both to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks repentance toward God.</q> What do you testify? That they should be careful about their manner of life: that they should repent, and draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Both to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks</q>&mdash; for neither did the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him&mdash; both  by reason of their works, he says, <q>repentance towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and, by reason that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, he adds, <q>and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</q> To what end, then, do you say these things? To what end do you put them in mind of them? What has come of it? Have you anything to lay to their charge? Having first alarmed their feeling, then he adds, <q>And now, behold, I go bound in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> unto Jerusalem, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the things that shall befall me there: save that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and the ministry, which I have received of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, to testify the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse22">Acts 20:22-24</a></span>. Wherefore says he this? By way of preparing them to be always ready to meet dangers, whether seen or unseen, and in all things to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Spirit.  He shows that it is for great objects that he is led away from them. <q>Save that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> he says, <q>in every city witnesses to me saying</q>&mdash; to show that he departs willingly; that (see Hom. xlv. p. 273) you may not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> it any bond or necessity, when he says, <q>bound in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>&mdash; that in every city bonds and afflictions await me.</q> Then also he adds this, <q>I count not my life dear, until I shall have fulfilled my course and the ministry, which I received of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</q> Until I shall have finished my course, says he, with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Do you mark how (clearly) these were the words not of one lamenting, but of one who forbore to make the most (of his troubles) (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x1F71;&#x03B6;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>), of one who would instruct those (whom he addressed), and sympathize with them in the things which were befalling He says not, <q>I grieve indeed,  but one must needs bear it:</q> <q>but,</q> says he, <q>of none of those things do I make account, neither do I have,</q> i.e. account <q>my life dear to me.</q> Why this again? Not to extol himself, but to teach them, as by the former words, humility, so by these, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and boldness: <q>I have it not precious,</q> i.e. <q>I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it not before this: I account it more precious to finish my course, to testify.</q> And he says not, <q>to preach,</q> <q>to teach</q>&mdash; but what says he? <q>to testify (<span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x1F7B;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>)&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> He is about to say something more uncomfortable (<span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F7D;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>), namely, <q>I am pure from the blood of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> (because on my part) there is nothing lacking:</q> he is about to lay upon them the whole weight and burden: so he first mollifies their feelings by saying, <q>And now behold I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you shall see my face no more.</q> The consolation  is twofold: both that <q>my face you shall see no more,</q> for in heart I am with you: and that it was not they alone (who should see him no more): for, <q>you shall see my face no more, you all, among whom I have gone about preaching the Kingdom.</q>  So that he may well (say), "Wherefore I take you to record (read <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x1F78; &#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;</span> . for <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03C4;</span>.)&mdash;seeing I shall be with you no more&mdash; <q>that I am pure from the blood of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse26">Acts 20:26</a></span> Do you mark how he terrifies them, and troubled and afflicted as their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are, how hard he rubs them (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span>)? But it was necessary. <q>For I have not shunned,</q> he says, <q>to declare unto you all the counsel of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse27">Acts 20:27</a></span> Why then, he who does not speak, has blood to answer for: that is, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>! Nothing could be more terrifying than this. He shows that they also, if they <em>do</em> it not, have blood to answer for. So, whereas he seems to be justifying himself, in fact he is terrifying them. <q>Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has made you overseers (or, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>) to feed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> (see note 3), which He has purchased with His own blood.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse28">Acts 20:28</a></span> Do you mark? He enjoins them two things. Neither success in bringing others right of itself is any gain&mdash; for, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he says, <q>lest by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a cast-away</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1 Corinthians 9:27</a></span>; nor the being diligent for one's self alone. For such an one is selfish, and seeks his own good only, and is like to him who buried his talent. <q>Take heed to yourselves:</q> this he says, not because our own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is more precious than that of the flock, but because, when we take heed to ourselves, then the flock also is a gainer. <q>In which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has made you overseers, to feed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>.</q> See, it is from the Spirit you have your ordination. This is one constraint: then he says, <q>To feed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord.</q>  Lo! Another obligation: the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the Lord's.  And a third: <q>which He has purchased with His own blood.</q> It shows  how precious the concern is; that the peril is about no small matters, seeing that even His own blood He spared not. He indeed, that he might reconcile those who were enemies, poured out even His blood: but thou, even when they have become your friends, are not able to retain them. <q>For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse29">Acts 20:29</a></span> Again he engages (<span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x1F73;&#x03C6;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span>) them from another quarter, from the things which should come after: as when he says, <q>We wrestle not against flesh and blood. After my departing,</q> he says, <q>grievous wolves shall enter in among you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians 6:12</a></span>; twofold the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, both that he himself would not be present, and that others would assail them. <q>Then why depart, if you know this beforehand?</q> The Spirit draws me, he says. Both <q>wolves,</q> and <q>grievous, not sparing the flock;</q> and what is worse, even <q>from among your own selves:</q> the grievous thing (this), when the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is moreover an intestine <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The matter is exceeding serious, for it is <q>the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord:</q> great the peril for with blood He redeemed it: mighty the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and twofold. <q>Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse30">Acts 20:30</a></span> <q>How then? What comfort shall there be?</q> <q>Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse31">Acts 20:31</a></span> See how many strong expressions are here: <q>with tears,</q> and <q>night and day,</q> and <q>every one.</q> For it was not that if he saw many,  then he came in (to the work), but even were it for a single <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he was capable of doing everything (for that one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>). So it was, in fact, that he compacted them together (<span class="greek">&#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03BA;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C4;&#x03B7;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;</span>) (so firmly as he did). <q>Enough done on my part: three years have I remained:</q> they had establishing enough, he says; enough of roofing. <q>With tears,</q> he says. Do you see that the tears were on this account? The bad man grieves not: grieve thou: perhaps he will grieve also. As, when the sick man sees his physician partaking of food, he also is incited to do the same: so likewise here, when he sees you weeping, he is softened: he will be a good and great man. </p>

<p>(Recapitulation.) <q>Not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>,</q> he says, <q>the things that shall befall me.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 22, 23.) Then is this why you depart? By no means; on the contrary (I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that), <q>bonds and afflictions await me.</q> That (there are) trials, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, but of what kind I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not: which was more grievous. <q>But none of these things move me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse24">Acts 20:24</a></span>: for do not suppose that I say these things as lamenting them: for <q>I hold not my own life dear.</q> It is to raise up their minds that he says all this, and to persuade them not only not to flee, but also to bear nobly. Therefore it is that he calls it a <q>course</q> and a <q>ministry,</q> on the one hand, showing it to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> from its being a race, on the other, showing what was due from it, as being a ministry. I am a minister: nothing more. Having comforted them, that they might not grieve that he was so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> entreated, and having told them that he endured those things <q>with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>,</q> and having shown the fruits of them, then (and not before) he brings in that which would give them pain, that he may not overwhelm their minds. <q>And  now behold,</q> etc. <q>Wherefore I take you to record, that I am pure from the blood of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because I have not shrunk from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse25">Acts 20:25-27</a></span>: * * * that (counsel) which concerns the present matter. <q>For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse29">Acts 20:29</a></span> <q>What then,</q> someone might say, <q>thinkest you yourself so great? If you should depart, are we to die?</q> I say not this, he replies, that my absence causes this: but what? That there should rise up against you certain of another sort: he says not, <q>because of my departing,</q> but <q>after my departing:</q> that is, after his going on his journey.&mdash; And yet this thing has happened already: much more (then will it happen) hereafter. Then we have the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, <q>to draw away <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> after them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse30">Acts 20:30</a></span>. That there are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, this is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and no other than this. Then comes also consolation. But if He <q>purchased</q> it <q>with His own blood,</q> He will assuredly stand forward in its defence. <q>Night and day,</q> he says, <q>I cease not to warn with tears.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse31">Acts 20:31</a></span> This might well be said in our case also: and though the speech seems to refer peculiarly to the teachers, it is common also to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For what, though I speak and exhort and weep night and day, while the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> obeys not? Therefore  it is that he says, <q>I take you to record:</q> since also himself says, <q>I am pure from the blood of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: for I have not shunned to declare unto you.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 26, 27.) Why then, this only is to be a teacher, to declare, to preach, to instruct, shrink from nothing, to exhort night and day: but if, while one is doing all this, nothing comes of it, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what remains. Then you have another justification: <q>I am pure from the blood of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> Think not that these words are spoken to us only: for indeed this speech is addressed to you also, that you should attend to the things spoken, that you should not start away from the hearing. What can I do? Lo! each day I rend myself with crying out, <q>Depart from the theatres:</q> and many laugh at us: <q>Desist from swearing, from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>:</q> numberless are our exhortations, and there is none to hear us. But I do not discourse during night? Fain would I do this also in the night time, and at your tables, if it were possible that one could be divided into ten thousand pieces, so as to be present with you and discourse. But if once in the week we call to you, and you shrink back, and some of you do not even come here, and you that do come, depart having received no profit&mdash;what shall we do? Many I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even sneer at us, that we are forever discoursing about the same things: so wearisome are we become to you by very satiety. But for this not we are to blame, but the hearers may thank themselves. For he indeed who is making good progress, rejoices to hear the same things always; it seems to be his praises that he hears spoken: but he who does not wish to get on, seems even to be annoyed, and though he hear the same thing but twice, it seems to him that he is hearing it often.</p>

<p><q>I am pure,</q> he says, <q>from the blood of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse26">Acts 20:26</a></span> This was fit and proper for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to say, but we dare not say it, conscious as we are of numberless faults. Wherefore for him the ever vigilant, ever at hand, the man enduring all things for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, it was fit and proper to say this: but we must say that of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>The Lord was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me for your sakes</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu003.htm#verse26">Deuteronomy 3:26</a></span>, because ye lead us also into many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For when we are dispirited at seeing you make no progress, is not the greater part of our strength struck down? For what, I ask you has been done? Lo! By the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God we also have now passed the space of three years,  not indeed night and day exhorting you, but doing this, often every third day, or every seventh. What more has come of it? We accuse, we rebuke, we weep, we are in anguish, although not openly, yet in heart. But those (inward) tears are far more bitter than these (outward ones): for these indeed bring a kind of relief to the feelings of the sorrowful, whereas those aggravate it, and bind it fast. Since when there is any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of grief, and one cannot give vent to the sorrow, lest he should seem to be vainglorious, think what he suffers! Were it not that people would tax me with excessive <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of display, you would see me each day shedding fountains of tears: but to those my chamber is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and my hours of solitude. For <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me I have (at times) despaired of my own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but from my mourning on your account, I have not even leisure to bemoan my own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: so entirely are you all in all to me. And whether I perceive you to be advancing, then, for very delight, I am not sensible of my own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: or whether I see you not advancing, such is my grief, I again dismiss my own cares from my thoughts: brightening up on account of your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, though I myself have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> without number, and saddened on account of your painful things, though my own successes are without number. For what hope is there for the teacher, when his flock is destroyed? What kind of life, what kind of expectation is there for him? With what sort of confidence will he stand up before God? What will he say? For grant that he has nothing laid to his charge, has no punishment to suffer, but is <q>pure from the blood of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>:</q> yet even so will he suffer a grief incurable: since fathers also though they be not liable to be called to account for their children's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nevertheless have grief and vexation. And this profits them nothing,  nor shields them (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>). <q>For it is they that watch for our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as those that must give account.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse17">Hebrews 13:17</a></span> This seems to be a fearful thing: to me this gives no concern after your destruction. For whether I give account, or not, it is no profit to me. Might it be, that you were saved, and I to give account because of you: ye saved, and I charged with not having fulfiled my part! For my anxiety is not that you should be saved through me as the means, but only that you should be saved, no matter by what person as the instrument. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the pangs of spiritual childbirth, how overpowering they are; how he who is in travail with this birth, would rather be cut into ten thousand pieces, than see one of those to whom he has given birth perishing and undone. Whence shall we persuade you? By no other argument indeed, but by what has been done, in all that regards you we shall clear ourselves.  We too shall be able to say, that in nothing have we <q>shrunk from declaring</q> to you the whole <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: nevertheless we grieve: and that we do grieve, is manifest from the numberless plans we lay and contrivances we devise. And yet we might say to ourselves, What matters it to me? I have done my part, <q>I am pure from</q> (their) <q>blood:</q> but this is not enough for comfort. If we could tear open our heart, and show it to you, you would see with what largeness it holds (you) within it, both <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children and men; for such is the power of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that it makes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more spacious than the heaven. <q>Receive us,</q> says (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>): <q>we have wronged no man, you are not straitened in us.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; 6:12</span> He had all <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a> in his heart, and says, <q>You are not straitened: be ye also enlarged</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 6:13</a></span>; but I myself could not say this, for I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that you both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me and receive me. But what is the profit either from my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or from yours, when the things pertaining to God thrive not in us? It is a ground for greater sorrow, an occasion of worse mischief (<span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F7B;&#x03BC;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;</span>, al. <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x1F7B;&#x03C0;&#x03B7;&#x03C2;</span>). I have nothing to lay to your charge: <q>for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse15">Galatians 4:15</a></span> <q>We yearn not only to give you the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, but also our own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse8">1 Thessalonians 2:8</a></span> We are loved and we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> (you): but this is not the question. But let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>for the first commandment is, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God: and the second is like it, And your neighbor as yourself.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew 22:37-39</a></span> We have the second, we need the first: need the first, exceedingly, both I and you. We have it, but not as we ought. Let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him: ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how great a reward is laid up for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ: let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him with fervor of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that, enjoying his goodwill, we may escape the stormy waves of this present life, and be found worthy to obtain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things promised to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of His only-begotten Son, with whom to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, might, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
