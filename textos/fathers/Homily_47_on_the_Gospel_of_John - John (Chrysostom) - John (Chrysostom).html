<h1>Homily 47 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 6:53-54</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Jesus therefore said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you have not eternal  life in yourselves. Whoso eats My flesh, and drinks My blood, has life  in himself.</q></div>

<p>1. When we converse of spiritual things, let there be nothing secular in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, nothing earthy, let all such thoughts retire, and be banished, and let us  be entirely given up to the hearing the divine oracles only. For if at the arrival of a king  all confusion is driven away, much more when the Spirit speaks with us do we need  great stillness, great awe. And worthy of awe is that which is said today. How it is so, hear. <q>Verily I say unto you, Except a man eat My flesh, and drink My blood, he has not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life in him.</q> Since the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had before asserted that this was impossible, He shows not only that it is not impossible, but that it is absolutely necessary. Wherefore He adds, <q>He that eats My flesh and drinks My blood, has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q></p>

<p><q>And I will raise him up at the last day.</q> For since He had said, <q>He that eats of this bread shall not die for ever</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse50">John 6:50</a>, not verbally quoted</span>, and it was likely that this would stand in their way, (just as they before said, <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is dead, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are dead; and how sayest Thou, that he shall not taste of death?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse52">John 8:52</a>, not verbally quoted</span>) He brings forward the Resurrection to solve the question, and to show that (the man who eats) shall not die at the last.  He continually handles the subject of the Mysteries, showing the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the action, and that it must by all means be done.</p>

<h2>John 6:55</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>For My flesh is true  meat, and My blood is true drink.</q></div>

<p>What is that He says?  He either desires to declare that this is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meat which saves the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, or to assure them concerning what had been said, that they might not suppose the words to be a mere enigma or <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, but might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is by all means needful to eat the Body. Then He says,</p>

<h2>John 6:56</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>He that eats My flesh, dwells in Me.</q></div>

<p>This He said, showing that such an one is blended with  Him. Now what follows seems unconnected, unless we enquire into the sense; for, says some one, after saying, <q>He that eats My flesh, dwells in Me,</q> what kind of a consequence is it to add,</p>

<h2>John 6:57</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>As the living Father has sent Me, and I live by the Father.</q></div>

<p>Yet the words harmonize perfectly. For since He continually spoke of <q><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life,</q> to prove this point He introduces the expression, <q>dwells in Me</q>; for <q>if he dwells in Me, and I live, it is plain that he will live also.</q> Then He says, <q>As the living Father has sent Me.</q> This is an expression of comparison and resemblance, and its meaning is of this kind, <q>I live in like manner as the Father lives.</q> And that you may not deem Him unbegotten, He immediately subjoins, <q>by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> not by this to show that He needs, in order to live, any power working in Him,  for He said before, to remove such a suspicion, <q>As the Father has life in Himself, so has He given to the Son also to have life in Himself</q>; now if He needs the working of another, it will be found that either the Father has not given Him so to have it, and so the assertion is false, or if He has so given it, then He will need no other one to support Him. What then means the, <q>By the Father</q>? He here merely hints at the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and what He says is of this kind: <q>As the Father lives, so I live, and he that eats Me shall live by Me.</q> And the <q>life</q> of which He speaks is not life merely, but the excellent  life; for that He spoke not simply of life, but of that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and ineffable life, is clear from this. For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <q>live,</q> even unbelievers, and uninitiated, who eat not of that flesh. Do you see that the words relate not to this life, but to that other? And what He says is of this kind: <q>He that eats My flesh, when he dies shall not perish nor suffer punishment</q>; He spoke not of the general resurrection, (for all alike rise again,) but concerning the special, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Resurrection, that which has a reward.</p>

<h2>John 6:58</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>This is that bread which came down from heaven; not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead; he that eats of this bread shall live for ever.</q></div>

<p>Continually does He handle the same point, so as to imprint it on the understanding of the hearers, (for the teaching on these points was a  kind of final teaching,) and to confirm the doctrine of the Resurrection and of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Wherefore He mentions the Resurrection since He promises <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, showing that that life is not now, but after the Resurrection.  <q>And whence,</q> says some one, <q>are these things clear?</q> From the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; to them He everywhere referrs the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, bidding them learn these things from them. And by saying, <q>Which gives life to the world,</q> He incites them to jealousy, that from very vexation that others should enjoy the gift, they may not stay without. And continually He reminds them of the manna, showing the difference, (between it and His bread,) and guiding them to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for if He was able  to support their life for forty years without harvest, or grain, or other things in course;  much more now will He be able to do so, as having come for greater ends. Moreover, if those things were but types, and yet men collected what came down without sweat or labor; much more shall this be the case, where the difference is great both in the never dying, and in the enjoying the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life. And rightly has He spoken often of <q>life,</q> since this is desired by men, and nothing is so pleasing to them as not to die. Since even under the old Covenant, this was the promise, length of life and many days, but now it is not length merely, but life having no end. He desires at the same time to show, that He now revokes the punishment caused by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, annulling that sentence which condemns to death, and bringing in not life merely, but life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, contrariwise to the former things. </p>

<h2>John 6:59</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>These things said He in the synagogue, as He taught in Capernaum.</q></div>

<p>2. The place where most of His marvels had been done, so that He ought there especially to have been listened to. But wherefore taught He in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> and in the Temple? As well because He desired to catch the greatest number of them, as because He desired to show that He was not opposed to the Father.</p>

<h2>John 6:60</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>But many of the disciples, when they had heard this, said, This is a hard saying.</q></div>

<p>What means <q>hard</q>? Rough, laborious, troublesome. Yet He said nothing of this kind, for He spoke not of a mode of life,  but of doctrines, continually handling the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in Him. What then means, <q>is a hard saying</q>? Is it because it promises life and resurrection? Is it because He said that He came down from heaven? Or that it was impossible for one to be saved who ate not His flesh? Tell me, are these things <q>hard</q>? Who can assert that they are? What then means <q>hard</q>? It means, <q>difficult to be received,</q> <q>transcending their infirmity,</q> <q>having much terror.</q> For they thought that He uttered words too high for His real character, and such as were above Himself. Therefore they said,</p>

<p><q>Who can hear it?</q></p>

<p>Perhaps making excuse for themselves, since they were about to start away.</p>

<h2>John 6:61-62</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>When Jesus knew in Himself that His disciples murmured at it,</q> (for this is an attribute of His Godhead to bring secret things to light,) <q>He said unto them, Does this offend you? What and if you shall see  the Son of Man ascend up where He was before?</q></div>

<p>This also He does in the case of Nathanael, saying, <q>Because I said unto you, I saw you under the fig-tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse50">John 1:50</a></span> And to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, <q>No man has ascended up to heaven but the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> which is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse13">John 3:13</a></span> What then, does He add difficulties to difficulties? No, (that be far from Him,) but by the greatness of the doctrines, and the number of them, He desires to bring them over. For if one had said simply, <q>I have come down from heaven,</q> and added nothing more, he would have been the more likely to offend them; but He who said, <q>My body is the life of the world</q>; He who said, <q>As the living Father has sent Me, so I live by the Father</q>; and who said, <q>I have come down from heaven,</q> solves the difficulty. For the man who utters any one great thing concerning himself may perhaps be suspected of feigning, but he who connects together so many one after another removes all suspicion. All that He does and says is intended to lead them away from the thought, that Joseph was His father. And it was not with a wish to strengthen, but rather to do away that stumbling-block, that He said this. For whosoever deemed that He was Joseph's son could not receive His sayings, while one that was persuaded that He had come down from heaven, and would ascend there, might more easily give heed to His words: at the same time He brings forward also another explanation, saying,</p>

<h2>John 6:63</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>It is the Spirit that quickens, the flesh profits nothing.</q></div>

<p>His meaning is, <q>You must hear spiritually what relates to Me, for he who hears carnally is not profited, nor gathers any advantage.</q> It was carnal to question how He came down from heaven, to deem that He was the son of Joseph, to ask, <q>How can he give us His flesh to eat?</q> All this was carnal, when they ought to have understood the matter in a mystical and  spiritual sense. <q>But,</q> says some one, <q>how could they understand what the 'eating flesh' might mean?</q> Then it was their duty to wait for the proper time and enquire, and not to abandon Him.</p>

<p><q>The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life.</q></p>

<p>That is, they are divine and spiritual, have nothing carnal about them, are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of physical consequence, but are free from any such necessity, are even set above the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> appointed for this world, and have also another and a different meaning. Now as in this passage He said <q>spirit,</q> instead of <q>spiritual,</q> so when He speaks of <q>flesh,</q> He meant not <q>carnal things,</q> but <q>carnally hearing,</q> and alluding at the same time to them, because they ever desired carnal things when they ought to have desired spiritual. For if a man receives them carnally, he profits nothing. <q>What then, is not His flesh, flesh?</q> Most certainly. <q>How then says He, that the flesh profits nothing?</q> He speaks not of His own flesh, (God forbid!) but of those who received His words in a carnal manner. But what is <q>understanding carnally</q>? It is looking merely to what is before our eyes, without imagining anything beyond. This is understanding carnally. But we must not judge thus by sight, but must look into all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> with the eyes within. This is seeing spiritually. He that eats not His flesh, and drinks not His blood, has no life in him. How then does <q>the flesh profit nothing,</q> if without it we cannot live? Do you see that the words, <q>the flesh profits nothing,</q> are spoken not of His own flesh, but of carnal hearing?</p>

<h2>John 6:64</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>But there are some of you that believe not.</q></div>

<p>Again, according to His custom, He adds weight to His words, by foretelling what would come to pass, and by showing that He spoke thus not from desire of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from them, but because He cared for them. And when He said <q>some,</q> He excepted the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For at first He said, <q>You have both seen Me, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse36">John 6:36</a></span>; but here, <q>There are some of you that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</q></p>

<p>For He <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> from the beginning who they were that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, and who should betray Him.</q></p>

<h2>John 6:65</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And He said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto Me except it were given unto Him from above from My Father.</q></div>

<p>3. Here the Evangelist intimates to us the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> character of the Dispensation, and His endurance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Nor is the, <q>from the beginning,</q> put here without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but that you may be aware of His foreknowledge from the first, and that before the words were uttered, and not after the men had murmured nor after they had been offended, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the traitor, but before, which was an attribute of Godhead. Then He added, <q>Except it be given him from above from My Father</q>; thus persuading them to deem God His Father, not Joseph, and showing them that it is no common thing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him. As though He had said, <q>Unbelievers disturb Me not; trouble Me not, astonish Me not. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of old before they were created, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to whom the Father has given to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>;</q> and do thou, when you hear that <q>He has given,</q> <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> not merely an arbitrary distribution,  but that if any has rendered himself worthy to receive the gift, he has received it.</p>

<h2>John 6:66</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>From that time many of His disciples went back, and walked no more with Him.</q></div>

<p>Rightly has the Evangelist said, not that they <q>departed,</q> but that they <q>went back</q>; showing that they cut themselves off from any increase in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and that by separating themselves they lost the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they had of old. But this was not the case with the twelve; wherefore He says to them,</p>

<h2>John 6:67</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Will ye also go away?</q></div>

<p>Again showing that He needs not their ministry and service, and proving to them that it was not for this that He led them about with Him. For how could He when He used such expressions even to them? But why did He not praise them? Why did He not approve them? Both because He preserved the dignity befitting a teacher, and also to show them that they ought rather to be attracted by this mode of dealing. For had He praised them, they might, supposing that they were doing Him a favor, have had some <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feeling; but by showing them that He needed not their attendance, He kept them to Him the more. And observe with what <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> He spoke. He said not, <q>Depart ye,</q> (this would have been to thrust them from Him,) but asked them a question, <q>Will ye also go away?</q> the expression of one who would remove all force or compulsion, and who wished not that they should be attached to Him through any sense of shame, but with a sense of favor. By not openly accusing, but gently glancing at them, He shows what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> wise course under such circumstances. But we feel differently; with good reason, since we do everything holding fast our own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and therefore think that our estate is lowered by the departure of those who attend on us. But He neither flattered nor repulsed them, but asked them a question. Now this was  not the act of one despising them, but of one wishing them not to be restrained by force and compulsion: for to remain on such terms is the same as to depart. What then says Peter?</p>

<h2>John 6:68-69</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>To whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. And we believe and are sure that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.</q></div>

<p>Do you see that it was not the words that caused offense, but the heedlessness, and sloth, and wrong-mindedness of the hearers? For even had He not spoken, they would have been offended, and would not have ceased to be ever anxious about bodily food, ever nailed to earth. Besides, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> heard at the same time with the others, yet they declared an opinion contrary to theirs, saying, <q>To whom shall we go?</q> An expression indicating much affection, for it shows that their Teacher  was more precious to them than anything, than father or mother, or any possessions,  and that if they withdrew from Him, they had not then whither to flee. Then lest it should seem that he had said, <q>to whom shall we go?</q> because there were none that would receive them, he straightway added, <q>You have the words of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> listened carnally, and with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> reasonings, but the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> spiritually, and committing all to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore Christ said, <q>The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit</q>; that is, <q>do not suppose that the teaching of My words is subject to the rule of material consequences, or to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things. Things spiritual are not of this nature, nor endure to submit to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of earth.</q> This also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares, saying, <q>Say not in your heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down;) or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse6">Romans 10:6-7</a></span></p>

<p><q>You have the words of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> These men already admitted the Resurrection, and all the apportionment  which shall be there. And observe the brotherly and affectionate man, how he makes answer for all the band. For he said not, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> but, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> Or rather, observe how he goes to the very words of his Teacher, not speaking as did the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. They said, <q>This is the son of Joseph</q>; but he said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God</q>; and <q>You have the words of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</q>; having perhaps heard Him say,  <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me  has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</q> For he showed that he retained all that had been said, by recalling the very words. What then did Christ? He neither praised nor expressed admiration of Peter, though He had elsewhere done so; but what says He?</p>

<h2>John 6:70</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?</q></div>

<p>For since Peter said, <q>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> Jesus excepts Judas from the band. In the other place Peter made no mention of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; but when Christ said, <q>Whom say ye that I am?</q> he replied, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the Son of the living God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse15">Matthew 16:15</a></span>; but here, since he said, <q>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> Christ with reason admits not Judas into that band. And this He did afar off, and long before the time, to check the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the traitor, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He should avail nothing, yet doing His own part.</p>

<p>4. And remark His wisdom. He made not the traitor manifest, yet allowed him not to be hidden; that on the one hand he might not lose all shame, and become more contentious; and on the other, that he might not, thinking to be unperceived, work his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> deed without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Therefore by degrees He brings plainer reproofs against him. First, He numbered him too among the others, when He said, <q>There are some of you that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not,</q> (for that He counted the traitor the Evangelist has declared, saying, <q>For He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> from the beginning who they were that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, and who should betray Him;</q>) but when he yet remained such, He brought against him a more severe rebuke, <q>One of you is a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> yet made the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> common to them all, wishing to conceal him. And here it is worth while to enquire, why the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> at this time said nothing, but afterwards were afraid and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, looking one upon another, and asking, <q>Lord, is it I?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse22">Matthew 26:22</a></span>, when Peter beckoned to John to find out the traitor, by enquiring of their Teacher which was he. What is  the reason? Peter had not yet heard, <q>Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> wherefore he had no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> at all; but when he had been rebuked, and though he spoke through strong affection,  instead of being approved of, had even been called <q><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> he afterwards with reason feared when he heard, <q>One of you shall betray Me.</q> Besides, He says not even now, <q>One of you shall betray Me,</q> but, <q>One of you is a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></q>; wherefore they understood not what was spoken, but thought that He was only reflecting upon their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>But wherefore said He, <q>I have chosen you twelve, and one of you is a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></q>? It was to show that His teaching was entirely free from flattery. For that they might not think that He would flatter them, because when all had left Him they alone remained, and confessed by Peter that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, He leads them  away from such a suspicion. And what He says is of this kind. <q>Nothing abashes Me from rebuking the bad; think not that because you have remained I shall choose to flatter you, or that because you have followed Me I shall not rebuke the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For neither does another circumstance abash Me, which is much more powerful than this to abash a teacher. For he that remains affords a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his affection, while one that has been chosen by a teacher, being rejected, attaches to him a character for folly among senseless <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. Still neither does this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Me to refrain from My reproofs.</q> This at least even now the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> frigidly and senselessly urge against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For God is not wont to make men good by compulsion and force, neither is His election and choice compulsory on those who are called,  but persuasive.  And that you may learn that the calling compels not, consider how many of these who have been called have come to perdition, so that it is clear that it lies in our own will  also to be saved, or to perish.</p>

<p>5. Hearing therefore these things, learn we always to be sober and to watch. For if when he who was reckoned among that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> band, who had enjoyed so great a gift, who had wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, (for he too was with the others who were sent to raise the dead and to heal <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>,) if when he was seized by the dreadful disease of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and betrayed his Master, neither the favors, nor the gifts, nor the being with Christ, nor the attendance on Him, nor the <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washing the feet</a>, nor the sharing His table, nor the bearing the bag, availed him, if these things rather served to help on  his punishment, let us also <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest we ever through <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> imitate Judas. Thou betrayest not Christ. But when you neglect the poor man wasting with hunger, or perishing with cold, that man draws upon you the same condemnation.  When we partake of the Mysteries unworthily, we perish equally with the Christ-slayers. When we plunder, when we oppress  those weaker than ourselves, we shall draw down upon us severest punishment. And with reason; for how long shall the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of things present so occupy us, superfluous as they are and unprofitable? Since <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> consists in superfluities, in which no advantage is. How long shall we be nailed to vanities? How long shall we not look through and away into heaven, not be sober, not be satiated with these fleeting things of earth, not learn by experience their worthlessness? Let us think of those who before us have been <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>; are not all those things a dream? Are they not a shadow, a flower? Are they not a stream which flows by? A story and a tale? Such a man has been rich, and where now is his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>? It has gone, has perished, but the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> done by reason of it stay by him, and the punishment which is because of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Yea, surely if there were no punishment, if no kingdom were set before us, it were a duty to show regard for those of like descent and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, to respect those who have like feelings with ourselves. But now we feed dogs, and many of us wild asses, and bears, and different beasts, while we care not for a man perishing with hunger; and a thing alien to us is more valued than that which is of our kin, and our own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> less <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> than creatures which are not so, nor related to us.</p>

<p>Is it a fine thing to build one's self splendid houses, to have many servants, to lie and gaze at a gilded roof? Why then, assuredly, it is superfluous and unprofitable. For other buildings there are, far brighter and more majestic than these; on such we must gladden our eyes, for there is none to hinder us. Will you see the fairest of roofs? At eventide look upon the starred heaven. <q>But,</q> says some one, <q>this roof is not mine.</q> Yet in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> this is more yours than that other. For you it was made, and is common to you and to your brethren; the other is not yours, but theirs who after your death inherit it. &nbsp;The one may do you the greatest service, guiding you by its beauty to its Creator; the other the greatest harm, becoming your greatest accuser at the Day of Judgment, inasmuch as it is covered with gold, while Christ has not even needful raiment. Let us not, I entreat you, be subject to such folly, let us not pursue things which flee away, and flee those which endure; let us not betray our own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but hold fast to our hope of what shall be hereafter; the aged, as certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that but a little space of life is left us; the young, as well persuaded that what is left is not much. For that day comes so as a thief in the night. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> this, let wives exhort their husbands, and husbands admonish their wives; let us teach youths and maidens, and all instruct one another, to care not for present things, but to desire those which are to come, that we may be able also to obtain them; through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and loving-kindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, now and ever and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
