<h1>Homily 48 on the Acts of the Apostles</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse17">Acts XXII. 17-20</a></p>

<p><q>And it came to pass, that, when I had come again to Jerusalem, even while I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in the temple, I was in a trance; and saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get you quickly out of Jerusalem: for they will not receive your testimony concerning me. And I said, Lord, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I imprisoned and beat in every <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on you: and when the blood of your <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</q></p>

<p>See how he thrusts himself (into danger), I came, he says, after that vision, <q>to Jerusalem. I was in a trance,</q> etc. Again, this is without <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>: but observe, the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> follows from the result. He said, <q>They will not receive your testimony:</q> they did not receive it. And yet from calculations of reason the surmise should have been this, that they would assuredly receive him. For I was the man that made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: so that they ought to have received him. Here he establishes two things: both that they are without excuse, since they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him contrary to all likelihood or calculation of reason; and, that Christ was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as prophesying things contrary to expectation, and as not looking to past things, but fore-<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the things to come. How then does He say, <q>He shall bear My name before the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and kings and children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts 9:15</a></span> Not, certainly persuade. Besides which, on other occasions we find the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were persuaded, but here they were not. Where most of all they ought to have been persuaded, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> his former <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> (in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>), here they were not persuaded. <q>And when the blood of Your <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Stephen,</q> etc. See where again his discourse terminates, namely, in the forcible main point (<span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C2; &#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x1F31;&#x03C3;&#x03C7;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03C6;&#x1F71;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>): that it was he that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, and not only <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> but killed, nay, had he ten thousand hands (<span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03C2; &#x03C7;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03C3;&#x1F76;&#x03BD; &#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;&#x03C1;&#x1F65;&#x03BD;</span>) would have used them all to kill Stephen. He reminded them of the murderous spirit heinously indulged (by him and them). Then of course above all they would not endure him, since this convicted them; and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> was having its fulfilment: great the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, vehement the accusation, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves witnesses of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Christ! <q>And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send you far hence unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 21, 22.) The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>  would not endure to hear out all his harangue,  but excessively fired by their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, they shouted, it says, <q>Away with him; for it is not fit that he should live. And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw dust into the air, the tribune commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> wherefore they cried so against him.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 23, 24.) Whereas both the tribune ought to have examined whether these things were so&mdash; yes, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves too&mdash; or, if they were not so, to have ordered him to be scourged, he <q>bade examine him by scourging, that he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> they so clamored against him.</q> And yet he ought to have learned from those clamorers, and to have asked whether they laid hold upon anything of the things spoken: instead of that, without more ado he indulges his arbitrary will and pleasure, and acts with a view to gratify them: for he did not look to this, how he should do a righteous thing, but only how he might stop their rage unrighteous as it was. <q>And as they bound him with thongs,  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse25">Acts 22:25</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> lied not, God forbid: for he was a Roman:  if there was nothing else, he would have been afraid (to pretend this), lest he should be found out, and suffer a worse punishment. (See Sueton. Vit. Claud. &sect;25.) And observe he does not say it peremptorily (<span class="greek">&#x1F01;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BB;&#x1F65;&#x03C2;</span>), but, <q>Is it lawful for you?</q> The charges brought are two, both its being without examination, and his being a Roman. They held this as a great privilege, at that time: for they say that (it was only) from the time of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Hadrian</a> that all  were named Romans, but of old it was not so. He would have been contemptible had he been scourged: but as it is, he puts <em>them</em> into greater <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> (than they him). Had they scourged him, they would also have dismissed  the whole matter, or even have killed him; but as it is, the result is not so. See how God permits many (good results) to be brought about quite in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> way, both in the case of the Apostles and of the rest (of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>). Mark how they suspected the thing to be a pretext,  and that in calling himself a Roman, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> lied: perhaps surmising this from his poverty. <q>When the centurion heard that, he went and told the tribune, saying, Take heed what you do, for this man is a Roman. Then the tribune came, and said unto him, Tell me, are you a Roman? He said, Yea. And the tribune answered, With a great sum obtained I this freedom. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, But I was free born. Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the tribune also was afraid, after he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse26">Acts 22:26-29</a></span>&mdash; <q>But I,</q> he says, <q>was free born.</q> So then his father also was a Roman. What then comes of this? He bound him, and brought him down to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.  <q>On the morrow, because he would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the certainty whereof he was accused of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and all their council to appear, and brought <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> down, and set him before them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse30">Acts 22:30</a></span> He discourses not now to the multitude, nor to the people. <q>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> before God until this day.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse1">Acts 23:1</a></span> What he means is this: I am not conscious to myself of having wronged you at all, or of having done anything worthy of these bonds. What then said the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>?  Right <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and ruler-like, and mildly: <q>And the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth. Then said <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> unto him, God shall smite you, you whited wall: for do you sit to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law? And they that stood by said, Do you revile God's <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>? Then said <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, I knew not, brethren, that he was the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>: for it is written, You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the ruler of your people.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse3">Acts 23:3-5</a></span> Because <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that he was <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>.</q> Some say, Why then does he defend himself as if it was matter of accusation, and adds, <q>You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the ruler of your people?</q> For if he were not the ruler, was it right for no better reason than that to abuse (him or any) other? He says himself, <q>Being reviled, we bless; being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, we suffer it</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 4:12</a></span>; but here he does the contrary, and not only reviles, but curses.  They are the words of boldness, rather than of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; he did not choose to appear in a contemptible light to the tribune. For suppose the tribune himself had spared to scourge him, only as he was about to be delivered up to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, his being beaten by their servants would have more emboldened him: this is why <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does not attack the servant, but the person who gave the order. But that saying, <q>Thou whited wall, and do you sit to judge me after the law?</q> (is) instead of, Being (yourself) a culprit: as if he had said, And (yourself) worthy of stripes without number. See accordingly how greatly they were struck with his boldness; for whereas the point was to have overthrown the whole matter, they rather commend him.  (<em>infra</em>, v. 9.) <q>For it is written,</q> etc. He wishes to show that he thus speaks, not from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, nor because (Ananias) did not deserve to be called this, but from <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the law in this point also. And indeed I am fully persuaded that he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>,  since he had returned now after a long interval, and was not in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of constant intercourse with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; seeing him too in the midst among many others: for the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> was no longer easy to be seen at a glance, there being many of them and diverse.  So, it seems to me, in this also he spoke with a view to his plea against them: by way of showing that he does <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the law; therefore he (thus) exculpates himself.</p>

<p>(Recapitulation.) (<em>b</em>) But let us review what has been said. (<em>a</em>) <q>And when I was came again to Jerusalem,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse17">Acts 22:17</a></span> How was it,  that being a Jew, and there brought up and taught, he did not stay there? Nor did he abide there, unless he had a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to furnish numberless occasions against him: everywhere just like an exile, fleeing about from place to place. (<em>c</em>) <q>While I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in the temple,</q> he says, <q>it came to pass that I was in a trance.</q> (To show) that it was not simply a phantom of the imagination, therefore <q>while he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a></q> (the Lord) stood by him. And he shows that it was not from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of their dangers that he fled, but because they would <q>not receive</q> his <q>testimony.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse18">Acts 22:18</a></span> But why said he <q>They <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I imprisoned?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse19">Acts 22:19</a></span> Not to gainsay Christ, but because he wished to learn this which was so contrary to all reasonable expectation. Christ, however, did not teach him (this),  but only bade him depart, and he obeys: so <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> is he. <q>And they lifted up their voices,</q> it says, <q>and said, Away with him: it is not fit that this fellow should live.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse22">Acts 22:22</a></span> Nay, you are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> not fit to live; not he, who in everything obeys God. O villains and murderers! <q>And shaking out their clothes,</q> it says, <q>they threw dust into the air</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse23">Acts 22:23</a></span>, to make insurrection more fierce, because they wished to frighten the governor.  And observe; they do not say what the charge was, as in fact they had nothing to allege, but only think to strike terror by their shouting. <q>The tribune commanded,</q> etc. and yet he ought to have learned from the accusers, <q>wherefore they cried so against him. And as they bound him, etc. And the chief captain was afraid, after he learned that he was a Roman.</q> Why then it was no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. <q>On the morrow, because he would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the certainty wherefore he was accused of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, etc., he brought him down before the council.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse24">Acts 22:24-30</a></span> This he should have done at the outset. He brought him in, loosed. This above all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> would not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what to make of.  <q>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,</q> it says, <q>earnestly beholding them.</q> It shows his boldness, and how it awed them (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x1F10;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B5;&#x03C0;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>). <q>Then the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> Ananias.</q> etc. <span class="stiki">ch. 23:1, 2</span> Why, what has he said that was affronting? What is he beaten for? Why what hardihood, what shamelessness! Therefore (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) set him down (with a rebuke): <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall smite you thou whited wall.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse3">Acts 23:3</a></span> Accordingly (Ananias) himself is put to a stand, and dares not say a word: only those about him could not bear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> boldness. They saw a man ready to die  * * * for if this was the case, (<a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>) had but to hold his peace, and the tribune would have taken him, and gone his way; he would have <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> him to them. He both shows that he suffers willingly what he suffers, and thus excuses himself before them, not that he wished to excuse himself to them&mdash; since as for those, he even strongly condemns them&mdash; but for the sake of the people.  <q>Violating the law, do you command me to be beaten?</q> Well may he say so: for to kill a man who had done (them) no injury, and that an innocent person, was a violating of the law. For neither was it abuse that was spoken by him, unless one would call Christ's words abusive, when He says, <q>Woe unto you, <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, for you are like whited walls.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse27">Matthew 23:27</a></span> True, you will say: but if he had said it before he had been beaten, it would have betokened not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but boldness. But I have mentioned the reason of this.  And (at this rate) we often find Christ Himself <q>speaking abusively</q> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> when abused by them; as when He says, <q>Do not think that I will accuse you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse45">John 5:45</a></span> But this is not abuse, God forbid. See, with what gentleness he addresses these men: <q>I knew not,</q> he says, <q>that he was God's <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a></q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 4, 5): and, (to show) that he was not dissembling (<span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F30;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x1F7B;&#x03B5;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) he adds, <q>You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the ruler of your people.</q> He even confesses him to be still ruler. Let us also learn the gentleness also,  that in both the one and the other we may be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>. For one must look narrowly into them, to learn what the one is and what the other: narrowly, because these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have their corresponding <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> hard by them: mere forwardness passing itself off for boldness, mere cowardice for gentleness:  and need being to scan them, lest any person possessing the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> should seem to have the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: which would be just as if a person should fancy that he was cohabiting with the mistress, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was the servant-maid. What then is gentleness, and what mere cowardice? When others are wronged, and we do not take their part, but hold our peace, this is cowardice: when we are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> ill-treated, and we bear it, this is gentleness. What is boldness? Again the same, when others are the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for whom we contend. What forwardness? When it is in our own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that we are willing to fight. So that magnanimity and boldness go together, as also (mere) forwardness and (mere) cowardice. For he that (does not) resent on his own behalf,  will hardly but resent on behalf of others: and he that does not stand up for his own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, will hardly fail to stand up for others. For when our habitual disposition is pure from passion, it admits <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> also. Just as a body when free from fever admits strength, so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, unless it be corrupted by the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, admits strength. It betokens great strength, this gentleness; it needs a generous and a gallant <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and one of exceeding loftiness, this gentleness. Or, think you, is it a small thing to suffer ill, and not be exasperated? Indeed one would not <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> if in speaking of the disposition to stand up for our neighbors, one should call it the spirit of manly <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. For he that has had the strength to be able to overcome so strong a passion (as this of selfishness), will have the strength to dare the attack on another. For instance, these are two <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, cowardice and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: if you have overcome <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, it is very plain that you overcome cowardice also: but you get the mastery over <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, by being gentle: therefore (do so) with cowardice also, and you will be manly. Again, if you have not got the better of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, you have become forward and pugnacious; but not having got the better of this, neither can you get the better of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; consequently, you will be a coward too: and the case is the same as with the body; if it be weak, it is quickly overcome both by cold and heat: for such is the ill temperament, but the good temperament is able to stand all (changes). Again, greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and hard by it stands prodigality: economy is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the being a good manager; hard by it stands parsimony and meanness. Come, let us again collate and compare the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (with their <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>). Well, then, the prodigal person is not to be called great-minded. How should he? The man who is overcome by numberless <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, how should he be great of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? For this is not despising money; it is only the being ordered about by other <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: for just as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if he were at the beck and bidding of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their orders, could not be free (so it is here). His large spending does not come of his contempt of money, but simply from his not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how to dispose of it properly: else, were it possible both to keep it and to lay it out on his pleasure, this is what he would like. But he that spends his money on fit objects, this is the man of high <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a high <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that which is not in slavery to passion, which accounts money to be nothing. Again, economy is a good thing: for thus that will be the best manager, who spends in a proper manner, and not at random without management. But parsimony is not the same thing with this. For the former  indeed, not even when an urgent necessity demands, touches the principal of his money: but the latter will be brother to the former. Well, then, we will put together the man of great <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> economist, as also the prodigal and the mean man: for both of these are thus affected from littleness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as those others are (from the opposite). Let us not then call him high-souled, who simply spends, but him who spends aright: nor let us call the economical manager mean and parsimonious, but him who is unseasonably sparing of his money.</p>

<p>What a quantity of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> that rich man spent, <q>who was clothed in purple and fine linen?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse19">Luke 16:19</a></span> But he was not high-souled: for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was possessed by an unmerciful disposition and by numberless <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>: how then should it be great? <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> had a great <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, spending as he did for the reception of his guests, killing the calf, and, where need was, not only not sparing his property, but not even his life. If then we see a person having his sumptuous table, having his harlots and his parasites, let us not call him a man of a great <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but a man of an exceedingly little mind. For see how many <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> he is enslaved and subject to&mdash; <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, inordinate pleasure, flattery: but him who is possessed by so many, and cannot even escape one of them, how can any one call magnanimous? Nay, then most of all let us call him little-minded, when he spends the most: for the more he spends, the more does he show the tyranny of those <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: for had they not excessively got the mastery over him, he would not have spent to excess. Again, if we see a person, giving nothing to such people as these, but feeding the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and succoring those in need, himself keeping a mean table&mdash; him let us call an exceedingly high-souled man: for it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a mark of a great <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to despise one's own comfort, but to care for that of others. For tell me, if you should see a person despising all tyrants, and holding their commands of no account, but rescuing from their tyranny those who are oppressed and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> entreated; would you not think this a great man? So let us account of the man in this case also. The <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> are the tyrant: if then we despise them, we shall be great: but if we rescue others also from them, we shall be far greater, as being sufficient not only for ourselves, but for others also. But if any one, at a tyrant's bidding, beat some other of his subjects, is this greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? No, indeed: but the extreme of slavery, in proportion as he is great. And now also there is set before us (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03BA;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is a noble one and a free: but this the prodigal has ordered to be beaten by his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>: the man then that beats himself, shall we call high-souled? By no means. Well then * *, but let us see what is greatness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and what prodigality; what is economy, and what meanness; what is gentleness, and (what) dulness and cowardice; what boldness, and what forwardness: that having distinguished these things from each other, we may be enabled to pass (this life) well-pleasing to the Lord, and to attain unto the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things promised, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to Whom be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
