<h1>Homily 48 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 7:1-2</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>After these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for He would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill Him. Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.</q></div>

<p>1. Nothing is worse than <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; through these death entered into the world. For when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> saw man <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, he endured not his prosperity, but used every means to destroy him. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom 2:24</a></span> And from the same root one may everywhere see this same fruit produced. Thus Abel was slain; thus David, with many other just men, was like to have been so; from this also the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> became Christ-slayers. And declaring this the Evangelist said, <q>After these things Jesus walked in <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>; for He had not power  to walk in Jewry, because the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> sought to kill Him.</q> What do you say, O blessed John? Had not He <q>power,</q> who was able to do all that He would? He that said, <q>Whom do you seek?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse6">John 18:6</a></span> and cast them backward? He who was present, yet not seen <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse4">John 21:4</a></span>, had not He <q>power</q>? How then afterwards did He come among them in the midst of the temple, in the midst of the feast, when there was an assembly, when they that longed for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> were present, and utter those sayings which enraged them yet the more? Yea, this at least men marveled at, saying, <q>Is not this He, whom they seek to kill? And, lo, He speaks boldly, and they say nothing unto Him.</q> <span class="stiki">Ver. 25, 26</span> What mean these riddles? Away with the word!  The Evangelist spoke not so that he might be supposed to utter riddles, but to make it plain that He shows <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> both of His Godhead and His Manhood. For when he says, that <q>He had not power,</q> he speaks of Him as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, doing many things after the manner of men; but when he says, that He stood in the midst of them, and they seized Him not, he shows to us the power of the Godhead, (as man He fled, as God He appeared,) and in both cases he speaks <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>. To be in the midst of those who were plotting against Him, and yet not be seized by them, showed His unrivaled and irresistible nature; to yield strengthened and authenticated the Dispensation, that neither <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>,  nor <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>,  nor those affected with their maladies, might have anything to say. By this then he stops all  their mouths.</p>

<p><q>After these things was the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> feast of tabernacles.</q> The words, <q>after these things,</q> mean only, that the writer has here been concise, and has passed over a long interval of time, as is clear from this circumstance. When Christ sat  on the mountain, he says, that it was the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the Passover</a>;  while here the writer mentions the <q>feast of tabernacles,</q> and during the five months has neither related or taught us anything else, except the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> of the loaves, and the sermon made to those who ate them. Yet He ceased not to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and to converse, both in the day, and in the evening, and oftentimes at night; at least, it was thus that He presided over His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as all the Evangelists tell us. Why then have they omitted that interval? Because it was impossible to recount everything fully, and moreover, because they were anxious to mention those points which were followed  by any fault-finding or gainsaying of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. There were many circumstances like those which here are omitted; for that He raised the dead, healed the sick, and was admired, they have frequently recorded;  but when they have anything uncommon to tell, when they have to describe any charge seemingly put forth against Him, these things they set down; such as this now, that <q>His brethren <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Him not.</q> For a circumstance like this brings with it no slight suspicion, and it is worth our while to admire their truth-loving disposition, how they are not ashamed to relate things which seem to bring disgrace upon their Teacher, but have been even more anxious to report these than other matters. For instance, the writer having passed by many signs and wonders and sermons, has sprung at once to this.</p>

<h2>John 7:3-5</h2> <div class="h2a">For, says he, <q>His brethren said unto Him, Depart hence, and go into Jud&aelig;a, that Your disciples also may see the works that You do; for there is no man that does anything in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. Show yourself to the world. For neither did His brethren believe in Him.</q></div>

<p>2. What unbelief, says some one, is here? They exhort  Him to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. It is great deed; for of unbelief come their words, and their insolence, and their unseasonable freedom  of speech. For they thought, that owing to their relationship, it was lawful  for them to address Him boldly. And their request seems forsooth to be that of friends, but the words were those of great maliciousness.  For in this place they reproach Him with cowardice and vainglory: since to say, <q>no man does anything in secret,</q> is the expression of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> charging Him with cowardice, and suspecting the things done by Him as being not really done; and to add, that <q>he seeks to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>,</q> was to accuse Him of vainglory. But observe, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Of those who said these things, one became first Bishop of Jerusalem, the blessed James, of whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>Other of the Apostles saw I none, save James, the Lord's brother</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse19"Galatians 1:19</a></span>; and Judas also is said to have been a marvelous man. And yet these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> had been present also at <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a>, when the wine was made, but as yet they profited nothing. Whence then had they so great unbelief? From their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  and from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; for superiority among kindred is wont somehow to be envied by such as are not alike exalted. But who are those that they call <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> here? The crowd that followed Him, not the twelve. What then says Christ? Observe how mildly He answered; He said not, <q>Who are you that counsel and instruct Me thus?</q> but,</p>

<h2>John 7:6</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>My time is not yet come.</q></div>

<p>He here seems to me to hint at something other than He expresses; perhaps in their <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> they designed to deliver Him up to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and pointing out this to them, He says, <q>My time is not yet come,</q> that is, <q>the time of the Cross and the Death, why then hasten ye to slay Me before the time?</q></p>

<p><q>But your time is always ready.</q></p>

<p>As though He had said, <q>Though you be ever with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, they will not slay you who desire the same things with them; but Me they will straightway wish to kill. So that it is ever your time to be with them without danger, but My time is when the season of the Cross is at hand, when I must die.</q> For that this was His meaning, He showed by what followed.</p>

<h2>John 7:7</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>The world cannot hate you;</q> (how should it hate those who desire, and who run for the same objects as itself?) <q>but Me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</q></div>

<p><q>That is, because I upbraid and rebuke it, therefore I am <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>.</q> From this let us learn to master our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and not to give way to unworthy passion, though they be mean men who give us counsel. For if Christ meekly bore with unbelievers counseling Him, when their counsel was improper and not from any good intention, what pardon shall we obtain, who being but dust and ashes, yet are annoyed with those who counsel us, and deem that we are unworthily treated, although the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who do this may be but a little humbler than ourselves? Observe in this instance how He repels their accusation with all gentleness; for when they say, <q>Show Yourself to the world,</q> He replies, <q>The world cannot <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you, but Me the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a></q>; thus removing their accusation. <q>So far,</q> He says, <q>am I from seeking <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from men, that I cease not to reprove them, and this when I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that by this course <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> is produced against and death prepared for Me.</q> <q>And where,</q> asks some one, <q>did He rebuke men?</q> When did He ever cease to do so? Did He not say, <q>Think not that I will accuse you to the Father? There is one that accuses you, even <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse45">John 5:45</a></span> And again; <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, that you have not the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in you</q>: and <q>How can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, who receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from men,  and seek not the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that comes from God only?</q> Do you see how He has everywhere shown, that it was the open rebuke, not the violation of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, which caused the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> against Him?</p>

<p>And wherefore does He send them to the feast, saying,</p>

<h2>John 7:8</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Go ye up to the feast: I go not up yet.</q></div>

<p>To show that He said these things not as needing them, or desiring to be flattered  by them, but permitting them to do what pertained to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <q>How then,</q> says some one, <q>went He up after saying, 'I go not up'?</q> He said not, once for all,  <q>I go not up,</q> but, <q>now,</q> that is, <q>not with you.</q></p>

<p><q>For My time is not yet fulfilled.</q></p>

<p>And yet He was about to be crucified at the coming <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>. <q>How then went He not up also? For if He went not up because the time was not yet come, He ought not to have gone up at all.</q> But He went not up for this purpose, that He might suffer, but that He might instruct them. <q>But wherefore secretly? Since He might by going openly both have been amidst them, and have restrained their unruly impulses as He often did.</q> It was because He would not do this continually. Since had He gone up openly, and again blinded them,  He would have made His Godhead to shine through in a greater degree, which at present behooved not, but He rather concealed it.  And since they thought that His remaining was from cowardice, He shows them the contrary, and that it was from  confidence, and a dispensation,  and that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> beforehand the time when He should suffer, He would, when it should at length be at hand, be most desirous of going up to Jerusalem. And methinks by saying, <q>Go ye up,</q> He meant, <q>Think not that I compel you to stay with Me against your will,</q> and this addition of, <q>My time is not yet fully come,</q> is the expression of one declaring that <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> must be wrought and sermons spoken, so that greater multitudes might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> be made more steadfast by seeing the boldness and the sufferings of their Master.</p>

<p>3. Learn we then, from what has been said, His kindness and gentleness; <q>Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of heart</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew 11:29</a></span>; and let us cast away  all bitterness. If any exalt himself against us, let us be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>; if any be bold, let us wait upon him; if any bite and devour us with mocks and jests, let us not be overcome; lest in defending ourselves we destroy ourselves. For <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is a wild beast, a wild beast keen and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. Let us then repeat to ourselves  soothing charms drawn from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, and say, <q>You are earth and ashes.</q> <q>Why is earth and ashes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse9">Sirach 10:9</a></span>, and, <q>The sway of his fury shall be his destruction</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse22">Sirach 1:22</a></span>: and, <q>The wrathful man is not comely</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse25">Proverbs 11:25</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span>; for there is nothing more shameful, nothing uglier than a visage inflamed with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. As when you stir up mud there is an ill savor, so when a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is disturbed by passion there is great indecency and unpleasantness. <q>But,</q> says some one, <q>I endure not insult from mine enemies.</q> Wherefore? Tell me. If the charge be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then you ought, even before the affront, to have been pricked at heart, and thank your enemy for his rebukes; if it be false, despise  it. He has called you poor, laugh at him; he has called you base-born and foolish, then mourn for him; for <q>He that says to his brother, You fool, shall be in danger of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> fire.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew 5:22</a></span> Whenever therefore one insults you, consider the punishment that he undergoes; then shall you not only not be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, but shall even shed tears for him. For no man is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with one in a fever or inflammation, but pities and weeps for all such; and such a thing is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. Nay, if even thou desire to avenge yourself, hold your peace, and you have dealt your enemy a mortal blow; while if you add reviling to reviling, you have kindled a fire. <q>But,</q> says some one, <q>the bystanders accuse us of weakness if we hold our peace.</q> No, they will not condemn your weakness, but admire you for your wisdom. Moreover, if you are stung by insolence, you become insolent; and being stung, compel men to think that what has been said of you is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Wherefore, tell me, does a rich man laugh when he is called poor? Is it not because he is conscious that he is not poor? If therefore  we will laugh at insults, we shall afford the strongest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that we are not conscious of the faults alleged. Besides, how long are we to dread the accounts we render to men? How long are we to despise our common Lord, and be nailed to the flesh? <q>For whereas there is among you strife, and envying, and divisions, are you not carnal?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 3:3</a></span> Let us then become spiritual, and bridle this dreadful wild beast. Anger differs nothing from <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, it is a temporary <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, or rather it is a thing worse than having a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for one that has a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> may be excused, but the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> man deserves ten thousand punishments, voluntarily casting himself into the pit of destruction, and before the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> which is to come suffering punishment from this already, by bringing a certain restless turmoil and never silent  storm of fury, through all the night and through all the day, upon the reasonings of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Let us therefore, that we may deliver ourselves from the punishment here and the vengeance hereafter, cast out this passion, and show forth all meekness and gentleness, that we may find rest for our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> both here and in the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. To which may we all attain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, now and ever and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
