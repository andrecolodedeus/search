<h1>Homily 4 on the First Epistle of John</h1>

<h2>1 John 2:27-3:8</h2>

<p><q> <em>And it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and lies not. Even as it has taught you, abide in it. And now, little children, abide in Him; that, when He shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be put to shame by Him at His coming. If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is righteous, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that every one that does righteousness is born of Him. Behold, what manner of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called and should be the sons of God:</em>  <em>therefore the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> us not, because it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not Him, us also the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not. Beloved, now are we the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it is not yet manifested what we shall be. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And every man that has this hope in Him purifies himself, even as He is pure. Whosoever commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> commits also iniquity. Sin is iniquity. And ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He was manifested to take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and in Him is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Whosoever abides in Him <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not: whosoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has not seen Him, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him. Little children, let no man seduce you. He that does righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous. He that commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the beginning. For this purpose the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was manifested; that He might destroy the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</em></q></p>

<p>1. You remember, brethren, that yesterday's lesson was brought to a close at this point, that <q>you have no need that any man teach you, but the unction itself teaches you concerning all things.</q> Now this, as I am sure ye remember, we so expounded to you, that we who from without speak to your ears, are as workmen applying culture from without to a tree, but we cannot give the increase nor form the fruits: but only He that created and redeemed and called you, He, dwelling in you by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, must speak to you within, else vain is all our noise of words. Whence does this appear? From this: that while many hear, not all are persuaded of that which is said, but only they to whom God speaks within. Now they to whom He speaks within, are those who give place to Him: and those give place to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <q>give not place to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172185"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> wishes to inhabit the hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and speak there the things which are able to seduce. But what says the Lord Jesus? <q>The prince of this world is cast out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172186"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;12:31</a></span> Whence cast? Out of heaven and earth? Out of the fabric of the world? Nay, but out of the hearts of the believing. The invader being cast out, let the Redeemer dwell within: because the same redeemed, who created. And the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> now assaults from without, not conquers Him that has possession within. And he assaults from without, by casting in various <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>: but that person consents not thereto, to whom God speaks within, and the unction of which you have heard.</p>

<p>2. <q>And it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q> namely, this same unction; <em>i.e.</em> the very <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> which teaches men, cannot lie: <q>and is not false.  Even as it has taught you, abide ye in the same. And now, little children, abide ye in Him, that when He shall be manifested, we may have boldness in His sight, that we be not put to shame by Him at His coming.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172188"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:27-28</a></span> You see, brethren: we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Jesus whom we have not seen: they announced Him, that saw, that handled, that heard the word out of His own mouth; and that they might persuade all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> thereof, they were sent by Him, not dared to go of themselves. And whither were they sent? You heard while the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was read, <q>Go, preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to the whole creation which is under heaven.</q>  Consequently, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were sent <q>every where:</q> with signs and wonders to attest that what they spoke, they had seen. And we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him whom we have not seen, and we look for Him to come. Whoso look for Him by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> when He comes: those who are without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when that which now they see not has come, shall be ashamed. And that confusion of face shall not be for a single day and so pass away, in such sort as those are wont to be confounded, who are found out in some fault, and are scoffed at by their fellowmen. That confusion shall carry them that are confounded to the left hand, that to them it may be said, <q>Go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172190"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;25:31</a></span> Let us abide then in His words, that we be not confounded when He comes. For Himself says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to them that had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him: <q>If you shall abide in my word, then are you verily my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172191"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;8:3l,&nbsp;32</a></span> And, as if they had asked, With what fruit? <q>And,</q> says He, <q>you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall make you free.</q> For as yet our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is in hope, not in deed: for we do not already possess that which is promised, but we hope for it to come. And <q>faithful is He that promised;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172192"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse23">Hebrews&nbsp;10:23</a></span> He deceives not you: only do not faint, but wait for the promise. For He, the Truth, cannot deceive. Be not a liar, to profess one thing and do another; keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and He keeps His promise. But if you keep not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, your own self, not He that promised, has defrauded you.</p> 

<p>3. <q>If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is righteous, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye  that every one that does righteousness is born of Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172194"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:29</a></span> The righteousness which at present is ours is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Perfect righteousness is not, save only in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: and scarce in <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, if they be compared with God: yet if there be any perfect righteousness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and spirits which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created, it is in the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, just, good, by no lapse turned aside, by no <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> falling, but remaining ever in the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, and having nothing else sweet unto them save Him by whom they were created; in them is perfect righteousness: but in us it has begun to be, of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by the Spirit. You heard when the Psalm was read, <q>Begin  ye to the Lord in confession.</q>  <q>Begin,</q> says it; the beginning of our righteousness is the confession of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. You have begun not to defend your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; now have you made a beginning of righteousness: but it shall be perfected in you when to do nothing else shall delight you, when <q>death shall be swallowed up in victory,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172197"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:24</a></span> when there shall be no itching of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, when there shall be no struggling with flesh and blood, when there shall be the palm of victory, the triumph over the enemy; then shall there be perfect righteousness. At present we are still fighting: if we fight we are in the lists;  we smite and are smitten; but who shall conquer, remains to be seen. And that man conquers, who even when he smites presumes not on his own strength, but relies upon God that cheers him on. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is alone when he fights against us. If we are with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we overcome the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: for if you fight alone with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, you will be overcome. He is a skillful enemy: how may palms has he won! Consider to what he has cast us down! That we are born mortal, comes of this, that he in the first place cast down from Paradise our very original. What then is to be done, seeing he is so well practised? Let the Almighty be invoked to your aid against the devices of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Let Him dwell in you, who cannot be overcome, and you shall securely overcome him who is wont to overcome. But to overcome whom? Those in whom God dwells not. For, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, brethren; <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> being in Paradise despised the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and lifted up the neck, as if he desired to be his own master, and were loath to be subject to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: so he fell from that <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, from that blessedness. But there was a certain man, a man now well skilled, though a mortal born, who even as he sat on the dunghill, putrifying with worms, overcame the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: yea, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> himself then overcame: even he, in Job; because Job was of his race. So then, Adam, overcome in Paradise, overcame on the dunghill. Being in Paradise, he gave ear to the persuasion of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> had put into her: but being on the dunghill he said to Eve, <q>You have spoken as one of the foolish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172199"><a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse10">Job&nbsp;2:10</a></span> There he lent an ear, here he gave an answer: when he was glad, he listened, when he was scourged, he overcame. Therefore, see what follows, my brethren, in the Epistle: because this is what it would have us lay to heart, that we may overcome the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> indeed, but not of ourselves. <q>If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is righteous,</q> says it, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> ye that every one that does righteousness is born of Him:</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And in that he has said, <q>Is born of Him,</q> he cheers us on. Already therefore, in that we are born of Him, we are perfect.</p>

<p>4. Hear. <q>Behold what manner of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Father has given us, that we should be called sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be <span class="stiki" id="note172200"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:1</a></span> (such).</q>  For whoso are called sons, and are not sons, what profits them the name where the thing is not? How many are called physicians, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to heal! How many are called watchers, who sleep all night long! So, many are called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and yet in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are not found such; because they are not this which they are called, that is, in life, in manners, in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in hope, in charity. But what have ye heard here, brethren? <q>Behold, what manner of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called, and should be, the sons of God: therefore the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> us not, because it has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, us also the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not.</q>  There is a whole world <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and a whole world ungodly; because throughout the whole world there are ungodly, and throughout the whole world there are godly: those <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not these. In what sense, think we, do they not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them? They deride them that live good lives. Mark well and see: for haply there are such also among you. Each one of you who now lives godly, who despises worldly things, who does not choose to go to spectacles, who does not choose to make himself drunken as it were by solemn custom, yea, what is worse, under countenance of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> days to make himself unclean: the man who does not choose to do these things, how is he derided by those who do them!  Would he be scoffed at if he were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? But why is he not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? <q>The world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him not.</q> Who is <q>the world</q>? Those inhabiters of the world. Just as we say, <q>a house;</q> meaning, its inhabitants. These things have been said to you again and again, and we forbear to repeat them to your disgust. By this time, when you hear the word <q>world,</q> in a bad signification, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you must understand it to mean only lovers of the world because through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they inhabit, and by inhabiting have become entitled to the name. Therefore the world has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> us, because it has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him. He walked here Himself, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> in the flesh; He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He was latent in weakness.  And wherefore was He not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? Because He reproved all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in men. They, through loving the delights of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, did not acknowledge the God: through loving that which the fever prompted, they did wrong to the Physician.</p>

<p>5. For us then, what are we? Already we are begotten of Him; but because we are such in hope, he says, <q>Beloved, now are we sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Now already? Then what is it we look for, if already we are sons of God? <q>And not yet,</q> says he, <q>is it manifested what  we shall be.</q> But what else shall we be than sons of God? Hear what follows: <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is.</q> Understand, my beloved. It is a great matter: <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.</q> In the first place mark, what is called <q>Is.</q> You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what it is that is so called. That which is called <q>Is,</q> and not only is called but is so, is unchangeable: It ever remains, It cannot be changed, It is in no part corruptible: It has neither proficiency, for It is perfect; nor has deficiency, for It is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. And what is this? <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172206"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> And what is this? <q>Who being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172207"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> To see Christ in this sort, Christ in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, Only-Begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, equal with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is to the bad impossible. But in regard that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, the bad also shall have power to see Him: because in the day of judgment the bad also will see Him; for He shall so come to judge, as He came to be judged. In the selfsame form, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but yet God: for <q>cursed is every one that puts his trust in man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172208"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:5</a></span> A man, He came to be judged, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He will come to judge. And if He shall not be seen, what is this that is written, <q>They shall look on Him whom they pierced?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172209"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;19:37</a></span> For of the ungodly it is said, that they shall see and be confounded. How shall the ungodly not see, when He shall set some on the right hand, others on the left? To those on the right hand He will say, <q>Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172210"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> to those on the left He will say, <q>Go into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>.</q> They will see but the form of a servant, the form of God they will not see. Why? Because they were ungodly; and the Lord Himself says, <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172211"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> Therefore, we are to see a certain vision, my brethren, <q>which neither eye has seen, nor ear has heard, nor has entered into the heart of man:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172212"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> a certain vision, a vision surpassing all earthly beautifulness, of gold, of silver, of groves and fields; the beautifulness of sea and air, the beautifulness of sun and moon, the beautifulness of the stars, the beautifulness of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>: surpassing all things: because from it are all things beautiful.</p>

<p>6. What then shall <q>we</q> be, when we shall see this? What is promised to us? <q>We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</q> The tongue has done what it could, has sounded the words: let the rest be thought by the heart. For what has even John himself said in comparison of That which Is, or what can be said by us men, who are so far from being equal to his merits? Return we therefore to that unction of Him, return we to that unction which inwardly teaches that which we cannot speak: and because ye cannot at present see, let your part and duty be in desire. The whole life of a good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is an <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> desire.  Now what you long for, you do not yet see: howbeit by longing, you are made capable, so that when that has come which you may see, you shall be filled. For just as, if you would fill a bag,  and <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> how great the thing is that shall be given, you stretch the opening of the sack or the skin, or whatever else it be; you know how much you would put in, and see that the bag is narrow; by stretching you make it capable of holding more: so <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by deferring our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, stretches our desire; by the desiring, stretches the mind; by stretching, makes it more capacious. Let us desire therefore, my brethren, for we shall be filled. See <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> widening, as it were,  his bosom, that it may be able to receive that which is to come. He says, namely, <q>Not that I have already received, or am already perfect: brethren, I deem not myself to have apprehended.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172216"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;3:13-14</a></span> Then what are you doing in this life, if you have not yet apprehended? <q>But this one thing [I do]; forgetting the things that are behind, reaching forth to the things that are before,  upon the strain I follow on unto the prize of the high calling.</q> He says he reaches forth, or stretches himself, and says that he follows <q>upon the strain.</q> He felt himself too little to take in that <q>which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has entered into the heart of man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172218"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> This is our life, that by longing we should be exercised. But <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> longing exercises us just so much as we prune off our longings from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the world. We have already said, <q>Empty out that which is to be filled.</q> With good you are to be filled: pour out the bad. Suppose that God would fill you with honey: if you are full of vinegar, where will you put the honey? That which the vessel bore in it must be poured out: the vessel itself must be cleansed; must be cleansed, albeit with labor, albeit with hard rubbing, that it may become fit for that thing, whatever it be. Let us say honey, say gold, say wine; whatever we say it is, being that which cannot be said, whatever we would fain say, It is called&mdash; God. And when we say <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> what have we said? Is that one syllable the whole of that we look for? So then, whatever we have had power to say is beneath Him: let us stretch ourselves unto Him, that when He shall come, He may fill us. For <q>we shall be like Him; because we shall see Him as He is.</q></p>

<p>7. <q>And every one that has this hope in Him.</q> You see how he has set us our place, in <q>hope.</q> You see how the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> agrees with his fellow-apostle, <q>By hope we are saved. But hope that is seen, is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he hope for? For if what we see not, we hope for, by patience we wait for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172219"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24-25</a></span> This very patience exercises desire. Continue, for He continues: and persevere in walking, that you may reach the goal: for that to which you tend will not remove. See: <q>And every one that has this hope in Him, purifies  himself even as He is pure.</q>  See how he has not taken away <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, in that he says, <q>purifies himself.</q> Who purifies us but God? Yea, but God does not purify you if you be unwilling. Therefore, in that you join your will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that you purify yourself. Thou purifiest yourself, not by yourself, but by Him who comes to inhabit you. Still, because you do somewhat therein by the will, therefore is somewhat attributed to you. But it is attributed to you only to the end you should say, as in the Psalm, <q>Be my helper, forsake me not.</q>  If you say, <q>Be my helper,</q> you do somewhat: for if you be doing nothing, how should He be said to <q>help</q> you?</p>

<p>8. <q>Every one that does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, does also iniquity.</q>  Let no man say, Sin is one thing, iniquity another: let no man say, I am a sinful man, but not  a doer of iniquity. For, <q>Every one that does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, does also iniquity. Sin is iniquity.</q> Well then, what are we to do concerning <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and iniquities? Hear what He says: <q>And ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He was manifested to take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Him is not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172225"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> He, in Whom <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not, the same has come to take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For were there <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Him, it must be taken away from Him, not He take it away Himself. <q>Whosoever abides in Him, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172226"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:6</a></span> In so far as he abides in Him, in so far <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not. <q>Whosoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has not seen Him, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him.</q> A great question this: <q>Whosoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has not seen Him, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him.</q> No marvel. We have not seen Him, but are to see; have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him, but are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>: we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in One we have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Or haply, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and by actual beholding  have not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>? But then in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we have both seen and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> does not yet see, why are we said to have been enlightened? There is an enlightening by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and an enlightening by sight. At present, while we are on pilgrimage, <q>we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not by sight,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172228"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span> or, actually beholding. Therefore also our righteousness is <q>by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not by sight.</q> Our righteousness shall be perfect, when we shall see by actual beholding.  Only, in the meanwhile, let us not leave that righteousness which is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since <q>the just does live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172230"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;1:17</a></span> as says the apostle. <q>Whosoever abides in Him, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not.</q> For, <q>whosoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, has not seen Him, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him.</q> That man who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, believes not: but if a man believes, so far as pertains to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not.</p>

<p>9. <q>Little children, let no man seduce you. He that does righteousness is righteous, as He is righteous.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172231"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:7</a></span> What, on hearing that we are <q>righteous as He is righteous,</q> are we to think ourselves equal with God? You must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what means that <q>as:</q> thus he said a while ago, <q>Purifies himself even as He is pure.</q> Then is our purity like and equal to the purity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and our righteousness to God's righteousness? Who can say this? But the word <q>as,</q> is not always wont to be used in the sense of equality. As, for example, if, having seen this large church,  a person should wish to build a smaller church, but with the same relative dimensions: as, for example, if this be one measure in width and two measures in length, he too should build his church one measure in width and two measures in length: in that case one sees that he has built it <q>as</q> this is built. But this church has, say, a hundred cubits in length, the other thirty: it is at once <q>as</q> this, and yet unequal. You see that this <q>as</q> is not always referred to parity and equality. For example, see what a difference there is between the face of a man and its image from a mirror: there is a face in the image, a face in the body: the image exists in imitation, the body in reality. And what do we say? Why, <q>as</q> there are eyes here, so also there; <q>as</q> ears here, so ears also there. The thing is different, but the <q>as</q> is said of the resemblance. Well then, we also have in us the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but not that which the Son equal with the Father has: yet except we also, according to our measure, were <q>as</q> He, we should in no respect be said to be like Him. <q>He purifies us,</q> then, <q>even as He is pure:</q> but He is pure from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, we pure by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We are <q>righteous even as He is righteous;</q> but He is so in His immutable perpetuity, we righteous by believing on One we do not see, that so we may one day see Him. Even when our righteousness shall be perfect, when we shall be equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not even then shall it be equalled with Him. How far then is it from Him now, when not even then it shall be equal!</p>

<p>10. <q>He that does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the beginning.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172233"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> <q>Is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>:</q> ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he means: by imitating the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> made no man, begot no man, created no man: but whoso imitates the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that person, as if begotten of him, becomes a child of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; by imitating him, not literally by being begotten of him. In what sense are you a child of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, not that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> begot you? In the same sense as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the children of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, not imitating the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, have become children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: of the flesh of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> they were begotten, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> they have not imitated. If then those who were thence begotten were put out of the inheritance, because they did not imitate, you, who art not begotten of him, art made a child, and in this way shall be a child of him by imitating him. And if you imitate the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in such wise as he became <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and impious against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you will be a child of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: by imitating, not that he created you or begot you.</p>

<p>11. <q>Unto this end was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> manifested.</q> Now then, brethren, mark! All sinners are begotten of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as sinners. <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: but when he consented to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, he was begotten of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; and he begot all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> such as he was himself. With <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> itself we were born; even before we add our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, from that condemnation we have our birth. For if we are born without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, wherefore this running with infants to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that they may be released? Then mark well, brethren, the two birth-stocks,  <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and Christ: two men are; but one of them, a man that is man; the other, a Man that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By the man that is man we are sinners; by the Man that is God we are justified. That birth has cast down unto death; this birth has raised up unto life: that birth brings with it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; this birth sets free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For to this end came Christ as Man, to undo  the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of men. <q>Unto this end was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> manifested, that He may undo the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q></p>

<p>12. The rest I commend to your thoughts, my beloved, that I may not burden you. For the question we labor to solve is even this&mdash; that we call ourselves sinners: for if any man shall say that he is without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he is a liar. And in the Epistle of this same John we have found it written, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172236"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> For you should remember what went before: <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> And yet, on the other hand, in what follows you are told, <q>He that is begotten of God <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not: he that does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has not seen Him, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him.&mdash; Every one that does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>:</q> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not of God: this affrights us again. In what sense are we begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in what sense do we confess ourselves sinners? Shall we say, because we are not begotten of God? And what do these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">Sacraments</a> in regard to infants? What has John said? <q>He that is begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not.</q> And yet again the same John has said, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us!</q> A great question it is, and an embarrassing one; and may I have made you intent upon having it solved, my beloved. Tomorrow, in the name of the Lord, what He will give, we will discourse thereof.</p>
