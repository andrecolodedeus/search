<h1>Homily 51 on the Acts of the Apostles</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Acts XXIV. 22, 23</p>

<p><q>And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that way, he deferred them and said, When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the uttermost of your matter. And he commanded a centurion to keep <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.</q></p>

<p>See how much close investigation is made by the many in a long course of time, that it should not be said that the trial was hurried over. For, as the orator had made mention of Lysias, that he took <q>him away with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, Felix,</q> he says, <q>deferred them. Having <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that way:</q> that is, he put them off on purpose: not because he wanted to learn, but as wishing to get rid of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. On their account, he did not like to let him go: to punish him was not possible; that would have been (too) barefaced. <q>And to let him have liberty,  and to forbid none of his acquaintance to minister to him.</q> So entirely did he too acquit him of the charges. Howbeit, to gratify them, he detained him, and besides, expecting to receive money, he called for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. <q>And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and heard him concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And as he reasoned of righteousness, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> (i.e. self-control or <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>), and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you. He hoped also that money should have been given him of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that he might loose him; wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix's room: and Felix, willing to show the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a pleasure, left <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bound.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act024.htm#verse24">Acts 24:24-27</a></span> See how close to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are the things written. But he sent for him frequently, not that he admired him, nor that he praised the things spoken, nor that he wished to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but why? <q>Expecting,</q> it says, <q>that money should have been given him.</q> Observe how he does not hide here the mind of the judge. <q>Wherefore he sent for him,</q> etc. And yet if he had condemned him, he would not have done this, nor have wished to hear a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, condemned and of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> character. And observe <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, how, though reasoning with a ruler, he says nothing of the sort that was likely to amuse and entertain, but (<q>he reasoned,</q> it says,) <q>of righteousness, and of the coming judgment,</q> and of the resurrection. And such was the force of his words, that they even terrified the governor.  This man is succeeded in his office by another, and he leaves <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> a prisoner: and yet he ought not to have done this; he ought to have put an end to the business: but he leaves him, by way of gratifying them. They however were so urgent, that they again besought the judge. Yet against none of the Apostles had they set themselves thus pertinaciously; there, when they had attacked, anon they desisted. So providentially is he removed from Jerusalem, having to do with such wild beasts. And they nevertheless request that he might be brought again there to be tried. <q>Now when Festus had come into the province, after three days he ascended from C&aelig;sarea to Jerusalem. Then the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and the chief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> informed him against <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and besought him, and desired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse1">Acts 25:1-3</a></span> Here now God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> interposed, not permitting the governor to do this: for it was natural that he having just come to the government would wish to gratify them: but God suffered him not. <q>But Festus answered, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> should be kept at C&aelig;sarea, and that he himself would depart shortly there. Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, if there be any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in him. And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto C&aelig;sarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be brought.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse4">Acts 25:4-6</a></span> But after they came down, they immediately made their accusations shamelessly and with more vehemence: and not having been able to convict him on grounds relating to the Law, they again according to their custom stirred the question about C&aelig;sar, being just what they did in Christ's case. For that they had recourse to this is manifest by the fact, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> defends himself on the score of offenses against C&aelig;sar. <q>And when he had come, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, which they could not prove. While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, neither against the temple, nor yet against C&aelig;sar, have I offended anything at all. But Festus, willing to do the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a pleasure, answered <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse7">Acts 25:7-9</a></span> Wherefore he too gratifies the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the whole people, and the city. Such being the case, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> terrifies him also, using a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weapon for his defence. <q>Then said <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, I stand at C&aelig;sar's judgment seat, where I ought to be judged; to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have I done no wrong, as you very well <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>. For if I be an offender, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto C&aelig;sar.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 10, 11.) Some one might say, How is it, that having been told, <q>You must also bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse11">Acts 23:11</a></span>, he, as if unbelieving, did this? God forbid: nay, he did it, because he so strongly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For it would have been a tempting of God to be bold on account of that declaration, and to cast himself into numberless dangers, and to say: <q>Let us see if God is able even thus to deliver me.</q> But not so does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; no, he does his part, all that in him lies, committing the whole to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Quietly also he reproves the governor: for, <q>If, says he, I am an offender, you do well: but if not, why do you give me up?</q> <q>No man,</q> he says, <q>may <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> me.</q> He put him in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, so that even if he wished, he could not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> him to them; while also as an excuse to them he had <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> appeal to allege. <q>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Have you appealed unto C&aelig;sar? Unto C&aelig;sar shall you go. And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto C&aelig;sarea to salute Festus.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 12, 13.) Observe, he communicates the matter to Agrippa, so that there should be other hearers once more, both the king, and the army, and Bernice. Thereupon a speech in his exculpation. <q>And when they had been there many days, Festus declared <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix: about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and the elders of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> informed me, desiring to have judgment against him. To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him. Therefore, when they had come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth. Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed: but had certain questions against him of their own <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> affirmed to be alive. And because I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters. But when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to C&aelig;sar. Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, you shall hear him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse14">Acts 25:14-22</a></span> And observe a crimination of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, not from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but also from the governor. <q>Desiring,</q> he says, <q>to have judgment against him.</q> To whom I said, to their shame, that <q>it is not the manner of the Romans,</q> before giving an opportunity to speak for himself, <q>to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> But I did give him (such opportunity), and I found no fault in him. <q>Because I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>,</q> says he, of <q>such manner of questions:</q> he casts a veil also over his own wrong. Then the other desires to see him. (<em>b</em>) But let us look again at what has been said. </p>

<p>(Recapitulation.) <q>And when Felix,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act024.htm#verse22">Acts 24:22</a></span> Observe on all occasions how the governors try to keep off from themselves the annoyance of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and are often compelled to act contrary to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and seek pretexts for deferring: for of course it was not from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that he deferred the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it. And his wife also hears, together with the governor. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act024.htm#verse24">Acts 24:24</a></span> This seems to me to show great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. For he would not have brought his wife to be present with him at the hearing, but that he thought great things of him. It seems to me that she also longed for this. And observe how <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> immediately discourses not only about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor about remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but also about practical points of duty. <q>Go your way,</q> he says, <q>for this time: when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act024.htm#verse25">Acts 24:25</a></span> Observe his hardness of heart: hearing such things, <q>he hoped that he should receive money from him!</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act024.htm#verse26">Acts 24:26</a></span> And not only so, but even after conversing with him&mdash; for it was towards the end of his government&mdash; he left him bound, <q>willing to show the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> a pleasure</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act024.htm#verse27">Acts 24:27</a></span>: so that he not only <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> money, but also <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. How, O wretch, can you look for money from a man who preaches the contrary? But that he did not get it, is evident from his leaving him bound; he would have loosed him, had he received it. <q>Of <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>,</q> it says, he reasoned; but the other was hankering to receive money from him who discoursed these things! And to ask indeed he did not dare: for such is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>: but he hoped it. <q>And when two years were completed,</q> etc., so that it was but natural that he showed them a pleasure, as he had been so long governor there. <q>Now when Festus had come into the province,</q> etc. <span class="stiki">ch. 25:1, 2</span> At the very beginning, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> came to him, who would not have hesitated to go even to C&aelig;sarea, unless he had been seen immediately coming up, since immediately on his arrival they come to him. And he spends ten days,  in order, I suppose, to be open to those who wished to corrupt him with <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. <q>They besought him,</q> it says, <q>that he would send for him:</q> why did they desire it as a favor, if he was deserving of death? But thus their plotting became evident even to him, so that discoursing of it (to Agrippa), he says, <q>desiring to have judgment against him.</q> They wanted to induce him to pass sentence now immediately, being afraid of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> tongue. What are you afraid of? What are you in such a hurry? In fact, that expression, <q>that he should be kept</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse4">Acts 25:4</a></span>, shows this. Does he want to escape? <q>Let them therefore,</q> he says, <q>which among you are able, accuse him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse5">Acts 25:5</a></span> Again accusers, again at C&aelig;sarea, again <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is brought forth. And having come, immediately <q>he sat on the judgment-seat</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse6">Acts 25:6</a></span>; with all his haste: they so drove, so hurried him. While as yet he had not got acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor experienced the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> paid to him by them, he answered rightly: but now that he had been in Jerusalem ten days, he too wants to pleasure them (by <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to them): then, also to receive <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>Will you,</q> says he, <q>be judged there of these things by me?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse9">Acts 25:9</a></span> I am not giving you up to them&mdash; but this was the fact&mdash; and he leaves the point to his own choice, that by this mark of respect he might get him to yield: since his was the sentence,  and it would have been too barefaced, when he had been convicted of nothing here, to take him back there. <q>But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, At C&aelig;sar's tribunal am I standing,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse10">Acts 25:10</a></span>: he did not say, I will not, lest he should make the judge more vehement, but (here) again is his great boldness: They cast me out once for all, themselves, and by this they think to condemn me, by their showing that I have offended against C&aelig;sar: at his bar I choose to be judged, at the bar of the injured person himself. <q>To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have I done no wrong, as thou also very well <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a>.</q> Here now he reproved him, that he too wished to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> him to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: then, on the other hand, he relaxes (the sternness of) his speech: <q>if then I be an offender, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die.</q> I utter sentence against myself. For along with boldness of speech there must be also justness of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, so as to abash (the hearer). <q>But if there be nothing in the things whereof these accuse me, no man</q>&mdash; however he may wish it&mdash; <q>no man may <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> me to please them.</q> He said, not, I am not worthy of death, nor, I am worthy to be acquitted, but, I am ready to take my trial before C&aelig;sar. At the same time too, remembering the dream, he was the more confident to appeal. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse11">Acts 23:11</a></span> And he said not, Thou (may not), but, neither any other man may <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> me, that it might be no affront to him. <q>Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council</q>&mdash; do you observe how he seeks to gratify them? For this is favor&mdash; <q>having conferred,</q> it says, <q>with the council, he said, Have you appealed unto C&aelig;sar? Unto C&aelig;sar shall you go.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse12">Acts 25:12</a></span> See how his trial is again lengthened out, and how the plot against him becomes an occasion for the preaching: so that with ease and in safe custody he should be taken away to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>,  with none to plot <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against him: for it was not the same thing his simply coming there, and his coming on such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For, in fact this was what made the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> come together there. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse17">Acts 28:17</a></span> Then again, some time passes while he tarries at Jerusalem, that you may learn, that, though some time passed, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> design against him prevails nothing, God not permitting it. But this king Agrippa, who was also a <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, was a different Agrippa, after him of James' time, so that this is the fourth (<a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>). See how his enemies co&ouml;perate with him against their will. To make the audience large, Agrippa falls into a desire of hearing: and he does not simply hear, but with much parade. And see what a vindication (<span class="greek">&#x03B1;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;</span>)! So writes Festus,  and the ruthlessness of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> is openly made a show of: for when it is the governor that says these things, he is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> above all suspicion: so that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are condemned by him also. For, when all had pronounced sentence against them, then, and not sooner, God brings upon them the punishment. But observe: Lysias gave it against them, Felix against them, Festus against them&mdash; although he wished to gratify them &mdash; Agrippa against them. What further? The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>&mdash; even they gave it against themselves. No <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, says Festus, <q>of such things as I supposed: no accusation did they bring against him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse18">Acts 25:18</a></span> And yet they did bring it: <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but they did not prove it: for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> design and daring plot against him gave <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to surmise this, but the examination brought out nothing of the kind. <q>And of one Jesus,</q> he says, <q>which was dead.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse19">Acts 25:19</a></span> He says naturally enough, <q>of one</q> (Jesus), as being a man in office, and not caring for these things. <q>And not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, for my part, what to make of the enquiry concerning these things</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse20">Acts 25:20</a></span>&mdash; of course, it went beyond a judge's hearing, the examining into these matters. If you are at a loss, why do you drag him to Jerusalem? But the other would not deign this: no, <q>To C&aelig;sar</q> (says he); as in fact it was touching C&aelig;sar that they accused him. Do you hear the appeal? Hear the plotting of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Hear their factious spirit? All these things provoked him to a desire (of hearing him): and he gives them the gratification and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> becomes more renowned. For such as I said, are the ill designs (of enemies). Had not these things been so, none of these rulers would have deigned to hear him, none would have heard with such quietness and silence. And he seems indeed to be teaching, he seems to be making a defence; but he rather makes a public harangue with much orderliness. Then let us not think that ill designs against us are a grievous thing. So long as we do not make ill designs against ourselves, no one will be able to have ill designs against us: or rather, people may do this, but they do us no hurt; nay, even benefit us in the highest degree: for it rests with ourselves, whether we shall suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or not suffer <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Lo! I testify, and proclaim with a loud voice, more piercing even than the sound of a trumpet&mdash; and were it possible to ascend on high and cry aloud, I would not shrink from doing it&mdash; him that is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, none of all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings that inhabit the earth will have power to hurt. And why do I say, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings? Not even the Evil Spirit himself, the tyrant, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>, can do this, unless the man injure himself; be what it may that any one works, in vain he works it. For even as no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being could hurt an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, if he were on earth, so neither can one <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being hurt another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being. But neither again will he himself be able to hurt another, so long as he is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. What then can be equal to this, when neither to be hurt is possible, nor to hurt another? For this thing is not less than the former, the not wishing to hurt another. Why, that man is a kind of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, yea, like God. For such is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; only, He indeed (is such) by nature, but this man, by moral choice: neither to be hurt is possible (for either), nor to hurt another. But this thing, this <q>not possible,</q> think not that it is for any want of power&mdash; for the contrary to this is want of power&mdash; no, I speak of the morally incompatible (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;&#x03B4;&#x03B5;&#x03BA;&#x03C4;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span>). For the (Divine) Nature is neither Itself susceptible of hurt, nor capable of hurting another: since this very thing in itself is a hurt. For in no other way do we hurt ourselves, than by hurting another, and our greatest <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> become such from our doing injury to ourselves. So that for this reason also the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> cannot be hurt, namely, because neither can he hurt. But how in hurting others we hurt ourselves, come, let us take this saying in hand for examination in detail. Let a man wrong another, insult, overreach; whom then has he hurt? Is it not himself first? This is plain to every one. For to the one, the damage is in money, to himself, it is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; to destruction, and to punishment. Again, let another be <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>: is it not himself he has injured? For such is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>: to its own author first it does incalculable hurt. <q>Yes,  but to another also?</q> True, but nothing worth considering: or rather, not even a little&mdash; nay, it even benefits him. For let there be&mdash;as the whole matter lies most in these examples&mdash;let there be some poor man, having but little property and (barely) provided with necessary food,  and another rich and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, and having much power, and then let him take the poor man's property, and strip him naked, and give him up to starvation, while he shall luxuriate in what he has <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> taken from the other: not only has he not hurt that man at all&mdash; he has even benefited him, while himself he has not only not benefited, but even hurt. For how should it be otherwise? In the first place, harassed by an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and day by day condemning himself and being condemned by all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: and then, secondly, in the judgment to come. But the other, how is he benefited? Because to suffer ill and bear it nobly, is great gain: for it is a doing away of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, this suffering of ill, it is a training to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, it is a discipline of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Let us see which of the two is in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> case, this man or that. For the one, if he be a man of well-ordered <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, will bear it nobly: the other will be every day in a constant tremor and misgiving: which then is hurt, this man or that? <q>You talk idly,</q> say you: <q>for when a man has nothing to eat, and is forced to bewail himself and to feel himself very wretched, or comes and begs, and gets nothing, is not that a ruining of both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body?</q> No, it is you that talk idly: for I show facts in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. For say, does none of the rich feel himself wretched? What then? Is poverty the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his wretchedness? <q>But he does not starve.</q> And what of that? The greater is the punishment, when having riches he does this. For neither does <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> make a man strong-minded, nor poverty make him weak: otherwise none of those living in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> would pass a wretched life, nor would any of those in poverty (not) curse his <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. But that yours is indeed the idle talk, I will make manifest to you from hence. Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in poverty or in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>? Did he suffer hunger, or did he not? You may hear himself saying, <q>In hunger and thirst.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse27">2 Corinthians 11:27</a></span> Did the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> suffer hunger, or did they not? They too had a hard time of it. <q>Again, you fetch up <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to me, again the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, some ten or twenty men.</q> But whence shall I bring examples? <q>Show me from the many some who bear ills nobly.</q> But  the rare is ever such: however, if you will, let us examine the matter as it is in itself. Let us see whose is the greater and sharper care, whose the more easy to be borne. The one is solicitous about his necessary food, the other about numberless matters, freed from that care. The rich man is not afraid on the score of hunger, but he is afraid about other things: oftentimes for his very life. The poor man is not free from anxiety about food, but he is free from other anxieties, he has safety, has quietness, has security.</p>

<p>If to injure another is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but a good, wherefore are we ashamed? Wherefore do we cover our faces? Wherefore, being reproached, are we vexed and disconcerted? If the being injured is not a good thing, wherefore do we <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> ourselves, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the thing, and justify ourselves on its account? Would you learn how this is better than that? Observe those who are in the one condition, and those who are in the other. Wherefore are <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>? Wherefore are courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>? Wherefore punishments? Is it not, on account of those men, as being diseased and unsound? But the pleasure lies great, you will say. Let us not speak of the future: let us look into the present. What is worse than a man who is under such a suspicion as this? What more precarious? What more unsound? Is he not always in a state of shipwreck? Even if he do any just thing, he is not credited, condemned as he is by all on account of his power (of injuring): for in all who dwell with him he has accusers: he cannot enjoy friendship: for none would readily choose to become the friend of a man who has such a character, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of becoming implicated with him in the opinion held of him. As if he were a wild beast, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> turn away from him; as from a pest, a foe, a man-slayer, and an enemy of nature, so they shrink from the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> man. If he who has wronged another happen to be brought into a court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, he does not even need an accuser, his character condemns him in place of any accuser. Not so he who is injured; he has all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to take his part, to condole with him, to stretch out the hand of help: he stands on safe ground. If to injure another be a good and a safe thing, let any one confess that he is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>: but if he dares not do this, why then does he pursue it as a good thing? But let us see in our own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, if his same be done there, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> come of it: (I mean,) if any of the parts or functions within us having overstepped its proper bounds, grasp at the office of some other. For let the spleen, if it will, have left its proper place, and seize on the part belonging to some other organ along with its own, is not this disease? The moisture within us, let it fill every place, is it not dropsy and gout?  is not this to ruin itself, along with the other? Again, let the bile seek for a wide room, and let the blood be diffused throughout every part. But how is it in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and all the rest, if the food exceed its proper measure? Again in the body, if the eye wish to take in more, or to see more than is allotted to it, or admit a greater light than is proper. But if, when the light is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet the eye is ruined, if it choose to see more than is right: consider what it must be in the case of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing. If the ear take in a (too) loud voice, the sense is stunned: the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, if it reason about things above itself, it is overpowered: and whatever is in excess, mars all. For this is <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BB;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03BE;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>, the wanting to have more than what is marked off and allotted. So too in respect of money; when we will needs put upon (us) more burdens (than is meet), although we do not perceive it, to our sore hurt we are nourishing within ourselves a wild beast; much having, yet much wanting, numberless the cares we entangle ourselves withal, many the handles we furnish the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> against ourselves. In the case of the rich, however, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has not even need of labor, so surely do their very concerns of business of themselves ruin them. Wherefore I beseech you to abstain from the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of these things, that we may be enabled to escape the snares of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one, and having taken hold of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, to attain unto the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with Whom to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> together be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> forever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
