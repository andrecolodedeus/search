<h1>Homily 51 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 7:37-38</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>In the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. He that believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</q></div>

<p>1. They who come to the divine preaching and give heed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, must manifest the desire of thirsty men for water, and kindle in themselves a similar longing; so will they be able also very carefully to retain what is said. For as thirsty men, when they have taken a bowl, eagerly drain it and then desist, so too they who hear the divine oracles if they receive them thirsting, will never be weary until they have drunk them up. For to show that men ought ever to thirst and hunger, <q>Blessed,</q> It says, <q>are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse6">Matthew 5:6</a></span>; and here Christ says, <q>If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink.</q> What He says is of this kind, <q>I draw no man to Me by necessity and constraint; but if any has great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, if any is inflamed with desire, him I call.</q></p>

<p>But why has the Evangelist remarked that it was <q>on the last day, that great day</q>? For both the first day and the last were <q>great,</q> while the intermediate days they spent rather in enjoyment. Wherefore then says he, <q>in the last day</q>? Because on that day they were all collected together. For on the first day He came not, and told the reason to His brethren, nor yet on the second and third days says He anything of this kind, lest His words should come to nought, the hearers being about to run into indulgence. But on the last day when they were returning home He gives them supplies  for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and cries aloud, partly by this showing to us His boldness, and partly for the greatness of the multitude. And to show that He spoke not of material drink, He adds, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</q> By <q>belly</q> he here means the heart, as also in another place It says, <q>And Your Law in the midst of my belly.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa039.htm#verse10">Psalm 40:10</a>; Theodotion</span> But where has the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> said, that <q>rivers of living water shall flow from his belly</q>? Nowhere. What then means, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says</q>? Here we must place a stop, so that the, <q>rivers shall flow from his belly,</q> may be an assertion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  For because many said, <q>This is the Christ</q>; and, <q>When the Christ comes will He do more <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>?</q> He shows that it behooves to have a correct <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and to be convinced not so much from the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as from  the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. Many, in fact, who even saw Him working marvels received Him not as Christ, and were ready to say, <q>Do not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> say that Christ comes of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>?</q> and on this they  continually dwelt. He then, desiring to show that He did not shun the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, again referrs them to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. He had said before, <q>Search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John 5:39</a></span>; and again, <q>It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be taught of God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John 6:45</a></span>; and, <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> accuses you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse45">John 5:45</a></span>; and here,<q> As the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has said, rivers shall flow from his belly,</q> alluding to the largeness and abundance of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. As in another place He says, <q>A well of water springing up unto <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John 4:14</a></span>, that is to say, <q>he shall possess much <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></q>; and elsewhere He calls it, <q><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life,</q> but here, <q>living water.</q> He calls that <q>living</q> which ever works; for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, when it has entered into the mind and has been established, springs up more than any fountain, fails not, becomes not empty, stays not. To signify therefore at once its unfailing supply and unlimited  operation, He has called it <q>a well</q> and <q>rivers,</q> not one river but numberless; and in the former case He has represented its abundance by the expression, <q>springing.</q> And one may clearly perceive what is meant, if he will consider the wisdom of Stephen, the tongue of Peter, the vehemence of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, how nothing bare, nothing withstood them, not the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of multitudes, not the risings up of tyrants, not the plots of devils, not daily deaths, but as rivers borne along with a great rushing sound, so they went on their way hurrying all things with them.</p>

<h2>John 7:39</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>But this spoke He of the Spirit, which they that believe in Him should receive; for the Holy Ghost was not yet given.</q></div>

<p>2. How then did the Prophets prophesy and work those ten thousand wonders? For the Apostles cast not out devils by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but by power received from Him; as He says Himself, <q>If I by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse27">Matthew 12:27</a></span> And this He said, signifying that before the Crucifixion  not all cast out devils by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but that some did so by the power received from Him. So when  He was about to send them, He said, <q>Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John 20:22</a></span>; and again, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> came upon them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse6">Acts 19:6</a></span>, and then they wrought <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. But when  He was sending them, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> said not, that <q>He gave to them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> but that He gave to them <q>power,</q> saying, <q>Cleanse the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, cast out devils, raise the dead, freely you have received, freely give.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse1">Matthew 10:1-8</a></span> But in the case of the Prophets, all allow that the Gift was that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. But this Grace was stinted and departed and failed from off the earth, from the day in which it was said, <q>Your house is left unto you desolate</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse38">Matthew 23:38</a></span>; and even before that day its dearth had begun, for there was no longer any <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> among them, nor did Grace visit their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>  things. Since then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> had been withheld, but was for the future to be shed forth abundantly, and since the beginning of this imparting was after the Crucifixion, not only as to its abundance, but also as to the increased greatness of the gifts, (for the Gift was more marvelous, as when It says, <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what Spirit you are of</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse55">Luke 9:55</a></span>; and again, <q>For you have not received the Spirit of bondage, but the Spirit of adoption</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse15">Romans 8:15</a></span>; and the men of old possessed the Spirit themselves, but imparted It not to others, while the Apostles filled tens of thousands with It,) since then, I say, they were to receive this Gift, but It was not yet given, for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> he adds, <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not yet.</q> Since then the Lord spoke of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,  the Evangelist has said, <q>For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not yet,</q> that is, <q>was not yet given,</q></p>

<p><q>Because Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q></p>

<p>Calling the Cross, <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> For since we were enemies, and had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and fallen short of the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and were haters of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and since <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of our reconciliation, and since a gift is not given to those who are <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, but to friends and those who have been well-pleasing; it was therefore necessary that the Sacrifice should first be offered for us, that the enmity (against God) which was in our flesh should be done away, that we should become friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so receive the Gift. For if this was done with respect to the promise made to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, much more with respect to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> has declared, saying, <q>If they which are of the Law be heirs, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made void&mdash; because the Law works <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse14">Romans 4:14-15</a></span> What he says, is of this kind: God promised that He would give the earth to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and to his seed: but his descendants were unworthy of the promise, and of their own <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> could not be well-pleasing unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On this account came in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, an easy action, that it might draw <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> unto it, and that the promise might not fail. And It says,</p>

<p><q>Therefore it is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that it might be by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to the end the promise might be sure.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse16">Romans 4:16</a></span> Wherefore it is by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, since by their own labors they prevailed not.</p> 

<p>But wherefore after saying, <q>according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>,</q>  did He not add the testimony? Because their mind was corrupt; for,</p>

<h2>John 7:40-42</h2>  <div class="h2a"><q>Some said, This is the Prophet. Others said, He deceives the people;  others said, Christ comes not from Galilee, but from the village of Bethlehem.</q></div>

<p>Others said, <q>When Christ comes, no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whence He is</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse27">John 7:27</a></span>; and there was a difference of opinion, as might be expected in a confused  multitude; for not attentively did they listen to His words, nor for the sake of learning. Wherefore He makes them no answer; yet they said, <q>Does Christ come out of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>?</q> And He had praised, as being <q>an Israelite indeed,</q> Nathanael, who had said in a more forcible and striking manner, <q>Can there any good thing come out of <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse46">John 1:46</a></span> But then these men, and they who said to <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>, <q>Search and look, for out of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> arises no <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse52">John 7:52</a></span>, said it not seeking to learn, but merely to overturn the opinion concerning Christ. Nathanael said this, being a lover of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> exactly all the ancient histories; but they looked only to one thing, and that was to remove the opinion that He was the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, on which account He revealed nothing to them. For they who even contradicted themselves, and said at one time, <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whence He comes,</q> at another, <q>From <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>,</q> would manifestly even if they had been informed have opposed Him. For be it that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the place of His birth, that He was from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, because of His dwelling  in <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a>, (yet this cannot be allowed, for He was not born there,) were they <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of His race also, that He was <q>of the house and lineage of David</q>? How then said they, <q>Does not Christ come of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse42">John 7:42</a></span> Because they wished to conceal even this fact by that question, saying all that they said with malicious intent. Why did they not come to Him and say, <q>Since we admire you in other respects, and you bid us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, tell us how it is that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> say that Christ must come from <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, when you have come from <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a>?</q> But they said nothing of the kind, but all in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. And to show that they spoke not enquiringly, nor as desiring to learn, the Evangelist straightway has added, that,</p>

<h2>John 7:44</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Some of them would have taken Him, but no man laid his hand upon Him.</q></div>

<p>This, if nothing else, might have been sufficient to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> compunction in them, but they felt it not, as the Prophet says, <q>They were cleft asunder, and were not pricked in heart.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa034.htm#verse15">Psalm 35:15</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span></p>

<p>3. Such a thing is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>! It will give way to nothing, it looks to one thing only, and that is, to destroy the person against whom it plots. But what says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>? <q>Whoso digs a pit for his neighbor, shall fall into it himself.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro026.htm#verse27">Proverbs 26:27</a></span> Which was the case then. For they desired to kill Him, to stop, as they thought, His preaching; the result was the opposite. For the preaching flourishes by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while all that was theirs is quenched and perished; they have lost their country, their freedom, their security, their worship, they have been deprived of all their prosperity, and have become slaves and captives.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> then this, let us never plot against others, aware that by so doing we whet the sword against ourselves, and inflict upon ourselves the deeper wound. Hath any one grieved you, and desires thou to avenge yourself on him? Avenge not yourself; so shall you be able to be avenged; but if you avenge yourself, you are not avenged. Think not that this is a riddle, but a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> saying. <q>How, and in what way?</q> Because if you avenge not yourself on him, you make God his enemy; but if you avenge yourself, no longer so. <q>Vengeance is Mine, I will repay, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse19">Romans 12:19</a></span> For if we have servants, and they having quarreled  with each other, do not give place to us for judgment and for punishment, but take it upon themselves; though they come to us ten thousand times, we not only shall not avenge them, but shall even be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them, saying, <q>Thou runaway, you flogging-post, you ought to have submitted all to us, but since you have prevented us and avenged yourself, trouble us no farther</q>; much more shall <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has bidden us commit all unto Him, say this. For how can it be otherwise than absurd, when we demand from our servants so much minding of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, but will not yield to our Master in those matters in which we desire our domestics to yield to us? This I say because of your readiness to inflict punishment one upon another. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> wise man ought not to do this even, but to pardon and forgive offenses, though there were not that great reward proposed, the receiving in return forgiveness. For, tell me, if you condemn one who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, wherefore do you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> yourself, and fall into the same fault? Hath he insulted? Insult not thou again, or you have insulted yourself. Hath he struck? Strike not thou again, for then there is no difference between you. Hath he vexed you? Vex him not again, for the profit is  nothing, and you will in your turn be placed on an equality with those who have wronged you. Thus, if you bear with meekness and gentleness, you shall be able to reprove your enemy, to shame him, to weary  him of being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. No man cures <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with good. These rules of wisdom give some of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; now if there be such wisdom among the foolish <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, let us be ashamed to show ourselves inferior to them. Many of them have been injured, and have borne it; many have been maliciously accused, and not defended themselves; have been plotted against, and have repaid by benefits. And there is no small <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest some of them be found in their lives to be greater than we, and so render our punishment severer. For when we who have partaken of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, we who look for the Kingdom, who follow wisdom for the sake of heavenly things,  who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> (not) <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and are bidden to become <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who enjoy the Mysteries; when we reach not to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> unto which they have attained, what pardon  shall we have? If we must go beyond the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, (for, <q>Unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew 5:20</a></span>) much more the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>; if the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, much more the unbelievers. Since if when we go not beyond the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the Kingdom is shut against us, how shall we be able to attain unto it when we prove ourselves worse than the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>?
