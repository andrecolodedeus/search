<h1>Homily 52 on the Acts of the Apostles</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse23">Acts XXV. 23</a></p>

<p>"And on the morrow, when Agrippa had come, and Bernice with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was brought forth.</p>

<p>See what an audience is gathered together for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Having collected all his guards, the governor has come, and the king, and the tribunes, <q>with the principal men,</q> it says, <q>of the city.</q> Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> being brought forth, see how he is proclaimed as conqueror. Festus himself acquits him from the charges, for what says Festus? <q>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> which are here present with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer. But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him. Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse24">Acts 25:24-27</a></span> Mark how he accuses them, while he acquits him. O what an abundance of justifications! After all these repeated examinations, the governor finds not how he may condemn him. They said he was worthy of death. On this account he said also: <q>When I found,</q> says he <q>that he had committed nothing worthy of death.&mdash; Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord.</q> This too is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> spotlessness, that the judge found nothing to say concerning him. <q>Therefore I have brought him forth,</q> he says, <q>before you. For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crime laid against him.</q> Such were the great straits into which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> brought themselves and their rulers! What then? <q>Agrippa said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, You are permitted to speak for yourself.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse1">Acts 26:1</a></span> From his great desire to hear, the king permits him to speak. But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaks out immediately with boldness, not flattering, but for this reason saying that he is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, namely, because (Agrippa) <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all. <q>Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself. I think myself <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before you touching all the things whereof I am accused of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Especially because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you to be expert in all questions which are among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: wherefore I beseech you to hear me patiently.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 2, 3.) And yet, had he been conscious of guilt, he should have feared at being tried in the presence of one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all the facts: but this is a mark of a clear <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, not to shrink from a judge who has an accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the circumstances, but even to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and to call himself <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. <q>I beseech you,</q> he says, <q>to hear me patiently.</q> Since he is about to lengthen out his speech, and to say something about himself, on this account, he premises an entreaty, and (then) says: <q>My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of our religion I lived a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 4, 5.) Then how should I have become a seditious person, who when young was (thus) testified of by all? Then too from his <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>: <q>after the most straitest <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a></q> says he, <q>of our religion I lived.</q> <q>What then, if though the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> indeed be worthy of admiration, you are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>?</q> Touching this also I call all to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>&mdash; touching my life and conversation. <q>And now I stand and am judged for the <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12453a.htm">promise</a> made of God unto our fathers: unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should raise the dead?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse6">Acts 26:6-8</a></span> Two arguments he lays down for the Resurrection: one, the argument from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>: and he does not bring forward any <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> (in particular,) but the doctrine itself as held by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: the other and stronger one, the argument from the facts&mdash; (especially from this,) that Christ Himself held discourse with him. And he lays the ground for this by (other) arguments, relating accurately his former <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. Then too, with high commendation of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he says, <q>Night and day,</q> says he, <q>serving (God) look to attain unto.</q> So that even if I had not been of unblemished life, it is not for this (doctrine) that I ought to be brought to trial:&mdash; <q>for which hope, king Agrippa, I am accused of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> And then another argument <q>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should raise the dead?</q> Since, if such an opinion had not <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, if they had not been brought up in these <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, but they were now for the first time brought in, perhaps  some one might not have received the saying. Then he tells, how he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>: this also helps the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>: and he brings forward the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> as witnesses, and the <q>strange cities,</q> and that he heard Him saying to him, <q>It is hard for you to kick against the pricks,</q> and shows the mercifulness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that, though being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> He appeared (to men), and did that benefit not to me only, but also sent me as teacher to others: and shows also the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, now come to pass, which he then heard, <q>Delivering you from the people, and from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, unto whom I send you.</q> Showing all this, he says: I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> did I shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, having received authority from the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; and when they were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and compelled them to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>; and being exceedingly mad against them, I <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> them even unto strange cities. Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? It is hard for you to kick against the pricks. And I said, Who are You, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom you persecute, but rise, and stand upon your feet: for I have appeared unto you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> both of these things which you have seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto you: delivering you from the people, and from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, unto whom now I send you, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that they may receive forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse9">Acts 26:9-18</a></span>:&mdash; observe  how mildly he discourses&mdash; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he says, said (this) to me, <q>that they may receive forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is in Me.</q> By these things, says he, I was persuaded, by this vision He drew me to Himself, and so persuaded me, that I made no delay. <q>Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: but showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and then to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that they should repent and turn to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do works meet for repentance.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 19, 20.) I therefore, who instructed others also concerning the most excellent way of living, how should I myself have become the author of sedition and contention? <q>For these causes the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. Having therefore obtained help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did say should come.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 21, 22.) See how free from flattery his speech is, and how he ascribes the whole to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then his boldness&mdash; but neither do I now desist: and the sure grounds&mdash; for it is from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that I urge the question, <q>Whether the Christ was to suffer:</q> then  the Resurrection and the promise, <q>Whether He, as the first to rise from the dead, should show light unto the people and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse23">Acts 26:23</a></span> Festus saw the boldness, and what says he? For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was all along addressing himself to the king&mdash; he was in a manner annoyed,  and says to him, <q>You are beside yourself, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>:</q> for, <q>while he thus discoursed, Festus said with a loud voice, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, you are beside yourself: much learning does make you mad.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse24">Acts 26:24</a></span> What then says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? With gentleness, <q>I am not mad,</q> says he, <q>most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and soberness.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse25">Acts 26:25</a></span> Then too he gives him to understand why, turning from him, he addressed his speech to the king: <q>For the king <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him: for this thing was not done in a corner.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse26">Acts 26:26</a></span> He shows, that (the king) <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all perfectly; at the same time, all but saying to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, And ye indeed ought to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> these things&mdash; for this is the meaning of that which he adds, <q>For this thing was not done in a corner. And Agrippa, said to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1FBF;</span> <span class="greek">&#x0395;&#x03BD; &#x1F40;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03B3;&#x1FF3;</span> you persuade me to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> What is <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD; &#x1F40;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03B3;&#x1FF3;</span>?  Within a little, <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x1F70; &#x03BC;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03BD;</span> . <q>And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, I could <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x1F10;&#x03BD; &#x1F40;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03B3;&#x1FF3; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x1F10;&#x03BD; &#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03BB;&#x1FA5;</span>, (that is) <q>I could <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> for my part, not <q>in little</q> (but <q>in much</q>): he does not simply <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> (not briefly, but) with largeness&mdash; <q>that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were such as I am.</q>  Then he adds, <q>except these bonds;</q> and yet it was matter of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but looking to their notion of it, therefore says he, <q>except these bonds.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse27">Acts 26:27-29</a></span></p>

<p>(Recapitulation.) <q>And on the morrow,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse23">Acts 25:23</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> desisted ever since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> exercised his right of appeal.  Then also for him the theatre becomes a splendid one: <q>with great pomp</q> they were present. <q>And Festus said,</q> etc. The whole multitude of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>&mdash; not some of them only, and others not so&mdash; <q>both at Jerusalem, and also here,</q> they said <q>that he ought not to live any longer.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse24">Acts 25:24</a></span> <q>And I having found,</q> etc. It shows that he did right in appealing to C&aelig;sar. For if  though they had no great matter to allege against him, yet those (at Jerusalem) were mad against him, with good reason may he go to C&aelig;sar. <q>That after examination had by you,</q> he says, <q>I may get somewhat to write.</q> Observe how the matter is repeatedly put to the test. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore may thank themselves for this vindication  (of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>), which would come to the ears of those also who were at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. See how they become the unwilling heralds both of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, even to the emperor himself: so that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was carried away (to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>) with more renown than if he had gone there without bonds: for not as an <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> and a deceiver, after so many judges had acquitted him, was he now carried there. Quit therefore of all charges,  among those with whom he was bred and born, and not only so, (but) thus free from all suspicion, he makes his appearance at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. <q>Then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse1">Acts 26:1-3</a></span> And he said not, Why is this? Once for all I have appealed to C&aelig;sar: I have been tried many times: when will there be an end of this? But what did he? Again he is ready to render an account, and that, before the man who was the best informed on the subject; and with much boldness, seeing they were not his judges to condemn him: but still, though they were not his judges, since that declaration was in force, Unto C&aelig;sar shall you go, he renders an account and gives full answers, <q>touching all the things,</q> and not merely on one and another here and there. They accuse me of sedition, accuse me of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, accuse me that I have profaned the temple: <q>touching all these things I answer for myself:</q> now that these are not things in accordance with my ways, my accusers themselves are witnesses: <q>my manner of life from my youth,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse4">Acts 26:4</a></span> which is what he says on a former occasion <q>Being a zealot.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse3">Acts 22:3</a></span> And when the whole people was present, then he challenges their testimony: not  before the tribunal, but before Lysias, and again here, when more were present: whereas in that hearing there needed not much vindication of himself, since Lysias' letter exculpated him. <q>Know all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,</q> he says, <q>which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> me from the beginning.</q> And he does not say what kind of life his was, but leaves it to their own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and lays the whole stress on his <em><a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a></em>, as he would not have chosen that <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, if he had been a man of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition and bad character (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C1;&#x1F78;&#x03C2; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C7;&#x03B8;&#x03B7;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C2;</span>). <q>But, for this hope</q> (manuscripts and Edd. <span class="greek">&#x03B1;&#x1F31;&#x03C1;&#x1F73;&#x03C3;&#x03B5;&#x03C9;&#x03C2;</span>) he says, <q>I stand and am judged.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 6, 7.) This hope is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> among themselves also, because of this they <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, because of this they worship, that unto this they may attain: this same do I show forth. Why then, it is acting like madmen, to be doing all things for the sake of attaining to this, and yet to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> him who believes in the same. <q>I indeed thought with myself,</q> that is, I determined, <q>to do many things contrary to the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse9">Acts 26:9</a></span> I was not one of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>: among those who fought against Him, was I. Whence also he is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> who has a right to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, because he, a man who was doing numberless things, makes <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> on the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, persuading them to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>, stirring up all against them, cities, rulers, and by himself doing all this of his own accord, was thus suddenly changed. Then again the witnesses, those who were with him: next he shows what just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> he had to be persuaded, both from the light, and from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and from the results, and from the things which have now taken place. See accordingly, how both from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and from these particulars, he confirms the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to them. For that he may not seem to be broaching some novelty, although he had great things to say, yet he again takes refuge with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and puts this as a question for discussion.  Now this had a stronger claim upon belief, as having actually come to pass: but since he alone saw (Christ), he again fetches <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of it from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And see how he does not discourse alike in the court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and in the assembly (of his own people); there indeed he says, <q>ye slew Him:</q> but here no such thing, that he might not kindle their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> more: but he shows the same thing, by saying, <q>Whether the Christ was to suffer.</q> He so frees them from accusations: for the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, he says, say this. Therefore receive ye also the rest. Since he has mentioned the vision, he then without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> goes on to speak also of the good wrought by it. <q>To turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For to this end have I appeared unto you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse16">Acts 26:16-18</a></span>, not to punish, but to make you an Apostle. He shows the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which possess unbelievers, <q><a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, darkness;</q> the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things belonging to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, light, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>the inheritance of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Whereupon, O king Agrippa,</q> etc. (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 19, 20.) He not only exhorts them to repent, but also to show forth a life worthy of admiration. And see how everywhere the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are admitted into connection with the people (<a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>): for those who were present were of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. <q>Testifying,</q> he says, <q>both to great and small,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse22">Acts 26:22</a></span> that is, both to distinguished and undistinguished. This is also for the soldiers. Observe: having left the post of defendant, he took up that of teacher&mdash; and therefore also it is that Festus says to him, <q>You are beside yourself</q>&mdash; but then, that he may not seem to be himself the teacher, he brings in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>Whether the Christ was to suffer, whether He as the first to rise from the dead should show light both to the people, and to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse23">Acts 26:23</a></span> <q>And Festus said with a loud voice</q>&mdash; in such <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and displeasure (did he speak)&mdash; <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, you are beside yourself.</q> What then said <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? <q>I am not mad,</q> etc. <q>For this thing,</q> he says, <q>was not done in a corner.</q> (<!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->v. 25, 26.) Here he speaks of the Cross, of the Resurrection: that the doctrine had come to every part of the world. <q>King Agrippa,</q> he says, <q>do you believe</q>&mdash; he does not say, the Resurrection, but&mdash; <q>the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse27">Acts 26:27</a></span> Then he forestalls him, and says: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you believe?</q> <span class="greek">&#x1FBF;</span> <span class="greek">&#x0395;&#x03BD; &#x1F40;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03B3;&#x1FF3;</span> (i.e. within a little,) <q>almost thou persuades the to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse28">Acts 26:28</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did not understand what the phrase <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BD; &#x1F40;&#x03BB;&#x1F77;&#x03B3;&#x1FF3;</span> meant: he thought it meant <span class="greek">&#x1F10;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BE; &#x1F40;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C5;</span> (i.e. with little cost or trouble), wherefore also he answers (as) to this: so unlearned was he.  And he said not, I do not wish (that), but, <q>I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that not only thou, but also all that hear.</q> Mark how free from flattery his speech is.&mdash; <q>I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that this day they may be all such as I am, except these bonds.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse29">Acts 26:29</a></span> He, the man that glories in his bonds, that puts them forth as a golden chain, deprecates them for these men: for they were as yet too weak in their minds, and it was rather in condescension that he so spoke. For what could be better than those bonds which always in his Epistles he prefers (to all things else), saying, <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a prisoner of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>:</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse1">Ephesians 3:1</a></span> and again, <q>On this account I am bound with this chain</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse20">Acts 28:20</a></span>, <q>but the word of God is not bound;</q> and, <q>Even unto bonds, as an evil-doer.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse9">2 Timothy 2:9</a></span> The punishment was twofold. For if indeed he had been so bound, as with a view to his good, the thing would have carried with it some consolation: but now (he is bound) both <q>as an evil-doer,</q> and as with a view to very ill consequences; yet for none of these things cared he. </p>

<p>Such is a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> winged with heavenly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For if those who cherish the foul (earthly passion which men call) <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, think nothing either <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> of precious, but those things alone which tend to gratify their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, they think both <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, and their mistress is everything to them; much more do those, who have been taken captive by this heavenly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, think nothing of the cost (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F70; &#x1F10;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C4;&#x1F77;&#x03BC;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>). But if we do not understand what I am saying, it is no marvel, while we are unskilled in this Divine Wisdom. For if any one be caught with the fire of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, he becomes such as a man would become who dwelt alone upon the earth, so utterly careless is he for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> or disgrace: but just as if he dwelt alone, he would care for nothing, no more does he in this case. As for trials, he so despises them, both scourges and imprisonments, as though the body in which he suffers these things were another's and not his own, or as though he had got a body made of adamant: while as for the sweet things of this life, he so laughs them to scorn, is so insensible to them, as we are insensible of dead bodies, being ourselves dead. He is as far from being taken captive by any passion, as the gold refined in the fire and purified is free from alloy. For even as flies would not dart into the midst of a flame, but fly from it, so the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> dare not even to come near this man. Would that I could bring forward examples of all this from among ourselves: but since we are at a loss for such, we must needs betake ourselves to this same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Observe him then, how he felt towards the whole world. <q>The world is crucified unto me,</q> he says, <q>and I unto the world</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians 6:14</a></span>: I am dead to the world, and the world is dead to me. And again: <q>It is no longer I that live, but Christ lives in me.</q>  <span class="stiki">ib. <a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20"Galatians 2:20</a></span> And, to show you that he was as it were in solitude, and so looked upon the things present, hear himself saying, <q>While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 4:18</a></span> What do you say? Answer me. And yet what you say is the contrary; you see the things invisible, and the visible you see not. Such eyes as you had gotten, such are the eyes which are given by Christ: for as these bodily eyes see indeed the things that are seen, but things unseen they see not: so those (heavenly eyes) do the contrary: none that beholds the invisible things, beholds the visible: no one beholding the things seen, beholds the invisible. Or is not this the case with us also? For when having turned our mind inwards we think of any of the unseen things, our views become raised above the things on earth.  Let us despise <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: let us be willing to be laughed at rather than to be praised. For he indeed who is laughed at is nothing hurt: but he who is praised is much hurt. Let us not think much of those things which terrify men, but as we do in the case of children, this let us do here: namely, if we see any one terrifying children, we do not hold that man in admiration: since in fact whoever does frighten, only frightens children; for were it a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he could not frighten him. Just as those who frighten (children in sport), do this either by drawing up their eyelids, or by otherwise distorting their face, but with the eye looking naturally and mild they would not be able to do this: so these others do this, by distorting their mental vision (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F78; &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F78;&#x03BD; &#x03C4;&#x1F25;&#x03C2; &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;</span>). So that of a mild man and beautiful in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> nobody would be afraid; on the contrary, we all respect him, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and venerate him. See ye not, how the man who causes terror is also an object of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> and abhorrence to us all? For of those things which are only able to terrify what do we not turn away from? Is it not so with wild beasts, with sounds, with sights, with places, with the air, such as darkness? Let us not therefore think it a great thing, if men <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> us. For, in the first place, no man indeed is frightened at us: and, secondly, it is no great thing (if they were). Virtue is a great good: and see how great. However wretched we may deem the things by means of which it consists, yet we admire <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself, and count them blessed (that have it). For who would not count the patient sufferer blessed, although poverty and such like things seem to be wretched? When therefore it shines forth through those things which seem to be wretched, see how surpassingly great this is! Do you think much, O man, because you are in power? And what sort of power? Say, was it conferred by appointment? (If so,) of men you have received power: appoint yourself to it from within. For the ruler is not he who is so called, but he who is really so. For as a king could not make a physician or an orator, so neither can he make a ruler: since it is not the (imperial) letters nor the name that makes a ruler. For, if you will, let any man build a medicine-shop, let him also have pupils, let him have instruments too and drugs, and let him visit those who are sick: are these things sufficient to make a physician? By no means: but there is need of art, and without that, not only do these things profit nothing, but they even hurt: since it were better that he who is not a physician should not even possess medicines. He that possesses them not, neither saves nor destroys: but he that possesses them, destroys, if he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how to use them: since the healing power is not only in the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the medicines, but also in the art of the person applying them: where this is not, all is marred. Such also is the ruler: he has for instruments, his voice, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, executioners, banishments, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, gifts, and praises; he has also for medicines, the law; has also for his patients, men; for a place to practise in, the court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; for pupils, he has the soldiers: if then he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the science of healing, all these profit him nothing. The judge is a physician of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, not of bodies: but if this art of healing the bodies needs so much care, much more that of healing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is of more importance than the body. Then not the mere having the name of ruler is to be a ruler: since others also are called by great names: as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Peter, James, and John: but the names do not make them that which they are called, as neither does my name make me (to be that which John was); I bear indeed the same name with that blessed man, but I am not the same thing (<span class="greek">&#x1F41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03BC;&#x1F7D;&#x03BD;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50; &#x03BC;&#x1F74;&#x03BD; &#x03C3;&#x03C5;&#x03BD;&#x1F7D;&#x03BD;&#x03C5;&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>), I am not John, but am called so. In the same way they are not rulers, but are called so. But those others are rulers even without these adjuncts, just as also a physician, though he may not actually practise his science, yet if he have it in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, he is a physician. Those are rulers, who bear rule over themselves. For there are these four things,  <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; city, world: and the things form a regular progression (<span class="greek">&#x1F41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03B4;&#x1FA5; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03B2;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;&#x03BD;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;</span>). He therefore that is to superintend a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and order it well, must first bring his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into order; for it is his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>: but if he cannot order his own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, where there is but one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, where he himself is master, where he is always along with himself, how shall he order others? He that is able to regulate his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and makes the one part to rule, the other to be subject, this man will be able to regulate a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> also: but he that can do this by a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, can do it by a city also: and if by a city, then also by the world. But if he cannot do this for his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, how then shall he be able to do it for the world? These things have been spoken by me, that we may not be excited about offices of rule; that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what ruling is: for this (which is so called) is not ruling, but a there object of derision, mere slavery, and many other names one might call it by. Tell me, what is proper to a ruler? Is it not to help one's subjects, and to do them good? What then, if this be not the case? How shall he help others, who has not helped himself? He who has numberless tyrannies of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, how shall he root out those of others? Again, with respect to <q>luxury</q> or delightful living: the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> luxury or delight is not this (which is so called), but quite another thing. For as we have shown that the ruler is not he who is so called, but another (who has something more than the name), so the person who lives indeed in delight is another sort of person (than he whom we so describe). For <q>luxury</q> or delightful living seems indeed to be, the enjoying pleasure and the gratifying the belly: yet it is not this thing, but the contrary: it is, to have a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> worthy of admiration, and to be in a state of pleasure. For let there be a man eating, drinking, and wantoning; then let him suffer cares and loss of spirits: can this man be said to be in a state of delight? Therefore, it is not eating and drinking, it is the being in pleasure, that makes <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> luxury or delightful living. Let there be a man who gets only dry bread, and let him be filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>: is not this pleasure? Well then, it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> luxury. Let us see then, to whom this befalls&mdash; whether to the rich, or to those who are not rich? Neither to the one part altogether, nor to the other, but to those who so order their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, that they may not have many grounds for sorrows. And where is such a life as this to be found? For I see you all eager and wishing to hear what this life is which has no sorrows. Well then, let this be acknowledged first by you, that this is pleasure, this the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> luxury, to have no sorrow to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> annoyance; and ask not of me meats, and wine, and sauces, and silken robes, and a sumptuous table. But if I shall show that apart from all these such a life as that is present (within our reach), then welcome thou this pleasure, and this life: for the most part of painful things happen to us from our not calculating things as we ought. Who then will have the most sorrows&mdash; he that cares for none of these things, or he that cares for them? He that fears changes, or he that does not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? He that is in dread of jealousy, of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, of false accusations, of plottings, of destruction, or he that stands aloof from these fears? He that wants many things, or he that wants nothing? He that is a slave to masters without number, or he that is a slave to none? He that has need of many things, or he that is free? He that has one lord to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, or he that fears despots innumerable? Well then, greater is the pleasure here. This then let us pursue, and not be excited about the things present: but let us laugh to scorn all the pomp of life, and everywhere practise moderation, that we may be enabled so to pass through this life, that it may be without pain, and to attain unto the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things promised, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with Whom to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> together be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, might, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and ever, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
