<h1>Homily 55 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 8:48-49</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Then answered the Jews, and said unto Him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and hast a devil? Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honor My Father.</q></div>

<p>1. A shameless and a forward  thing is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and when it ought to hide itself, then is it the fiercer. As was the case with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For when they ought to have been pricked by what was said, admiring the boldness and conclusiveness  of the words, they even insult Him, calling Him a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, and saying that He had a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and they ask, <q>Said we not well that you are a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, and hast a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>?</q> Because when He utters anything sublime, this is thought among the very senseless to be <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. Yet nowhere before did the Evangelist say that they called Him <q>a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a></q>; but from this expression it is probable that this had been often asserted by them.</p>

<p><q>You have a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> says some one. Who is it that has a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? He that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or he that insults Him that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> Him? What then says Christ, who is very meekness and gentleness? <q>I have not a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but I <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Him  that sent me.</q> Where there was need to instruct them, to pull down their excessive insolence, to teach them not to be <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> because of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, He was vehement; but when it was needful that He being insulted should bear it, He used much gentleness. When they said, <q>We have God and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> for our Father,</q> He touched them sharply; but when they called Him a <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a>, He spoke submissively, thus teaching us to avenge insults offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to overlook such as are offered to ourselves.</p>

<h2>John 8:50</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>I seek not My own glory.</q></div>

<p><q>These things,</q> He says, <q>I have spoken to show that it becomes not you, being murderers, to call God your Father; so that I have spoken them through <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> for Him, and for His sake do I hear these reproaches, and for His sake do ye dishonor Me. Yet I care not for this insolence ; to Him, for whose sake I now hear these things, you owe an account of your words. For 'I seek not My own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.' Wherefore I omit to punish you, and betake Myself to exhortation, and counsel you so to act, that you shall not only escape punishment, but also attain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q></p>

<h2>John 8:51</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death.</q></div>

<p>Here He speaks not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> only, but of a pure life. Above He said, <q>shall have everlasting life,</q> but here, <q>shall not see death.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse40">John 6:40</a></span> At the same time He hints to them that they could do nothing against Him, for if the man that should keep His saying should not die, much less should He Himself. At least they understood it so, and said to Him,</p>

<h2>John 8:52</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Now we know that you have a devil; Abraham is dead, and the Prophets are dead.</q></div>

<p>That is, <q>they who heard the word of God are dead, and shall they who have heard yours not die?</q></p>

<h2>John 8:53</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Are you greater than our father Abraham?</q></div>

<p> Alas for their vainglory! Again do they betake themselves to his relationship. Yet it would have been suitable to say, <q>Are you greater than God? Or they who have heard you than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>?</q> But they say not this, because they thought that He was even less than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. At first, therefore, He showed that they were murderers, and so led them away from the relationship; but when they persevered, He contrived this in another way, showing that they labored uselessly. And concerning the <q>death,</q> He said nothing to them, neither did He reveal or tell them what kind of death He meant, but in the meantime He would have them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that He is greater than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that even by this He may put them to shame. <q>Certainly,</q> He says, <q>were I a common man I ought not to die, having done no wrong; but when I speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, am sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and am greater than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, are you not mad, do ye not labor in vain when you attempt to kill Me?</q> What then is their reply? <q>Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you have a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> Not so spoke the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. She said not to Him, <q>You have a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></q>; but only, <q>Are you greater than our father Jacob?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse12">John 4:12</a></span> For these men were insolent and accursed, while she desired to learn; wherefore she <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> and answered with proper moderation, and called Him, <q>Lord.</q> For one who promised far greater things, and who was worthy of credit, ought not to have been insulted, but even admired; yet these men said that He had a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Those expressions of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were those of one in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; these were the words of men unbelieving and perverse. <q>Are you greater than our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>?</q> so that this (which He had said) makes Him to be greater than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. <q>When therefore you have seen Him lifted up,  you shall confess that He is greater.</q> On this account He said, <q>When you have lifted Me  up, you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I Am.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse28">John 8:28</a></span> And observe His wisdom. Having first rent them away from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> kindred, He shows that He is greater than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, that so He may be seen to be very exceedingly greater than the Prophets also. Indeed it was because they continually called Him a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> that He said, <q>My word has no place in you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse37">John 8:37</a></span> In that other place  He declared that He raises the dead, but here He says, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> shall never see death,</q> which was a much greater thing than not to allow <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> to be holden, by death. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were the more enraged. What then say they?</p>

<p><q>Whom makest you yourself?</q></p>

<p>And this too in an insulting manner. <q>You are taking somewhat upon yourself,</q> says one of them. To this then Christ replies;</p>

<h2>John 8:54</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing.</q></div>

<p>2. What say the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> here? That He heard the question, <q>Are you greater than our father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>?</q> and dared not to say to them, <q>Yea, I am greater,</q> but did so in a covert manner. What then? Is His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> <q>nothing</q>? With respect to them  it is nothing. And as He said, <q>My <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse31">John 5:31</a></span>, with reference to the opinion they would form of it, so also does He speak here.</p>

<p><q>There is One  that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> Me.</q></p>

<p>And wherefore said He not, <q>The Father that sent Me,</q> as He did before, but,</p>

<p><q>Of whom you say that He is your God.</q></p>

<h2>John 8:55</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Yet you have not known Him.</q></div>

<p>Because He desired to show that they not only knew not His Father, but that they knew not God.

<p><q>But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him.</q></p>

<p><q>So that to say, 'I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him,' is not a boast, while to say, 'I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him not,' would be a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; but you when you say that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, lie; as then ye, when you say that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, lie, so also should I, were I to say that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him not.</q></p>

<p><q>If I <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Myself.</q> Since they said, <q>Whom makest you yourself?</q> He replies, <q>If I make (Myself anything,) My <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> is nothing. As then I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him exactly, so ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him not.</q> And as in the case of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, He did not take away their whole assertion, but said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed,</q> so as to make the charge against them heavier; thus here He does not remove the whole, but what? <q>Whom ye say.</q>  By granting to them their boast of words, He increases the force of the accusation against them. How then do ye <q>not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him</q>? <q>Because ye insult One who says and does everything that He  may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, even when that One is sent from Him.</q> This assertion is unsupported by testimony, but what follows serves to establish it.</p>

<p><q>And I keep His saying.</q></p>

<p>Here they might, if at least they had anything to say, have refuted Him, for it was the strongest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His having been sent by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>John 8:56</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad.</q></div>

<p>Again, He shows that they were aliens from the race of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, if they grieved at what he rejoiced in. <q>My day,</q> seems to me to mean the day of the Crucifixion, which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> foreshowed typically by the offering of the ram and of Isaac. What do they reply?</p>

<h2>John 8:57</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>You are not yet forty  years old, and have You seen Abraham?</q></div>

<p>So that we conclude  that Christ was nearly forty.</p>

<h2>John 8:58-59</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Jesus says unto them, Before Abraham was, I Am. Then took they up stones to cast at Him.</q></div>

<p>Do you see how He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> Himself to be greater than <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>? For the man who rejoiced to see His day, and made this an object of earnest desire, plainly did so because it was a day that should be for a benefit, and belonging to one greater than himself. Because they had said, <q>The carpenter's son</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse55">Matthew 13:55</a></span>, and imagined nothing more concerning Him, He leads them by degrees to an exalted notion of Him. Therefore when they heard the words, <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> they were not grieved; but when they heard, <q>before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was, I Am,</q> as though the nobility of their descent were debased, they became <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a>, and would have <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> Him.</p>

<p><q>He saw My day, and was glad.</q> He shows, that not unwillingly He came to His Passion, since He praises him who was gladdened at the Cross. For this was the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world. But they cast stones at Him; so ready were they for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, and they did this of their own accord, without enquiry.</p>

<p>But wherefore said He not, <q>Before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was, I was,</q> instead of <q>I Am</q>? As the Father uses this expression, <q>I Am,</q> so also does Christ; for it signifies continuous Being, irrespective of all time. On which account the expression seemed to them to be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>. Now if they could not bear the comparison with <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, although this was but a trifling one, had He continually made Himself equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, would they ever have ceased casting stones at Him?</p>

<p>After this, again He flees as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and conceals Himself, having laid before them sufficient instruction: and having accomplished His work, He went forth from the Temple, and departed to heal the blind, proving by His actions that He is before <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. But perhaps some one will say, <q>Why did He not paralyze their strength?  So they would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</q> He healed the paralytic, yet they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not; nay, He wrought ten thousand wonders; at the very Passion He cast them to the ground, and darkened their eyes, yet they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not; and how would they have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> if He had paralyzed their strength? There is nothing worse than a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> hardened in desperation; though it see signs and wonders, it still perseveres in retaining the same shamelessness. Thus <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, who received ten thousand strokes, was sobered only while being punished, and continued of this character until the last day of his life, pursuing those whom he had let go. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> continually says, <q>Lest any of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse13">Hebrews 3:13</a></span> For as the callosities  of the body, when formed, become dead, and possess no sensation; so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when it is occupied by many <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, becomes dead to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and apply what you will to it, it gets no perception of the matter, but whether you threaten punishment or anything else, continues insensible.</p>

<p>3. Wherefore I beseech you, while we have hopes of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, while we can turn, to use every means to do so. For men who have become past feeling, are after that in the blind state  of despairing pilots, who give up their vessel to the wind, and themselves contribute no assistance. Thus the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> man looks to one thing only, that is, to satisfy his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and though he be like to be punished or even slain, still he is possessed solely by that passion; and in like manner the intemperate and avaricious. But if the sovereignty of the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> be so great, much greater is that of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; if for them we despise death, much more for this; if they (sinners) regard not their own lives, much less ought we to do so in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For what shall we have to say, if when they who perish are so active about their own perdition, we for our own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> manifest not even an equal activity, but ever continue wasting with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>? Nothing is worse than <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; to destroy another it destroys itself also. The eye of the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> wastes away in grief, he lives in a continual death, he deems all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, even those who have never wronged him, his enemies. He grieves that God is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, he rejoices in what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> rejoices in. Is any <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>? This is not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> him not. But is he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? Strive and be thou like him. You will not? Why then do you destroy yourself too? Why do you cast away what you have? Can you not be like him, nor gain any good thing? Why then do you besides this take for yourself <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, when you ought to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with him, that so even if you be not able to share his toils, you may profit by rejoicing with Him? For often even the will is able to effect great good. At least Ezekiel says, that the Moabites were punished because they rejoiced over the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, and that certain others were saved because they mourned over the misfortunes of their neighbors. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze025.htm#verse8">Ezekiel 25:8</a></span> Now if there be any comfort for those who mourn over the woes of others, much more for those who <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> of others. He charged the Moabites  with having exulted over the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, yet it was God that punished them; but not even when He punishes will He have us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over those that are punished. For it is not His wish to punish them. Now if we must condole with those who are punished, much more must we avoid envying those who are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. Thus, for example, Corah and Dathan perished with their company, making those whom they envied brighter, and giving themselves up to punishment. For a venomous beast is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, an unclean beast, a deliberate <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> which admits not of pardon, a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> stripped of excuse, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and mother of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.
