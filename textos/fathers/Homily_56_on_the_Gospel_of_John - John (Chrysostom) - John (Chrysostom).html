<h1>Homily 56 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 9:1-2</h2>

<p><q>And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man which was blind from his birth. And His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> asked Him, saying, Master, who did <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this man, or his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, that he was born blind?</q></p>

<p>1. <q> And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man which was blind from his birth.</q> Being full of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and caring for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and desiring to stop the mouths of the foolish, He omits nothing of His own part, though there be none to give heed. And the Prophet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this says, <q>That You might be justified when You speak, and be clear when You are judged.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse4">Psalm 51:4</a></span> Wherefore here, when they would not receive His sublime sayings, but said that He had a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and attempted to kill Him, He went forth from the Temple, and healed the blind, mitigating their rage by His absence, and by working the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> softening their hardness and cruelty, and establishing His assertions. And He works a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> which was no common one, but one which took place then for the first time. <q>Since the world began,</q> says he who was healed, <q>was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse32">John 9:32</a></span> Some have, perhaps, opened the eyes of the blind, but of one born blind never. And that on going out of the Temple, He proceeded intentionally to the work, is clear from this; it was He who saw the blind man, not the blind man who came to Him; and so earnestly did He look upon him, that even His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> perceived it. From this, at least, they came to question Him; for when they saw Him earnestly regarding the man, they asked Him, saying, <q>Who did <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this man, or his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>?</q> A mistaken question, for how could he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> before he was born? And how, if his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, would he have been punished? Whence then came they to put this question? Before, when He healed the paralytic, He said, <q>Behold, you are made whole, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse14">John 5:14</a></span> They therefore, having understood that he was palsied on account of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, said, <q>Well, that other was palsied because of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but concerning this man, what wouldest Thou say? Has he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? It is not possible to say so, for he is blind from his birth. Have his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? Neither can one say this, for the child suffers not punishment for the father.</q> As therefore when we see a child <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> entreated, we exclaim, <q>What can one say of this? What has the child done?</q> not as asking a question, but as being perplexed, so the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> spoke here, not so much asking for information, as being in perplexity. What then says Christ?</p>

<h2>John 9:3</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents.</q></div>

<p>This He says not as acquitting them of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for He says not simply, <q>Neither has this man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, nor his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>,</q> but adds, <q>that he should have been born blind  &mdash; but that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in him.</q> <q>For both this man has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but his blindness proceeds not from that.</q> And this He said, not signifying that though this man indeed was not in such case, yet that others had been made blind from such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, since it cannot be that when one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> another should be punished. For if we allow this, we must also allow that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before his birth. As therefore when He declared, <q>neither has this man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>,</q> He said not that it is possible to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from one's very birth, and be punished for it; so when He said, <q>nor his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>,</q> He said not that one may be punished for his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> sake. This supposition He re  moves by the mouth of Ezekiel; <q>As I live says the Lord, this proverb shall not be, that is used, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse3">Ezekiel 18:3</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says, <q>The father shall not die for the child, neither shall the child die for the father.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse16">Deuteronomy 24:16</a></span> And of a certain king  <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, that for this very reason he did not this thing,  observing the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>. But if any one argue, <q>How then is it said, 'Who visits the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> upon the children unto the third and fourth generation'?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy 5:9</a></span>; we should make this answer, that the assertion is not universal, but that it is spoken with reference to certain who came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And its meaning is of this kind; <q>Since these who have come out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, after signs and wonders, have become worse than their forefathers who saw none of these things, they shall suffer,</q> It says, <q>the same that those others suffered, since they have dared the same crimes.</q> And that it was spoken of those men, any one who will give attention to the passage will more certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Wherefore then was he born blind?</p>

<p><q>That the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>  of God should be made manifest,</q>  He says.</p>

<p>Lo, here again is another difficulty, if without this man's punishment, it was not possible that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God should be shown. Certainly it is not said that it was impossible, for it was possible, but, <q>that it might be manifested even in this man.</q> <q>What,</q> says some one, <q>did he suffer wrong for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God?</q> What wrong, tell me? For what if God had never willed to produce him at all? But I assert that he even received benefit from his blindness: since he recovered the sight of the eyes within. What were the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> profited by their eyes? They incurred the heavier punishment, being blinded even while they saw. And what injury had this man by his blindness? For by means of it he recovered sight. As then the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the present life are not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, so neither are the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things good; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but blindness is not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And He who had brought this man from not being into being, had also power to leave him as he was.</p>

<p>2. But some say, that this conjunction  is not at all expressive of <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, but relates to the consequence of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>; as when He says, <q>For judgment I have come into this world, that they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse39">John 9:39</a></span>; and yet it was not for this He came, that those who saw might be made blind. And again <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>Because that which may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of God is manifested in them, that they may be without excuse</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse19">Romans 1:19-20</a></span>; yet He showed it not unto them for this, that they might be deprived of excuse, but that they might obtain excuse. And again in another place, <q>The Law entered, that the offense might abound</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans 5:20</a></span>; yet it was not for this that it entered, but that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might be checked. Do you see everywhere that the conjunction relates to the consequence? For as some excellent architect may build part of a house, and leave the rest unfinished, so that to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not he may prove, by means of that remnant, that he is author of the whole; so also God joins together and completes our body, as it were a house decayed, healing the withered hand, bracing the palsied limbs, straightening the lame, cleansing the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, raising up the sick, making sound the crippled, recalling the dead from death, opening the eyes that were closed, or adding them where before they were not; all which things, being blemishes  arising from the infirmity of our nature, He by correcting showed His power.</p>

<p>But when He said, <q>That the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God might be manifested,</q> He spoke of Himself, not of the Father; His  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was already manifest. For since they had heard that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man, taking the dust of the earth, so also Christ made clay. To have said, <q>I am He who took the dust of the earth, and made man,</q> would have seemed a hard thing to His hearers; but this when shown by actual working, no longer stood in their way. So that He by taking earth, and mixing it with spittle, showed forth His hidden <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; for no small <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was it that He should be deemed the Architect of the creation.</p>

<p>And after this the rest also followed; from the part, the whole was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, since the belief of the greater also confirmed the less. For man is more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> than any created thing, and of our members the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> is the eye. This is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that He fashioned the eyes, not in a common manner, but in the way that He did. For though that member be small in size, yet it is more necessary than any part of the body. And this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> showed when he said, <q>If the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse16">1 Corinthians 12:16</a></span> For all indeed that is in us is a manifestation of the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but much more the eye; this it is that guides the whole body, this gives beauty to it all, this adorns the countenance, this is the light of all the limbs. What the sun is in the world, that the eye is in the body; quench the sun, and you destroy and confound all things; quench the  eyes, and the feet, the hands, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are useless. When these are disabled, even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is gone, since by means of these we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. <q>For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse20">Romans 1:20</a></span> Wherefore the eye is not only a light to the body, but beyond the body to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> also. On which account it is established as in a royal fortress, obtaining the higher condition, and presiding over the other senses. This then Christ forms.</p>

<p>And that you may not deem that He needs matter when He works, and that you may learn that He had not need at all of clay, (for He who brought into being the greater existences when as yet they were not, would much more have made this without matter,) that I say you may learn that He did not this through necessity, but to show that He was the Creator at the beginning, when He had spread on the clay He says, <q>Go, wash,</q> <q>that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I need not clay to create eyes, but that My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may be manifested hereby.</q> For to show that He spoke of Himself when He said, <q>That the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God may be manifested,</q> He added,</p>

<h2>John 9:4</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>I must work the works of Him that sent Me.</q></div>

<p>That is, <q>I must manifest Myself, and do the things which may show that I do the same things with the Father</q>; not things <q>similar,</q> but, <q>the same,</q> an expression which marks greater unvaryingness, and which is used of those who do not differ ever so little. Who then after this will face Him, when he sees that He has the same power with the Father? For not only did He form or open eyes, but gave also the gift of sight, which is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He also breathed in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Since if that did not work, the eye, though perfected, could never see anything; so that He gave both the energy  which is from the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and gave the member also possessing all things, both arteries and nerves and veins, and all things of which our body is composed.</p>

<p><q>I must work while it is day.</q></p>

<p>What mean these words? To what conclusion do they lead? To an important one. For what He says is of this kind. <q>While it is day, while men may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me, while this life lasts, I must work.</q></p>

<p><q>The night comes,</q> that is, futurity, <q>when no man can work.</q></p>

<p>He said not, <q>when I cannot work,</q> but, <q>when no man can work</q>: that is, when there is no longer <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor labors, nor repentance. For to show that He calls <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a <q>work,</q> when they say unto Him, <q>What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse28">John 6:28</a></span>, He replies, <q>This is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him whom He has sent.</q> How then can no man work this work in the future world?  Because there <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not, but all, willingly, or unwillingly, will submit. For lest any one should say that He acted as He did from desire of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, He shows that He did all to spare them who had power to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <q>here</q> only, but who could no longer <q>there</q> gain any good thing. On this account, though the blind man came not to Him, He did what He did: for that the man was worthy to be healed, that had he seen he would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that had he heard from any that He was present, he would not even so have been neglectful, is clear from what follows, from his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, from his very <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For it was likely that he would have considered with himself, and have said, <q>What is this? He made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, 'Go, wash;' could he not have healed me, and then have sent me to Siloam? Often have I washed there with many others, and have gained no good; had he possessed any power, he would while present have healed me.</q> Just as Naaman spoke respecting Elisha; for he too being commanded to go wash in Jordan, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not, and this too when there was such a fame abroad concerning Elisha. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ki005.htm#verse11">2 Kings 5:11</a></span> But the blind man neither disbelieved, nor contradicted, nor reasoned with himself, <q>What is this? Ought he to have put on clay? This is rather to blind one the more: who ever recovered sight so?</q> But he used no such reasonings. Do you see his steadfast <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>?</p>

<p><q>The night comes.</q> Next He shows, that even after the Crucifixion He would care for the ungodly, and bring many to Himself. For <q>it is yet day.</q> But after that, He entirely cuts them off, and declaring this, He says,</p>

<h2>John 9:5</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>As long as I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.</q></div>

<p>3. As also He said to others, <q>Believe while the light is with you.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse36">John 12:36</a></span> Wherefore then did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> call this life <q>night</q> and that other <q>day</q>? Not opposing Christ, but saying the same thing, if not in words yet in sense; for he also says, <q>The night is far spent, the day is at hand.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse12">Romans 13:12</a></span> The present time he calls <q>night,</q> because of those who sit in darkness, or because he compares it with that day which is to come, Christ calls the future <q>night,</q> because there <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has no power to work;  but <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> calls the present life night, because they are in darkness who continue in  <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and unbelief. Addressing himself then to the faithful he said, <q>The night is far spent, the day is at hand,</q> since they should enjoy that light; and he calls the old life night. <q>Let us put away,</q> he says, <q>the works of darkness.</q> Do you see that he tells them that it is <q>night</q>? Wherefore he says, <q>Let us walk honestly as in the day,</q> that we may enjoy that light. For if this light be so good, consider what that will be; as much as the sunlight is brighter than the flame of a candle, so much and far more is that light better than this. And signifying this, Christ says, that <q>the sun shall be darkened.</q> Because of the excess of that brightness, not even the sun shall be seen.</p>

<p>If now in order to have here well-lighted and airy houses, we expend immense sums, building and toiling, consider how we ought to spend our very bodies themselves, that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> houses may be built for us in the heavens where is that Light ineffable. Here there are strifes and contentions about boundaries and walls, but there will be nothing of the kind there, no <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, no one will dispute with us about settling boundaries. This dwelling too we assuredly needs must leave, but that abides with us forever; this must decay by time, and be exposed to innumerable injuries, but that must remain without growing old perpetually; this a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man cannot build, but that other one may build with two mites, as did the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. Wherefore I choke with grief, that when so many blessings are laid before us, we are <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, and despise them; we use every exertion to have splendid houses here, but how to gain in heaven so much as a little resting-place, we care not, we think not. For tell me, where would you have your dwelling here? In the wilderness, or in one of the smaller cities? I think not; but in some of the most royal and grand cities, where the traffic is more, where the splendor is greater. But I will lead you into such a City, whose Builder and Maker is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; there I exhort you to found and build, at less cost [with less labor ]. That house the hands of the poor build, and it is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <q>building,</q> just as the structures made here are the work of extreme folly. For if a man were to bring you into the land of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, to behold what is there and to return, and were then to bid you build houses there, would you not condemn him for excessive folly, as bidding you spend unseasonably? How then do you this very same thing upon the earth which you shall shortly leave? <q>But I shall leave it to my children,</q> says some one. Yet they too shall leave it soon after you; nay, often even before you; and their successors the same. And even here it is a subject of melancholy to you that you see not your heirs retain their possessions, but there you need apprehend nothing of the sort; the possession remains immovable, to you, to your children, and to their descendants, if they imitate the same goodness. That building Christ takes in hand, he who builds that needs not to appoint care-takers, nor be thoughtful, nor anxious; for when God has undertaken the work, what need of thought? He brings all things together, and raises the house. Nor is this the only thing wonderful, but also that He so builds it as is pleasing to you, or rather even beyond what is pleasing, beyond what you desire, for He is the most excellent Artist, and cares greatly for your advantage. If you are poor, and desirest to build this house, it brings you no <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, produces against you no <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, for none of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> behold it, but the Angels who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at your blessings; none will be able to encroach upon it, for none dwell near it of those who are diseased with such <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. For neighbors you have there the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> with their company, all the Prophets, the Martyrs, the multitude  of Angels, of Archangels. For the sake then of all these things,  let us empty our substance upon the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, that we may obtain those tabernacles;  which may we all obtain through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom and with whom to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, now and ever and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
