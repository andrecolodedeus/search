<h1>Homily 57 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 9:6-7</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>When Jesus had thus spoken, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and He anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, and said, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.</q></div>

<p>1. Those who intend to gain any advantage from what they read, must not pass by even any small portion of the words; and on this account we are bidden to <q>search</q> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, because most of the words, although at first sight  easy, appear to have in their depth much hidden meaning. For observe of what sort is the present case. <q>Having said these words,</q> It says,<q> He spat on the ground.</q> What words? <q>That the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God should be made manifest,</q> and that, <q>I must work the works of Him that sent Me.</q> For not without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> has the Evangelist mentioned to us His words, and added that, <q>He spat,</q> but to show that He confirmed His words by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. And why used He not water instead of spittle for the clay? He was about to send the man to Siloam: in order therefore that nothing might be ascribed to the fountain, but that you might learn that the power proceeding from His mouth, the same both formed and opened the man's eyes, He <q>spat on the ground</q>; this at least the Evangelist signified, when he said, <q>And made clay of the spittle.</q> Then, that the successful issue might not seem to be of the earth, He bade him wash. But wherefore did He not this at once, instead of sending him to Siloam? That you may learn the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the blind man, and that the obstinacy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> might be silenced: for it was probable that they would all see him as he departed, having the clay spread upon his eyes, since by the strangeness of the thing he would attract to himself all, both those who did and those who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him, and they would observe him exactly. And because it is not easy to recognize a blind man who has recovered sight, He first makes by the length of way many to be witnesses, and by the strangeness of the spectacle exact observers, that being more attentive they may no longer be able to say, <q>It is he: it is not he.</q> Moreover, by sending him to Siloam, He desires to prove that He is not estranged from the Law and the Old (Covenant), nor could it afterwards be feared that Siloam would receive the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, since many who had often washed their eyes there gained no such benefit; for there also it was the power of Christ that wrought all. On which account the Evangelist adds for us the interpretation of the name; for having said, <q>in Siloam,</q> he adds,</p>

<p><q>Which is,  Sent.</q></p>

<p>That you may learn that there also it was Christ who healed him. As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>They drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1 Corinthians 10:4</a></span> As then Christ was the spiritual Rock, so also was He the spiritual Siloam. To me also the sudden  coming in of the water seems to hint an ineffable <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. What is that? The unlooked for (nature) of His appearance, beyond all expectation.</p>

<p>But observe the mind of the blind man, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> in everything. He said not, <q>If it is really the clay or the spittle which gives me eyes, what need of Siloam? Or if there be need of Siloam, what need of the clay? Why did he anoint me? Why bid me wash?</q> But he entertained no such thoughts, he held himself prepared for one thing only, to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> in all things Him who gave the command, and nothing that was done offended him. If any one ask, <q>How then did he recover his sight, when he had removed the clay?</q> he will hear no other answer from us than that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the manner. And what wonder if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not, since not even the Evangelist <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, nor the very man that was healed? What had been done he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, but the manner of doing it he could not comprehend. So when he was asked he said, that <q>He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see</q>; but how this took place he cannot tell them, though they ask ten thousand times.</p>

<h2>John 9:8-9</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>The neighbors therefore, and they which  had seen him, that he was a beggar,  said, Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said, This is he.</q></div>
<p>The strangeness of what had been brought to pass led them even to unbelief, though so much had been contrived  that they might not disbelieve. They said, <q>Is not this he that sat and begged?</q> O the lovingkindness of God! Whither did He descend, when with great kindness He healed even beggars, and so silenced the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, because He deemed not the illustrious, nor the distinguished, nor the rulers, but men  of no mark to be fit objects of the same Providence. For He came for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all.</p>

<p>And what happened in the case of the paralytic, happened also with this man, for neither did the one or the other <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who it was that healed him. And this was caused by the retirement of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for Jesus when He healed always retired, that all suspicion might be removed from the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Since how could they who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not who He was flatter Him, or join in contriving what had been done? Neither was this man one of those who went about, but of those who sat at the doors of the Temple. Now when all were doubting concerning him, what says he?</p>

<p><q>I am he.</q></p>

<p>He was not ashamed of his former blindness, nor did he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the people, nor did he decline showing himself that he might proclaim his Benefactor.</p>

<h2>John 9:10-11</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>They said unto him, How were your eyes opened? He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus.</q></div>

<p>What do you say? Does <q>a man</q> work such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>? As yet he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing great concerning Him.</p>

<p><q>A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes.</q></p>

<p>2. Observe how truthful he is. He says not whence He made it, for he speaks not of what he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; he saw not that He spat on the ground, but that He spread it on he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> from sense and touch.</p>

<p><q>And said unto me, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.</q></p>

<p>This too his hearing witnessed to him. But how did he recognize His voice? From His conversation with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. And saying all this, and having received the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> by the works, the manner (of the cure) he cannot tell. &nbsp;Now if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is needed in matters which are felt and handled, much more in the case of things invisible.</p>

<h2>John 9:12</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>They said unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</q></div>

<p>They said, <q>Where is he?</q> having already murderous intentions against Him. But observe the modesty  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, how He continued not with those who were healed; because He neither desired to reap <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nor to draw a multitude, nor to make a show of Himself. Observe too how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a> the blind man makes all his answers. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> desired to find Christ to bring Him to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, but when they did not find Him, they brought the blind man to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, as to those who would question him more severely. For which reason the Evangelist remarks, that it was <q>the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse14">John 9:14</a></span>, in order to point out their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thoughts, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which they sought Him, as though forsooth they had found a handle, and could disparage the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> by means of what appeared to be a transgression of the Law. And this is clear from their saying immediately on seeing him nothing but, <q>How opened he your eyes?</q>  Observe also the manner of their speech; they say not, <q>How did you receive your sight?</q> but, <q>How opened he your eyes?</q> thus affording him an excuse for <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandering</a> Jesus, because of His having worked. But he speaks to them shortly, as to men who had already heard; for without mentioning His name, or that <q>He said unto me, Go, wash,</q> he at once says,</p>

<h2>John 9:15</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and do see.</q></div>

<p>Because the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> was now become great, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had said, <q>Behold what work Jesus does on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>, he anoints with clay!</q> But observe, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, how the blind man is not disturbed. When being questioned he spoke in the presence of those others without danger, it was no such great thing to tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but the wonder is, that now when he is placed in a situation of greater <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he neither denies nor contradicts what he had said before. What then did the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, or rather what did the others also? They had brought him (to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>), as being about to deny; but, on the contrary, that befell them which they desired not, and they learned more exactly. And this they everywhere have to endure, in the case of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; but this point we will more clearly demonstrate in what follows. What said the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>?</p>

<h2>John 9:16</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Some said,</q> (not all, but the more forward,) <q>This man is not of God, because he keeps not the Sabbath day; others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?</q></div>

<p>Do you see that they were led up  by the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? For hear what they say now, who before this had sent to bring Him. And if all did not so, (for being rulers through vainglory they fell into unbelief,) yet still the greater number even of the rulers <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, but confessed Him not. Now the multitude was easily overlooked, as being of no great account in their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, but the rulers being more conspicuous had the greater difficulty in speaking boldly, or some the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of rule restrained, others cowardice, and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the many. Wherefore also He said, <q>How can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> who receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from men?</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse44">John 5:44</a></span> And these who were seeking to kill Him <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> said that they  were of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that He who healed the blind could not be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He kept not the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>; to which the others objected, that a sinner could not do such <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Those first maliciously keeping silence about what had taken place, brought forward the seeming transgression; for they said not, <q>He heals on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a>,</q> but, <q>He keeps not the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>.</q> These, on the other hand, replied weakly, for when they ought to have shown that the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> was not broken, they rely only upon the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>; and with reason, for they still thought that He was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. If this had not been the case, they might besides have urged in His defense, that He was Lord of the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> which Himself had made, but as yet they had not this opinion. Anyhow, none of them dared to say what he wished openly, or in the way of an assertion, but only in the way of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, some from not having boldness of speech, others through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of rule.</p>

<p><q>There was therefore a division among them.</q> This division first began among the people, then later among the rulers also, and some said, <q>He is a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man</q>; others, <q>Nay, but he deceives the people.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse12">John 7:12</a></span> Do you see that the rulers were more void of understanding than the many, since they were divided later than they? And after they were divided, they did not exhibit any noble feeling, when they saw the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> pressing upon them. Since had they been entirely separated from them, they would soon have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For it is possible to do well in separating. Wherefore also Himself has said, <q>I have come not to bring peace upon the earth but a sword.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew 10:34</a></span> For there is an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concord, and there is a good disagreement. Thus they who built the tower <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse4">Genesis 11:4</a></span>, agreed together to their own hurt; and these same again were separated, though unwillingly, yet for their good. Thus also Corah and his company agreed together for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, therefore they were separated for good; and Judas agreed with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. So division may be good, and agreement may be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Wherefore It says, <q>If your eye offend you, smite it out,  if your foot, cut it off.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse29">Matthew 5:29</a>, and <a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse8">18:8</a></span> Now if we must separate ourselves from an ill-joined limb, must we not much more from friends united to us for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ? So that agreement is not in all cases a good, just as division is not in all cases an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>3. These things I say, that we may shun <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, and follow the good; for if in the case of our limbs we cut off that which is rotten and incurable, fearing lest the rest of the body should catch the same disease, and if we do this not as having no care for that part, but rather as desiring to preserve the remainder, how much more must we do this in the case of those who consent with us for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? If we can set them right without receiving injury ourselves, we ought to use every means to do so; but if they remain incorrigible and may injure us, it is necessary to cut them off and cast them away. For so they will often be  gainers rather (than losers). Wherefore also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> exhorted, saying, <q>And you shall put away from among yourselves that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> person</q>; and, <q>that he that has done this deed may be put away from among you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 5:13</a></span> A dreadful thing, dreadful indeed, is the society of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men; not so quickly does the pestilence seize or the itch infect those that come in contact with such as are under the disease, as does the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men. For <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications corrupt good manners.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1 Corinthians 15:33</a></span> And again the Prophet says, <q>Come out from among them, and be ye separate.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse11">Isaiah 52:11</a></span> Let no one then have a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man for his friend. For if when we have bad sons we publicly disclaim them, without regarding nature or its <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, or the constraint which it lays upon us, much more ought we to fly from our companions and acquaintances when they are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Because even if we receive no injury from them, we shall anyhow not be able to escape ill report, for strangers search not into our lives, but judge us from our companions. This advice I address to young men and maidens. <q>Providing,</q>  It says, <q>things honest,</q> not only in the sight of the Lord, but also <q>in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse17">Romans 12:17</a></span> Let us then use every means that our neighbor be not offended. For a life, though it be very upright, if it offend others has lost all. But how is it possible for the life that is upright to offend? When the society of those that are not upright invests it with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>; for when, trusting in ourselves, we consort with bad men, even though we be not harmed, we offend others. These things I say to men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and maidens, leaving it to their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> to see exactly how many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are produced from this source. Neither I, perhaps, nor any of the more perfect, suspect any ill; but the simpler brother is harmed by occasion of your perfection; and you ought to be careful also for his infirmity. And even if he receive no injury, yet the Greek is harmed. Now <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bids us be <q>without offense, both to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse32">1 Corinthians 10:32</a></span> (I think no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the virgin, for I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> thinks no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1 Corinthians 13:5</a></span>; I am a great admirer of that state of life,  and I cannot have so much as an unseemly thought about it.) How shall we per  suade those that are without? For we must take forethought for them also. Let us then so order what relates to ourselves, that none of the unbelievers may be able even to find a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> handle of accusation against us. For as they who show forth a right life glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so they who do the contrary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Him to be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>. May no such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be among  us: but may our works so shine, that our Father which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and that we may enjoy the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which is from Him. To which may we all attain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
