<h1>Homily 5 on Philippians</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse1">Philippians 2:1-4</a></span> </p>

<p><q>If there is therefore any comfort in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if any consolation of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if any fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if any tender mercies and compassions, fulfil ye my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that you be of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, having the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, being of one accord, of one mind; doing nothing through faction or through vainglory; but in lowliness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, each counting other better than himself; not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</q></p>

<p>There is nothing better, there is nothing more affectionate, than a spiritual teacher; such an one surpasses the kindness of any natural father. Do but consider, how this blessed one entreats the Philippians concerning the things which were to their own advantage. What says he, in exhorting them concerning concord, that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things? See how earnestly, how vehemently, with how much sympathy he speaks, <q>If there be therefore any comfort in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> that is, if you have any comfort in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as if he had said, If you make any account of me, if you have any care of me, if you have ever received good at my hands, do this. This mode of earnestness we use when we claim a matter which we prefer to everything else. For if we did not prefer it to everything, we should not wish to receive in it our recompense for all things, nor say that through it all is represented. We indeed remind men of our carnal claims; for example, if a father were to say, If you have any reverence for your father, if any remembrance of my care in nourishing you, if any affection towards me, if any memory of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> you have received of me, if any of my kindness, be not at enmity with your brother; that is, for all those things, this is what I ask in return.</p>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> does not so; he calls to our remembrance no carnal, but all of them spiritual benefits. That is, if you wish to give me any comfort in my <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, and encouragement in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if any consolation of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if you wish to show any communion in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if you have any tender mercies and compassions, fulfil ye my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. <q>If any tender mercies and compassions.</q> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaks of the concord of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as compassion towards himself, thus showing that the danger was extreme, if they were not of one mind. If I can obtain comfort from you, if I can obtain any consolation from our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if I can communicate with you in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if I can have fellowship with you in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, if I can find mercy and compassion at your hands, show by your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the return of all this. All this have I gained, if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse2">Ver. 2</a>. <q>Fulfil ye my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q></p>

<p>That the exhortation might not seem to be made to people who were still deficient, see how he says not, <q>do me <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>,</q> but <q>fulfil my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a></q>; that is, You have begun to plant it in me, you have already given me some portion of peacefulness, but I desire to arrive at its fullness? Say, what would you? That we deliver you from dangers? That we supply somewhat to your need? Not so, but <q>that you be of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, having the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> in which you have begun, <q>being of one accord, of one mind.</q> Just see, how often he repeats the same thing by reason of his great affection! <q>That ye be of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> or rather, <q>that you be of one mind.</q> For this is more than <q>the same.</q></p>

<p><q>Having the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> That is, let it not be simply about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, but also in all other things; for there is such a thing as to be of the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and yet not to have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <q>Having the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> that is, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and be loved alike; do not thou enjoy much <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and show less <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so as to be <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> even in this matter; but do not suffer it in yourself. <q>Of one accord,</q> he adds, that is, appropriating with one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the bodies of all, not in substance, for that is impossible, but in purpose and intention. Let all things proceed as from one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. What means <q>of one accord</q>? He shows when he says <q>of one mind.</q> Let your mind be one, as if from one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse3">Ver. 3</a>. <q>Doing nothing through faction.</q></p>

<p>He finally demands this of them, and tells  them the way how this may be. <q>Doing nothing through faction or vainglory.</q> This, as I always say, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Hence come fightings and contentions. Hence come envyings and strifes. Hence it is that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> waxes cold, when we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the praise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, when we are slaves to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which is paid by the many, for it is not possible for a man to be the slave of praise, and also a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. How then shall we flee vainglory? For you have not yet told us the way. Listen then to what follows.</p>

<p><q>But in lowliness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, each counting other better than himself.</q> Oh how full of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, how universal a gathering-word  of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is the lesson he has put forth! If you deem, he means, that another is greater than yourself, and persuadest yourself so, yea more, if you not only sayest it, but art fully assured of it, then you assign him the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and if you assign him the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, you will not be displeased at seeing him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by another. Do not then think him simply greater than yourself, but <q>better,</q> which is a very great superiority, and thou dost not think it strange nor be pained thereby, if you see him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. Yea, though he treat you with scorn, thou dost bear it nobly, for you have esteemed him greater than yourself. Though he revile you, thou dost submit. Though he treat you ill, you bear it in silence. For when once the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is fully assured that he is greater, it falls not into <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> when it is ill-treated by him, nor yet into <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, for no one would <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> those who are very far above himself, for all things belong to his superiority.</p>

<p>Here then he instructs the one party to be thus minded. But when he too, who enjoys such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from you, is thus affected toward you, consider what a double wall there is erected of gentle forbearance [comp. <a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse5">Philip. iv. 5</a>.]; for when you esteem him thus worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and he you likewise, no painful thing can possibly arise; for if this conduct when shown by one is sufficient to destroy all strife, who shall break down the safeguard, when it is shown by both? Not even the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> himself. The defense is threefold, and fourfold, yea manifold, for humanity is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all good; and that you may learn this, listen to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>Had you desired <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, I would have given it: You will not delight in burnt offerings. The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for God is a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart God will not despise.</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa051.htm#verse16">Psalm 51:16-17</a></span> Not simply humility, but intense humility. As in the case of bodily substances, that which is <q>broken</q> will not rise against that which is <q>solid,</q> but, how many ills soever it may suffer, will perish itself rather than attack the other, so too the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, even if constantly suffering ill, will choose rather to die, than to avenge itself by attack.</p>

<p>How long shall we be puffed up thus ridiculously? For as we laugh, when we see children drawing themselves up, and looking <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>, or when we see them picking up stones and throwing them, thus too the haughtiness  of men belongs to a puerile <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and an unformed mind. <q>Why are earth and ashes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse9">Sirach 10:9</a></span> Are you highminded, O man? And why? Tell me what is the gain? Whence are you highminded against those of your own kind? Do you not share the same nature? The same life? Have you not received like <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from God? But you are wise? You ought to be thankful, not to be puffed up. Haughtiness is the first act of ingratitude, for it denies  the gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. He that is puffed up, is puffed up as if he had excelled by his own strength, and he who thinks he has thus excelled is ungrateful toward Him who bestowed that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Have you any good? Be thankful to Him who gave it. Listen to what Joseph said, and what Daniel. For when the king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> sent for him, and in the presence of all his host asked him concerning that matter in which the Egyptians, who were most learned in these things, had forsaken the field, when he was on the point of carrying off everything from them, and of appearing wiser than the astrologers, the enchanters, the magicians, and all the wise men of those times, and that from captivity and servitude, and he but a youth (and his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> was thus greater, for it is not the same thing to shine when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and contrary to expectation, so that its being unlooked for rendered him the more admirable); what then, when he came before <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>? Was it <q>Yea, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></q>? But what? When no one urged it on him, he said from his own excellent spirit, <q>Do not interpretations belong to God?</q>  Behold he straightway <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> his Master, therefore he was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. And this also is no small thing. For that God had revealed it to him was a far greater thing than if he had himself excelled. For he showed that his words were worthy of credit, and it was a very great <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his intimacy with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. There is no one thing so good as to be the intimate friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For if,</q> says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, <q>he [<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>] was justified by works, he has whereof to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but not toward God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse2">Romans 4:2</a></span> For if he who has been vouchsafed <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> makes his boast in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he is loved of Him, because his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven, he too that works has whereof to boast, but not before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the other (for it  is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of our excessive weakness); he who has received wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how much more admirable is he? He glorifies God and is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> of Him, for He says, <q>Them that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Me, I will <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse30">1 Samuel 2:30</a></span></p>

<p>Again, listen to him who descended from Joseph, than whom no one was wiser. <q>Are you wiser,</q>  says he, <q>than Daniel?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse3">Ezekiel 28:3</a></span> This Daniel then, when all the wise men that were in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and the astrologers moreover, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the magicians, the enchanters,  yea when the whole of their wisdom was not only coming to be convicted, but to be wholly destroyed (for their being destroyed was a clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that they had deceived before), this Daniel coming forward, and preparing to solve the king's question, does not take the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to himself, but first ascribes the whole to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and says, <q>But as for me, O king, it is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have beyond all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse30">Daniel 2:30</a></span> And <q>the king worshipped him, and commanded that they should offer an oblation.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse46">Daniel 2:46</a></span> Do you see his humility? Do you see his excellent spirit? Do you see this habit of lowliness? Listen also to the Apostles, saying at one time, "Why fasten ye your eyes on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man to walk? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse12">Acts 3:12</a></span> And again, <q>We are men of like <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> with you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act014.htm#verse15">Acts 14:15</a></span> Now if they thus refused the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> paid them, men who by reason of the humility and power of Christ wrought greater <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> than Christ (for He says, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me shall do greater works than those that I do</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse12">John 14:12</a>, abr</span>), shall not we wretched and miserable men do so, who cannot even beat away gnats,  much less devils? Who have not power to benefit a single man, much less the whole world, and yet think so much of ourselves that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> himself is not like us?</p>

<p>There is nothing so foreign to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as haughtiness. Haughtiness, I say, not boldness nor <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, for these are congenial. But these are one thing, and that another; so too humility is one thing, and meanness, flattery, and adulation another.</p>

<p>I will now, if you wish, give you examples of all these qualities. For these things which are contraries, seem in some way to be placed near together, as the tares to the wheat, and the thorns to the rose. But while babes might easily be deceived, they who are men in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and are skilled in spiritual husbandry, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to separate what is really good from the bad. Let me then lay before you examples of these qualities from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. What is flattery, and meanness, and adulation? Ziba flattered  David out of season, and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> his master. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2sa016.htm#verse1">2 Samuel 16:1-3</a></span> Much more did Ahitophel flatter Absalom. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2sa017.htm#verse1">2 Samuel 17:1-4</a></span> But David was not so, but he was <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>. For the deceitful are flatterers, as when they say, <q>O king, live for ever.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse4">Daniel 2:4</a></span> Again, what flatterers the magicians are.</p>

<p>We shall find much to exemplify this in the case of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the Acts. When he disputed with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> he did not flatter them, but was humble-minded (for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to speak boldly), as when he says, <q>I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse17">Acts 28:17</a></span></p>

<p>That these were the words of humility, listen how he rebukes them in what follows, <q>Well spoke the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, By hearing you shall hear, and shall in nowise understand, and seeing you shall see, and in nowise perceive.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse25">Acts 28:25</a></span></p>

<p>Do you see his <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>? Behold also the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of John the Baptist, which he used before <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>; when he said, <q>It is not lawful for you to have your brother Philip's wife.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar006.htm#verse18">Mark 6:18</a></span> This was boldness, this was <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. Not so the words of Shimei, when he said, <q>Begone, thou man of blood</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2sa016.htm#verse7">2 Samuel 16:7</a></span>, and yet he too spoke with boldness; but this is not <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, but audacity, and insolence, and an unbridled tongue. <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> too reproached Jehu, when she said, <q>The slayer of his master</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ki009.htm#verse31">2 Kings 9:31</a></span>, but this was audacity, not boldness. Elias too reproached, but this was boldness and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>; <q>I do not trouble <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but you and your father's house.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse18">1 Kings 18:18</a></span> Again, Elias spoke with boldness to the whole people, saying, <q>How long will you go lame on both your thighs?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse21">1 Kings 18:21</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> Thus to rebuke was boldness and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. This too the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> did, but that other was audacity.</p>

<p>Would you see words both of humility and not of flattery,  listen to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, saying, <q>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> judgment; yea, I judge not my own self. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing against myself, yet am I not hereby justified.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse3">1 Corinthians 4:3-4</a></span> This is of a spirit that becomes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; and again, <q>Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a></q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 6:1</a></span></p>

<p>Would you see the flattery of the foolish <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Listen to them, saying, <q>We have no king but C&aelig;sar.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse15">John 19:15</a></span> Would you see humility? Listen to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> again, when he says, <q>For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse5">2 Corinthians 4:5</a></span> Would you see both flattery and audacity? <q>Audacity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa025.htm#verse10">1 Samuel 25:10</a></span> in the case of Nabal, and <q>flattery</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa023.htm#verse20">1 Samuel 23:20</a></span> in that of the Ziphites? For in their purpose they betrayed David. Would you see <q>wisdom</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa026.htm#verse5">1 Samuel 26:5-12</a></span> and not flattery, that of David, how he gat Saul into his power, and yet spared him? Would you see the flattery of those who murdered Mephibosheth,  whom also David slew? In fine, and as it were in outline, to sum up all, audacity is shown when one is enraged, and insults another for no just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, either to avenge himself, or in some <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> way is audacious; but boldness and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> are when we dare to face perils and deaths, and despise friendships and enmities for the sake of what is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Again, flattery and meanness are when one courts another not for any right end, but hunting after some of the things of this life; but humility, when one does this for the sake of things pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and descends from his own proper station that he may perform something great and admirable. If we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> are we if we do them. For to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them is not enough. For <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Not the hearers of a law, but the doers of a law shall be justified.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse13">Romans 2:13</a></span> Yea, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> itself condemns, when it is without action and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore that we may escape the condemnation, let us follow after the practice, that we may obtain those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that are promised to us, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>
