<h1>Homily 5 on the First Epistle of John</h1>

<h2>1 John 3:9-18</h2>

<p><q>Whosoever is born of God does not commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: whosoever is not righteous is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither he that loves not his brother. For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another. Not as Cain, who was of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and his brother's righteous. Marvel not, my brethren, if the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have passed from death unto life, because we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brethren. He that loves not abides in death. Whosoever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer: and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that no murderer has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life abiding in him. In this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that He laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoso has this world's good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how can the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God dwell in him? My little children, let us not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> only in word and in tongue; but in deed and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<p>1. Hear intently, I do beseech you, because it is no small matter that we have to cope withal: and I <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not, because you were intent upon it yesterday, that you have with even greater intentness of purpose come together today. For it is no slight question, how he says in this Epistle, <q>Whosoever is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172237"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:9</a></span> and how in the same Epistle he has said above, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172238"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> What shall the man do, who is pressed by both sayings out of the same Epistle? If he shall confess himself a sinner, he fears lest it be said to him, Then are you not born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because it is written, <q>Whosoever is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not.</q> But if he shall say that he is just and that he has no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he receives on the other side a blow from the same Epistle, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> Placed then as he is in the midst, what he can say and what confess, or what profess, he cannot find. To profess himself to be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is full of peril; and not only full of peril, but also full of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: <q>We deceive ourselves,</q> says he, <q>and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us, if we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> But oh that you had none, and said this! For then would you say <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, and in uttering the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> would have not so much as a vestige of wrong to be afraid of. But, that you do ill if you say so, is because it is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> that you say, <q>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> says he, <q>is not in us, if we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> He says not, <q>Have not had;</q> lest haply it should seem to be spoken of the past life. For the man here has had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: but from the time that he was born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he has begun not to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. If it were so, there would be no question to embarrass us. For we should say, We have been sinners, but now we are justified: we have had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but now we have none. He says not this: but what says he? <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> And then after a while he says on the other hand, <q>Whosoever is born of God <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not.</q> Was John himself not born of God? If John was not born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, John, of whom you have heard that he lay in the Lord's bosom; does any man dare engage for himself that in him has taken place that regeneration which it was not granted to that man to have, to whom it was granted to lie in the bosom of the Lord? The man whom the Lord loved more than the rest, <span class="stiki" id="note172239"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;13:23</a></span> him alone had He not begotten of the Spirit?</p>

<p>2. Mark now these words. As yet, I am urging it upon you, what straits we are put to that by putting your minds on the stretch, that is, by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for us and for yourselves, God may make enlargement, and give us an outlet: lest some man find in His word an occasion of his own perdition, that word which was preached and put in writing only for healing and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. <q>Every man,</q> says he, <q>that does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, does also iniquity.</q> Lest haply you make a distinction, <q>Sin is iniquity.</q> Lest you say, A sinner I am, but not a doer of iniquity, <q>Sin is iniquity. And ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that to this end was He manifested, that He should take away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in Him.</q> And what does it profit us, that He came without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? <q>Every one that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not, abides in Him: and every one that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, has not seen Him, neither <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him. Little children, let no man seduce you. He that does righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous.</q> This we have already said, that the word <q>as</q> is wont to be used of a certain resemblance, not of equality. <q>He that does <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from the beginning.</q> This too we have already said, that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> created no man, nor begot any, but his imitators are, as it were, born of him. <q>To this end was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> manifested, that He should undo  the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> Consequently, to undo (or loose) <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He that has no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And then follows: <q>Every one that is born of God does not commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he is born of God:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172241"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:9</a></span> he has drawn the cord tight!&mdash; Belike, it is in regard of some one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that he has said, <q>Does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> not in regard of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: that in this that he says, <q>Whoso is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> you may understand some one particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which that man who is born of God cannot commit:  and such is that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that, if one commit it, it confirms the rest. What is this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? To do contrary to the commandment. What is the commandment? <q>A new commandment give I unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172243"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34</a></span> Mark well! This commandment of Christ is called, <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> By this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are loosed. If this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> be not kept, the not holding it is at once a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the root of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>3. Mark well, brethren; we have brought forward somewhat in which, to them that have good understanding, the question is solved. But do we only walk in the way with them that run more swiftly? Those that walk more slowly must not be left behind. Let us turn the matter every way, in such words as we can, in order that it may be brought within reach of all. For I suppose, brethren, that every man is concerned for his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, who does not come to Church without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, who does not seek temporal things in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who does not come here to transact secular business; but comes here in order that he may lay hold upon some <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> thing, promised unto him, whereunto he may attain: he must needs consider how he shall walk in the way, lest he be left behind, lest he go back, lest he go astray, lest by halting he do not attain. Whoever therefore is in earnest, let him be slow, let him be swift, yet let him not leave the way. This then I have said, that in saying, <q>Whosoever is born of God <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not,</q> it is probable he meant it of some particular <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for else it will be contrary to that place: <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> In this way then the question may be solved. There is a certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which he that is born of God cannot commit; a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which not being committed, other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are loosed, and being committed, other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are confirmed. What is this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? To do contrary to the commandment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, contrary to the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>.  What is the new commandment? <q>A new commandment give I unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172245"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34</a></span> Whoso does contrary to charity and contrary to brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, let him not dare to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and say that he is born of God: but whoso is in brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, there are certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which he cannot commit, and this above all, that he should <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> his brother. And how fares it with him concerning his other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, of which it is said, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us?</q> Let him hear that which shall set his mind at rest from another place of Scripture; <q>Charity covers a multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172246"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Charity therefore we commend; charity this Epistle commends. The Lord, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, what question put He to Peter, but, <q>Do you love me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172247"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;21:15-17</a></span> And it was not enough to ask it once; a second time also He put none other question, a third time also none other. Although when it came to the third time, Peter, as one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what was the drift of this, was grieved because it seemed as if the Lord did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him; nevertheless both a first time and a second, and a third He put this question. Thrice <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> denied, thrice <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> confessed. Behold Peter loves the Lord. What is he to do for the Lord? For think not that he in the Psalm did not feel himself at a loss what to do: <q>What shall I render unto the Lord for all the benefits He has done unto me?</q>  He that said this in the Psalm, marked what great things had been done for him by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and sought what he should render to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and could find nothing. For whatever you would render, from Him did you receive it to render. And what did he find to offer in return? That which, as we said, my brethren, he had received from Him, that only found he to offer in return. <q>I will receive the cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and will call upon the name of the Lord.</q> For who had given him the cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but He to whom he wished to offer in return? Now to receive the cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and call upon the name of the Lord, is to be filled with charity; and so filled, that not only you shall not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> your brother, but shall be prepared to die for your brother. This is perfect charity, that you be prepared to die for your brother. This the Lord exhibited in Himself, who died for all, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for them by whom He was crucified, and saying, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172249"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> But if He alone has done this, He was not a Master, if He had no <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Disciples who came after Him have done this.  Men were <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a> Stephen, and he knelt down and said, <q>Lord, lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172251"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse59">Acts&nbsp;7:59</a></span> He loved them that were killing him; since for them also he was dying. Hear also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>: <q>And I myself,</q> says he, <q>will be spent for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172252"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:15</a></span> For he was among those for whom Stephen, when by their hands he was dying, besought forgiveness. This then is perfect charity. If any man shall have so great charity that he is prepared even to die for his brethren, in that man is perfect charity. But as soon as it is born, is it already quite perfect? That it may be made perfect, it is born; when born, it is nourished; when nourished, it is strengthened; when strengthened, it is perfected; when it has come to perfection, what says it? <q>To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. I wished to be dissolved, and to be with Christ; which is far better: nevertheless to abide in the flesh is needful for you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172253"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;1:21-24</a></span> For their sakes he was willing to live, for whose sakes he was prepared to die.</p>

<p>5. And that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is this perfect charity which that man violates not, and against which that man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not, who is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; this is what the Lord says to Peter; <q>Peter do you love me?</q> And he answers, <q>I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> He says not, If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me, show kindness to me. For when the Lord was in mortal flesh, He hungered, He thirsted: at that time when He hungered and thirsted, He was taken in as a guest; those who had the means, ministered unto Him of their substance, as we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Zacch&aelig;us entertained Him as his guest: he was saved from his disease by entertaining the Physician. From what disease? The disease of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. For he was very rich, and the chief of the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>. Mark the man made whole from the disease of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>: <q>The half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man, I will restore him fourfold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172254"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;19:8</a></span> That he kept the other half, was not to enjoy it, but to pay his debts. Well, he at that time entertained the Physician as his guest, because there was infirmity of the flesh in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, to which men might show this kindness; and this, because it was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to grant this very thing to them that did Him kind service; for the benefit was to them that did the service, not to Him. For, could He to whom <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> ministered require these men's kindness? Not even His servant Elias, to whom He sent bread and flesh by the ravens upon a certain occasion <span class="stiki" id="note172255"><a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;17:4-9</a></span> had need of this; and yet that a religious <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> might be blessed, the servant of God is sent, and he whom God in secret did feed, is fed by the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. But still, although by the means of these servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, those who consider their need get good to themselves, in respect of that reward most manifestly set forth by the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>He that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward: and he that receives a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> in the name of a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> shall receive a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> reward: and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, verily I say unto you, He shall in no wise lose his reward:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172256"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;10:41-42</a></span> although, then, they that do this, do it to their own good: yet neither could this kind office be done to Him when about to ascend  into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. What could Peter, who loved Him, render unto Him? Hear what. <q>Feed my sheep:</q> <em>i.e.</em> do for the brethren, that which I have done for you. I redeemed all with my blood: hesitate not to die for confession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that the rest may imitate you.</p>

<p>6. But this, as we have said, brethren, is perfect charity. He that is born of God has it. Mark, my beloved, see what I say. Behold, a man has received the Sacrament of that birth, being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; he has the Sacrament, and a great Sacrament, divine, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, ineffable. Consider what a Sacrament! To make him a new man by remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>! Nevertheless, let him look well to the heart, whether that be thoroughly done there, which is done in the body; let him see whether he have charity, and then say, I am born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If however he have it not, he has indeed the soldier's mark upon him, but he roams as a deserter. Let him have charity; otherwise let him not say that he is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But he says, I have the Sacrament. Hear the Apostle: <q>If I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>,  and have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that I can remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172259"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:2</a></span> </p>

<p>7. This, if you remember, we gave you to understand in beginning to read this Epistle, that nothing in it is so commended as charity. Even if it seems to speak of various other things, to this it makes its way back, and whatever it says, it will needs bring all to bear upon charity. Let us see whether it does so here. Mark: <q>Whosoever is born of God does not commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> We ask, what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Because if you understand all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it will be contrary to that place, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> Then let him say what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; let him teach us; lest haply I may have rashly said that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> here is the violation of charity, because he said above, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not whither he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172260"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:11</a></span> But perhaps he has said something in what comes afterwards, and has mentioned charity by name? See that this circuit of words has this end, has this issue. <q>Whosoever is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not, because His seed remains in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172261"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:9</a></span> The <q>seed</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <em> i.e.</em> the word of God: whence the apostle says, <q>I have begotten you through the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. And he cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, because he is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172262"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:15</a></span> Let him tell us this, let us see in what we cannot <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <q>In this are manifested the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Whosoever is not righteous is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither he that loves not his brother.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172263"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:10</a></span> Aye, now indeed it is manifest of what he speaks: <q>Neither he that loves not his brother.</q> Therefore, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> alone puts the difference between the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Let them all sign themselves with the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; let them all respond, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>; let all sing <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>; let all be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, let all come to church, let all build the walls of churches: there is no discerning of the children of God from the children of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but only by charity. They that have charity are born of God: they that have it not, are not born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A mighty token, a mighty distinction! Have what you will; if this alone you have not, it profits you nothing: other things if you have not, have this, and you have fulfilled the law. <q>For he that loves another has fulfilled the law,</q> says the apostle: and, <q>Charity is the fulfilling of the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172264"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;13:8,&nbsp;10</a></span> I take this to be the pearl which the merchant man in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is described to have been seeking, who  <q>found one pearl, and sold all that he had, and bought it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172265"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;13:46</a></span> This is the pearl of price, Charity, without which whatever you may have, profits you nothing: which if alone you have, it suffices you. Now, with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you see, then with actual beholding  you shall see. For if we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> when we see not, how shall we embrace it when we see! But wherein must we exercise ourselves? In brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. You may say to me, I have not seen God: can you say to me, I have not seen man? Love your brother. For if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your brother whom you see, at the same time you shall see God also; because you shall see Charity itself, and within dwells God.</p>

<p>8. <q>Whosoever is not righteous is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither he that loves not his brother.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172267"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:10-11</a></span> <q>For this is the message:</q> mark how he confirms it: <q>For this is the message which we heard from the beginning, that we should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> He has made it manifest to us that it is of this he speaks; whoso acts against this commandment, is in that accursed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, into which those fall who are not born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Not as Cain, who was of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and his brother's righteous.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172268"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:12</a></span> Therefore, where <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> is, brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> cannot be. Mark, my beloved. He that envies, loves not. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is in that man; because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> cast man down. For he fell, and envied him that stood. He did not wish to cast man down that he himself might stand, but only that he might not fall alone. Hold fast in your mind from this that he has subjoined, that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> cannot exist in charity. You have it openly, when charity was praised, <q>Charity envies not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172269"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:4</a></span> There was no charity in Cain; and had there been no charity in Abel, God would not have accepted his <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. For when they had both offered, the one of the fruits of the earth, the other of the offspring of the flock; what think ye, brethren, that God slighted the fruits of the earth, and loved the offspring of the flock? God had not regard to the hands, but saw in the heart: and whom He saw offer with charity, to his <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> He had respect; whom He saw offer with <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, from his <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> He turned away His eyes. By the good works, then, of Abel, he means only charity: by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works of Cain he means only his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of his brother. It was not enough that he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his brother and envied his good works; because he would not imitate, he would kill. And hence it appeared that he was a child of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and hence also that the other was God's righteous one. Hence then are men discerned, my brethren. Let no man mark the tongue, but the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and the heart. If any do not good for his brethren, he shows what he has in him. By <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> are men <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.</p>

<p>9. <q>Marvel not, brethren, if the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us.</q>  Must one often be telling you what <q>the world</q> means? Not the heaven, not the earth, nor these visible works which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made; but lovers of the world. By often saying these things, to some I am burdensome: but I am so far from saying it without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that some may be questioned whether I said it, and they cannot answer. Let then, even by thrusting it upon them, something stick fast in the hearts of them that hear. What is <q>the world</q>? The world, when put in a bad sense, is, lovers of the world: the world, when the word is used in praise, is heaven and earth, and the works of God that are in them; whence it is said, <q>And the world was made by Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172271"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;1:10</a></span> Also, the world is the fullness of the earth, as John himself has said, <q>Not only for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is He the propitiator, but (for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>) of the whole world:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172272"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:2</a></span> he means, <q>of the world,</q> of all the faithful scattered throughout the whole earth. But the world in a bad sense, is, lovers of the world. They that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, cannot <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their brother.</p>

<p>10. <q>If the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us: we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></q>&mdash; What do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>?&mdash; <q>that we have passed from death unto life</q>&mdash; How do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? <q>Because we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brethren.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172273"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:14</a></span> Let none ask man: let each return to his own heart: if he find there brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, let him set his mind at rest, because he is <q>passed from death unto life.</q> Already he is on the right hand: let him not regard that at present his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is hidden: when the Lord shall come, then shall he appear in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For he has life in him, but as yet in winter; the root is alive, but the branches, so to say, are dry: within is the substance that has the life in it, within are the leaves of trees, within are the fruits: but they wait for the summer. Well then, <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have passed from death unto life, because we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brethren. He that loves not, abides in death.</q> Lest ye should think it a light matter, brethren, to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, or, not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, hear what follows: <q>Every one that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother, is a murderer.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172274"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:15</a></span> How now, if any made light of hating his brother, will he also in his heart make light of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>? He does not stir his hands to kill a man; yet he is already held by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> a murderer; the other lives, and yet this man is already judged as his slayer! <q>Every one that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer: and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that no murderer has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life abiding in him.</q></p>

<p>11. <q>In this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172275"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:16</a></span> he means, perfection of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that perfection which we have bidden you lay to heart: <q>In this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that He laid down His life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</q> Lo here, whence that came: <q>Peter, do you love me? Feed My sheep.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172276"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;21:15-19</a></span> For, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He would have His sheep to be so fed by him, as that he should lay down his life for the sheep, straightway said He this to him: <q>When you were young, you girded yourself, and walked whither you would, but when you shall be old, you shall stretch forth your hands, and another shall gird you, and carry you whither you would not. This spoke He,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, <q>signifying by what death he should glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> so that to whom He had said, Feed my sheep, the same He might teach to lay down his life for His sheep.</p>

<p>12. Whence begins charity, brethren? Attend a little: to what it is perfected, you have heard; the very end of it, and the very measure of it is what the Lord has put before us in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has no man,</q> says He, <q>than that one lay down his life for his friends.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172277"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;15:13</a></span> Its perfection, therefore, He has put before us in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and here also it is its perfection that is put before us: but you ask yourselves, and say to yourselves, When shall it be possible for us to have <q>this</q> charity? Do not too soon despair of yourself. Haply, it is born and is not yet perfect; nourish it, that it be not choked. But you will say to me, And by what am I to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it? For to what it is perfected, we have heard; whence it begins, let us hear. He goes on to say: <q>But whoso has this world's good, and sees his brother have hunger,  and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how can the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God dwell in him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172279"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Lo, whence charity begins withal!  If you are not yet equal to the dying for your brother, be even now equal to the giving of your means to your brother. Even now let charity smite your bowels, that not of vainglory you should do it, but of the innermost  marrow of mercy; that you consider him, now in want. For if your superfluities you can not give to your brother, can you lay down your life for your brother? There lies your money in your bosom, which thieves may take from you; and though thieves do not take it, by dying you will leave it, even if it leave not you while living: what will you do with it? Your brother hungers, he is in necessity: belike he is in suspense, is distressed by his creditor: he is your brother, alike you are bought, one is the price paid for you, you are both redeemed by the blood of Christ: see whether you have mercy, if you have this world's means. Perchance you say, <q>What concerns it me? Am I to give my money, that he may not suffer trouble?</q> If this be the answer your heart makes to you, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father abides not in you. If the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father abide not in you, you are not born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. How do you boast to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? You have the name, and hast not the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. But if the work shall follow the name, let any call you pagan, show by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that you are a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. For if by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> you do not show yourself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> may call you a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> yet; what does the name profit you where the thing is not forthcoming? <q>But whoso has this world's good, and sees his brother have need,  and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how can the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God dwell in him?</q> And then he goes on: <q>My little children, let us not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in word, neither in tongue but in deed and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172283"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:18</a></span> </p>

<p>13. I suppose the thing is now made manifest to you my brethren: this great and most concerning secret and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>.  What is the force of charity, all Scripture does set forth; but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether any where it be more largely set forth than in this Epistle. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you and beseech you in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, that both what you have heard you will keep in memory, and to that which is yet to be said, until the epistle be finished, will come with earnestness, and with earnestness hear the same. But open ye your heart for the good seed: root out the thorns, that that which we are sowing in you be not choked, but rather that the harvest may grow, and that the Husbandman may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and make ready the barn for you as for grain, not the fire as for the chaff.</p>
