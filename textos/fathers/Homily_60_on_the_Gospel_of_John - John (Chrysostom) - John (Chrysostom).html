<h1>Homily 60 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 10:14-15</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>I am the Good Shepherd, and know My sheep, and am known of Mine. As the Father knows Me, even so know I the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep.</q></div>

<p>1. A great matter, beloved, a great matter it is to preside over a Church: a matter needing wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> as great as that of which Christ speaks, that a man should lay down his life for the sheep, and never leave them deserted or naked; that he should stand against the wolf nobly. For in this the shepherd differs from the hireling; the one always looks to his own safety, caring not for the sheep; the other always seeks that of the sheep, neglecting his own. Having therefore mentioned the marks of a shepherd, Christ has put two kinds of spoilers; one, the thief who kills and steals; the other, one who does not these things, but who when they are done does not give heed nor hinder them. By the first, pointing to Theudas and those like him; by the second, exposing the teachers of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who neither cared for nor thought about the sheep entrusted to them. On which account Ezekiel of old rebuked them, and said, <q>Woe,  ye shepherds of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>! Do the shepherds feed themselves? Do not the shepherds feed the sheep?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse2">Ezekiel 34:2</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> But they did the contrary, which is the worst kind of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all the rest. Wherefore It says, <q>They have not turned back the strayed, nor sought the lost, nor bound up the broken, nor healed the sick, because they fed themselves and not the sheep.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse4">Ezekiel 34:4</a></span> As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also has declared in another passage, saying, <q>For all seek their own, not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians 2:21</a></span>; and again, <q>Let no man seek his own, but every man his neighbor's.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 10:24</a></span>  From both Christ distinguishes Himself; from those who came to spoil, by saying, <q>I have come that they might have life, and that they might have more abundantly</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse10">John 10:10</a></span>; and from those who cared not for the sheep being carried away by wolves, by never deserting them, but even laying down His life for them, that the sheep might not perish. For when they desired to kill Him, He neither altered His teaching, nor betrayed those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him, but stood firm, and chose to die. Wherefore He continually said, <q>I am the good Shepherd.</q> Then because His words appeared to be unsupported by testimony, (for though the, <q>I lay down My life,</q> was not long after <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, yet the, <q>that they might have life, and that they might have more abundantly,</q> was to come to pass after their departure hence in the life to come,) what does He? He proves one from the other; by giving His mortal life  (He proves) that He gives life <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.  As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says, <q>If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse10">Romans 5:10</a></span> And again in another place, <q>He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans 8:32</a></span></p>

<p>But wherefore do they not now bring against Him the charge which they did before, when they said, <q>You bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of yourself, your <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse13">John 8:13</a></span> Because He had often stopped their mouths, and because His boldness towards them had been increased by His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Then because He said above <q>And the sheep hear his voice, and follow him,</q> lest any should say, <q>What then is this to those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not?</q> hear what He adds, <q>And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> My sheep, and am <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Mine.</q> As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declared when he said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has not rejected His people whom He foreknew</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse2">Romans 11:2</a></span>; and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> those that were His</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2 Timothy 2:19</a>; comp. <a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse5">Numbers 16:5</a></span>; <q>those,</q> He says, <q>I mean, whom He  foreknew.</q> Then that you may not deem the measure of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to be equal, hear how He sets the matter right by adding, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> My sheep, and am <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> of Mine.</q> But the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is not equal. <q>Where is it equal?</q> In the case of the Father and Me, for there, <q>As the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Me, even so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I the Father.</q> Had He not wished to prove this, why should He have added that expression? Because He often ranked Himself among the many, therefore, lest any one should deem that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, He added, <q>As the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Me, even so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I the Father.</q> <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him as exactly as He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Me.</q> Wherefore He said, <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son  save the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor the Father save the Son</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse22">Luke 10:22</a></span>, speaking of a distinct kind of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and such as no other can possess.</p>

<p>2. <q>I lay down My life.</q> This He says continually, to show that He is no deceiver. So also the Apostle, when he desired to show that he was a genuine teacher, and was arguing against the false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, established his authority by his dangers and deaths, saying, <q>In stripes above measure, in deaths oft.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse23">2 Corinthians 11:23</a></span> For to say, <q>I am light,</q> and <q>I am life,</q> seemed to the foolish to be a matter of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; but to say, <q>I am willing to die,</q> admitted not any <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> or <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. Wherefore they do not say to Him, <q>You bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of yourself, your <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>,</q> for the speech manifested very tender care for them, if indeed He was willing to give Himself for those who would have <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> Him. On this account also He seasonably introduces mention of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>;</p>

<h2>John 10:16</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>For other sheep also I have, which are not of this fold, them also must I bring.</q></div>

<p>Observe again, the word <q>must,</q> here used, does not express necessity, but is declaratory of something which will certainly come to pass. As though He had said, <q>Why marvel ye if these shall follow Me, and if My sheep shall hear My voice? When you shall see others also following Me and hearing My voice, then shall you be astonished more.</q> And be not confounded when you hear Him say, <q>which are not of this fold</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6"Galatians 5:6</a></span>, for the difference relates to the Law only, as also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> avails anything, nor uncircumcision.</q></p>

<p><q>Them also must I bring.</q> He shows that both these and those were scattered and mixed, and without shepherds, because the good Shepherd had not yet come. Then He proclaims beforehand their future union, that,</p>

<p><q>They shall be one fold.</q> </p>

<p>Which same thing also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>  declared, saying, <q>For to make in Himself of two one new man.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse15">Ephesians 2:15</a></span></p>

<h2>John 10:17</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Therefore does My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I might take it again.</q></div>

<p>What could be more full of humanity than this saying, if so be that on our account our Lord shall be beloved, because He dies for us? What then? Tell me, was He not beloved during the time before this; did the Father now begin to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, and were we the causes of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Do you see how He used condescension? But what does He here desire to prove? Because  they said that He was alien from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and a deceiver, and had come to ruin and destroy He tells them, <q>This if nothing else would persuade Me to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, namely, your being so beloved by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, that I also am beloved by Him, because I die for you.</q> Besides this He desires also to prove that other point, that He came not to the action unwillingly, (for it unwillingly, how could what was done <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>?) and that this was especially <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the Father. And if He speaks as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, marvel not, for we have often mentioned the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this, and to say again the same things is superfluous and unpleasant.</p>

<p><q>I lay down My life, that I might take it again.</q></p>

<h2>John 10:18</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>No man takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</q></div>

<p>Because they often took counsel to kill Him, He tells them, <q>Except I will, your labor is unavailing.</q> And by the first He proves the second, by the Death, the Resurrection. For this is the strange and wonderful thing. Since both took place in a new way, and beyond ordinary custom. But let us give heed exactly to what He says, <q>I have power to lay down My life.</q> And who has not <q>power to lay down his life</q>? Since it is in the power of any that will, to kill himself. But He says it not so, but how? <q>I have in such a way the power to lay it down, that no one can effect this against My will.</q> And this is a power not belonging to men; for we have no power to lay it down in any other way than by killing ourselves. And if we fall into the hands of men who plot against us, and have the power to kill us, we no longer are free to lay it down or not, but even against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> they take it from us. Now this was not the case with Christ, but even when others plotted against Him, He had power not to lay it down. Having therefore said that, <q>No man takes it from Me,</q> He adds, <q>I have power to lay down My life,</q> that is, <q>I alone can decide as to laying it down,</q> a thing which does not rest with us,  for many others also are able to take it from us. Now this He said not at first, (since the assertion would not have seemed credible,) but when He had received the testimony of facts, and when, having often plotted against Him, they had been unable to lay hold on Him, (for He escaped from their hands ten thousand times,) He then says, <q>No man takes it from me.</q> But if this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that other point follows, that He came to death voluntarily. And if this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the next point is also certain, that He can <q>take it again</q> when He will. For if the dying  was a greater thing than man could do, <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> no more about the other. Since the fact that He alone was able to let go His life, shows that He was able by the same power to take it again. Do you see how from the first He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the second, and from His death showed that His Resurrection was indisputable?</p>

<p><q>This commandment have I received of My Father.</q></p>

<p>What commandment was this? To die for the world. Did He then wait first to hear, and then choose, and had He need of learning it? Who that had sense would assert this? But before when He said, <q>Therefore does My Father <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Me,</q> He showed that the first motion was <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>, and removed all suspicion of opposition to the Father; so here when He says that He received a commandment from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He declared nothing save that, <q>this which I do seems good to Him,</q> in order that when they should slay Him, they might not think that they had slain Him as one deserted and given up by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor reproach Him with such reproaches as they did, <q>He saved others, himself he cannot save</q>; and, <q>If you be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, come down from the cross</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse42">Matthew 27:42</a></span>; yet the very reason of His not coming down was, that He was the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>3. Then lest on hearing that, <q>I have received a command from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> you should deem that the achievement  does not belong to Him, He has said preventing the, <q>The good Shepherd lays down His life for the sheep</q>; showing by this that the sheep were His, and that all which took place was His achievement, and that He needed no command. For had He needed a commandment, how could He have said, <q>I lay it down of Myself</q>? For He that lays it down of Himself needs no commandment. He also assigns the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which He does this. And what is that? That He is the Shepherd, and the good Shepherd. Now the good Shepherd needs no one to arouse him to his duty; and if this be the case with man, much more is it so with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, that <q>He emptied Himself.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7</a></span> So the <q>commandment</q> put here means nothing else, but to show His unanimity with the Father; and if He speaks in so <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> a way, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is the infirmity of His hearers.</p>

<h2>John 10:19</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>There was a division therefore  among the Jews.  And some  said, He has a devil (and is mad ). Others said, These are not the words of him that has a devil: can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</q></div>

<p>For because His words were greater than belonged to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and not of common use, they  said that He had a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, calling Him so now for the fourth time. For they before had said, <q>You have a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who seeks to kill you?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse20">John 7:20</a></span>; and again, <q>Said we not well that you are a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, and hast a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse48">John 8:48</a></span>; and here, <q>He has a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and is mad, why hear ye him?</q> Or rather we should say, that He heard this not for the fourth time, but frequently. For to ask, <q>Said we not well that you have a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>?</q> is a sign that they had said so not twice or thrice, but many times. <q>Others said, These are not the words of him that has a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: &nbsp;can a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> open the eyes of the blind?</q> For since they could not silence their opponents by words, they now brought <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from His works. <q>Certainly neither are the words those of one that has a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, yet if you are not persuaded by the words, be ye shamed by the works. For if they are not the acts of one that has a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and are greater than belong to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it is quite clear that they proceed from some divine power.</q> Do you see the argument? That they were greater than belonged to man is plain, from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> saying, <q>He has a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></q>; that He had not a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, He showed by what He did.</p>

<p>What then did Christ? He answered nothing to these things. Before this He had replied, <q>I have not a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></q>; but not so now; for since He had afforded <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> by His actions, He afterwards held His peace. For neither were they worthy of an answer, who said that He was possessed of a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, on account of those actions for which they ought to have admired and deemed Him to be God. And how were any farther refutations from Him needed, when they opposed and refuted each other? Wherefore He was silent, and bore all mildly. And not for this reason alone, but also to teach us all meekness and long-suffering.</p>

<p>4. Let us now imitate Him. For not only did He now hold His peace, but even came among them again,  and being questioned answered and showed the things relating to His foreknowledge; and though called <q><a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniac</a></q> and <q>madman,</q> by men who had received from Him ten thousand benefits, and that not once or twice but many times, not only did He refrain from avenging Himself, but even ceased not to benefit them. To benefit, do I say? He laid down His life for them, and while being crucified spoke in their behalf to His Father. This then let us also imitate, for to be a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is the being gentle and kind. But whence can this gentleness come to us? If we continually reckon up our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if we mourn, if we weep; for neither does a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that dwells in the company of so much grief endure to be provoked or angered. Since wherever there is mourning, it is impossible that there should be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>; where grief is, all <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is out of the way; where there is brokenness of spirit, there is no provocation. For the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, when scourged by sorrow, has not leisure to be roused, but will groan  bitterly, and weep yet more bitterly. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many laugh on hearing these things, but I will not cease to lament for the laughers. For the present is a time for mourning, and wailings, and lamentations, since we do many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> both in word and deed, and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> awaits those who commit such transgressions, and the river boiling with a roaring stream of fire, and banishment from the Kingdom, which is the most grievous thing of all. When these things then are threatened, tell me, do you laugh and bear you proudly? And when your Lord is angered and threatening, do you stand careless,  and do you not fear lest by this thou light for yourself the furnace to a blaze? Do you not hear what He cries out every day? <q>You saw Me  an hungered, and gave Me no meat; thirsty, and you gave Me no drink; depart ye into the fire prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm">Matthew 25</a></span> And these things He threatened every day. <q>But,</q> says some one, <q>I did give Him meat.</q> When, and for how many days? Ten or twenty? But He wills it not merely for so much time as this, but as much as you spend upon earth. For the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> also had oil, yet not sufficient for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; they too lighted their lamps, yet they were shut out from the bridechamber. And with reason, since the lamps had gone out before the coming of the Bridegroom. On this account we need much oil, and abundant lovingkindness. Hear at least what the Prophet says, <q>Have mercy upon me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to Your great mercy.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa050.htm#verse1">Psalm 51:1</a></span> We therefore must so take pity upon our neighbor, according to His great mercy towards us. For such as we are towards our fellow-servants, such shall we find our Lord towards ourselves. And what kind of <q>mercy</q> is <q>great</q>? When we give not of our abundance, but of our deficiency. But if we give not even of our abundance, what hope shall there be for us? Whence shall we have deliverance from those woes? Where shall we be enabled to flee and to find <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? For if the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> after so many and so great toils found no comfort anywhere, who shall stand forth for us when we hear those fearful words of the Judge Himself, addressing and reproaching us, because <q>I was an hungered, and you gave Me no meat; for inasmuch,</q> It says, <q>as you did it not unto one of the least of these, you did it not unto Me</q>; saying this not  merely of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, nor of those who have taken upon themselves the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life, but of every faithful man. For such an one though he be a slave, or one of those that beg in the market-place, yet if he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ought by right to enjoy all our good will. And if we neglect such an one when naked or hungry, we shall hear those words. With reason. For what difficult or grievous thing has He demanded of us? What that is not of the very lightest and easiest? He says not, <q>I was sick, and you restored Me not,</q> but, <q>and you visited Me not.</q> He says not, <q>I was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and you delivered Me not,</q> but, <q>and you came not unto Me.</q> In proportion therefore as the commands are easy, so is the punishment greater to them that disobey. For what is easier, tell me, than to walk forth and enter into a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>? And what more pleasant? For when you see some bound, others covered with filth, others with uncut hair and clothed in rags, others perishing with hunger, and running like dogs to your feet, others with deep ploughed sides,  others now returning in chains from the market-place, who beg all day and do not collect even necessary sustenance, and yet at evening are required by those set over them to furnish that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and savage service;  though thou be like any stone, you will certainly be rendered kinder; though you live a soft and dissipated life, you will certainly become wiser, when you observe the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs in other men's misfortunes; for you will surely gain an idea of that fearful day, and of its varied punishments. Revolving and considering these things, you will certainly cast out both <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and pleasure, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of worldly things, and wilt make your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more calm than the calmest harbor; and you will reason concerning that Judgment seat, reflecting that if among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> there is so much forethought, and order, and terror, and threatenings, much more will there be with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For there is no power but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse1">Romans 13:1</a></span> He therefore who permits rulers to order these things thus, will much more do the same Himself.</p>

<p>5. And certainly were there not this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, all would be lost, when though such punishments hang over them, there are many who go over to the side of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. These things if you wisely observe, you will be more ready-minded towards alms-doing, and wilt reap much pleasure, far greater than those who come down from the theater. For they when they remove from thence are inflamed and burn with desire. Having seen those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> hovering  on the stage, and received from them ten thousand wounds, they will be in no better condition than a tossing sea, when the image of the faces, the gestures, the speeches, the walk, and all the rest, stand before their eyes and besiege their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But they who come forth from a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> will suffer nothing of this kind, but will enjoy great calm and tranquillity. For the compunction arising from the sight of the prisoners, quenches all that fire. And if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that is an harlot and a wanton meet a man coming forth from among the prisoners, she will work him no mischief. For becoming for the time to come, as it were, incapable of molding,  he will thus not be taken by the nets of her countenance, because instead of that wanton countenance there will then be placed before his eyes the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Judgment. On this account, he who had gone over every kind of luxury said, <q>It is better to go into the house of mourning than into the house of mirth.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes 7:2</a></span> And so <q>here</q> you will show forth great wisdom, and <q>there</q> wilt hear those words which are worth ten thousand blessings. Let us then not neglect such a practice and occupation. For although we be not able to bring them food, nor to help them by giving money, yet shall we be able to comfort them by our words, and to raise up the drooping spirit, and to help them in many other ways by conversing with those who cast them into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and by making their keepers kinder, and we certainly shall effect either small or great good. But if you say that the men there are neither men of condition,  nor good, nor gentle, but man-slayers, tomb-breakers, cut-purses, adulterers, intemperate, and full of many wickednesses, by this again you show to me a pressing reason for spending time there. For we are not commanded to take pity on the good and to punish the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but to manifest this lovingkindness to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. <q>Be,</q> It says, <q>like to My Father  which is in heaven, for He makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew 5:45</a></span> Do not then accuse other men's faults bitterly, nor be a severe judge, but mild and merciful. For we also, if we have not been adulterers, or tomb-breakers, or cut-purses, yet have we other transgressions which deserve <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> punishment. Perchance we have called our brother <q>fool,</q> which prepares  for us the pit; we have looked on <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with unchastened eyes, which constitutes absolute <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; and what is more  grievous than all, we partake not worthily of the Mysteries, which makes us guilty of the Body and Blood of  Christ. Let us then not be bitter enquirers into the conduct of others, but consider our own state, so shall we desist from this inhumanity and cruelty. Besides this, it may be said that we shall there find many good men, and often men worth as much as all the city. Since even that prison-house in which Joseph was had in it many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, yet that just man had the care of them all, and was, with the rest, concealed as to his real character; for he was worth as much as all the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, yet still he dwelt in the prison-house, and no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him of those that were within it. Thus also even now it is likely that there are  many good and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> men, though they be not visible to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and the care you take of such as these gives you a return for your exertions in favor of the whole. Or if there be none such, still even in this case great is your recompense; for your Lord conversed not with the just only, while He avoided the unclean, but received with kindness both the Canaanitish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and her of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, the abominable and impure; another also who was a harlot, on whose account the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> reproached Him, He both received and healed, and allowed His feet to be washed by the tears of the polluted one, teaching us to condescend to those that are in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for this most of all is kindness. What do you say? Do <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> and tomb-breakers dwell in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>? And, tell me, are all they just men that dwell in the city? Nay, are there not many worse even than these, robbing with greater shamelessness? For the one sort, if there be no other excuse for them, at least put before themselves the veil of solitude and darkness, and the doing these things clandestinely; but the others throw away the mask and go after their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> with uncovered head, being violent, grasping, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>. Hard it is to find a man pure from <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>.</p>

<p>6. If we do not take by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> gold, or such and such a number of acres of land, yet we bring about the same end by deceit and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> in lesser matters, and where we are able to do so. For when in making contracts, or when we must buy or sell anything, we dispute and strive to pay less than the value, and use our utmost endeavors to have it so, is not the action <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>? Is it not theft and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>? Tell not me that you have not wrested away houses or slaves, for <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is judged not by the measure of the things taken, but by the intention of those who commit the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>. Since <q>just</q> and <q><a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a></q> have the same force in great and in little things; and I call cut-purses alike the man who cuts through a purse and takes the gold, and him who buying from any of the market people deducts something from the proper price; nor is he the only house-breaker who breaks through a wall and steals anything within, but that man also who corrupts <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and takes anything from his neighbor.</p>

<p>Let us not then pass by our own faults, and become judges of other men's; nor let us, when it is time for lovingkindness, be searching out their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; but considering what our own state was once, let us now be gentle and kind. What then was our state? Hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> say; <q>For we ourselves also were sometime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and pleasures, hateful, and hating one another</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse3">Titus 3:3</a></span>; and again, <q>We were by nature children of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse3">Ephesians 2:3</a></span> But God seeing us as it were confined in a prison-house, and bound with grievous chains, far more grievous than those of iron, was not ashamed of us, but came and entered the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and, though we deserved ten thousand punishments, both brought us out from hence, and brought us to a kingdom, and made us more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than the heaven, that we also might do the same according to our power. For when He says to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>If I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet; for I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse14">John 13:14</a></span>, He writes this law not merely for the <a href="../cathen/15557b.htm">washing the feet</a>, but also in all the other acts which He manifested towards us. Is it a manslayer who inhabits the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>? Yet let not us be weary in doing Him good. Is it a tomb-breaker, or an adulterer? Let us pity not his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but his calamity. But often, as I before said, one will be found there worth ten thousand; and if you go continually to the prisoners, you shall not miss so great a prize. For as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, by entertaining even common guests, once met with Angels, so shall we meet with great men too, if we make the action a business. And if I may make a strange assertion, he who entertains a great man is not so worthy of praise as he who receives the wretched and miserable. For the former has, in his own life, no slight occasion of being well treated, but the other, rejected and given up by all, has one only harbor, the pity of his benefactor; so that this most of all is pure kindness. He, moreover, who shows attention to an admired and illustrious man, does it often for ostentation among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but he who tends the abject and despairing, does it only because of the command of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore, if we make a feast, we are bidden to entertain the lame and halt, and if we do works of mercy, we are bidden to do them to the least and meanest. <q>For,</q> It says, <q>inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these, you have done it unto Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse45">Matthew 25:45</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a>, therefore, the treasure which  is laid up in that place,  let us enter continually, and make it our business, and turn  there our eager feelings about theaters. If you have nothing to contribute, contribute the comfort of your words. For God recompenses not only him that feeds, but him also who goes in. When you enter and arouses the trembling and fearful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, exhorting, succoring, promising assistance, teaching it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, you shall thence reap no small reward. For if you should speak in such manner outside the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, many will even laugh, being dissipated  by their excessive luxury: but those who are in adversity, having their minds humbled, shall meekly attend to your words, and praise them, and become better men. Since even when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preached, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> often derided him, but the prisoners listened with much stillness. For nothing renders the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so fit for heavenly wisdom as calamity and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and the pressure of affliction. Considering all these things, and how much good we shall work both to those within the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and to ourselves, by being continually mixed  up with them, let us there spend the time we used to spend in the market-place, and in unseasonable occupations, that we may both win them and gladden ourselves, and by causing God to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, may obtain the everlasting blessings, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom and with whom, to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
