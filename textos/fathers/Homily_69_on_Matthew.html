<h1>Homily 69 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse1">Matt. XXII. 1-14</a>.</strong></p>

<p><q> <em>And Jesus answered and spoke again</em>  <em>in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>. The kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> is like a certain king, which made a marriage</em>  <em>for his son; and sent forth his servants to call them which were bidden to the wedding; and they would not come. Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come unto the marriage. But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise: and the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.</em></q>  </p>

<p>Do you see both in the former <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> and in this the difference between the Son and the servants? Do you see at once the great affinity between both <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a>, and the great difference also? For this also indicates God's  long-suffering, and His great <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> care, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews'</a> ingratitude.</p>

<p>But this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> has something also more than the other. For it proclaims beforehand both the casting out of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and it indicates together with this also the strictness of the life required, and how great the punishment appointed for the careless.</p>

<p>And well is this placed after the other. For since He had said, <q>It shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof,</q> He declares next to what kind of nation; and not this only, but He also again sets forth His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> care towards the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> as past utterance. For there He appears before His crucifixion bidding them; but here even after He is slain, He still urges them, striving to win them over. And when they deserved to have suffered the most grievous punishment, then He both presses them to the marriage, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> them with the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. And see how both there He calls not the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> first, but the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and here again. But as there, when they would not receive Him, but even slew Him when He had come, then He gave away the vineyard; thus here too, when they were not willing to be present at the marriage, then He called others.</p>

<p>What then could be more ungrateful than they, when being bidden to a marriage they rush away? For who would not choose to come to a marriage, and that a King's marriage, and of a King making a marriage for a Son?</p>

<p>And wherefore is it called a marriage? One may say. That you might learn God's tender care, His yearning towards us, the cheerfulness of the state of things, that there is nothing sorrowful there, nor sad, but all things are full of spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Therefore also John calls Him a bridegroom, therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> again says, <q>For I have espoused you to one husband;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202596"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span> and, <q>This is a great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, but I speak concerning Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202597"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse32">Ephesians&nbsp;5:32</a></span> </p>

<p>Why then is not the bride said to be espoused to Him, but to the Son? Because she that is espoused to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, is espoused to the Father. For it is indifferent in Scripture that the one or the other should be said, because of the identity of the substance.</p>

<p>Hereby He proclaimed the resurrection also. For since in what went before He had spoken of the death, He shows that even after the death, then is the marriage, then the bridegroom.</p>

<p>But not even so do these become better men nor more gentle, than which what can be worse? For this again is a third accusation. The first that they killed the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; then the son; afterwards that even when they had slain Him, and were bidden unto the marriage of Him that was slain, by the very one that was slain, they come not, but feign excuses, yokes of oxen, and pieces of ground, and wives. And yet the excuses seem to be reasonable; but hence we learn, though the things which hinder us be necessary, to set the things spiritual at a higher price than all.</p>

<p>And He not suddenly, but a long time before. For, <q>Tell,</q> He says, <q>them that are bidden;</q> and again, <q>Call them that were bidden;</q> which circumstance makes the charge against them heavier. And when were they bidden? By all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; by John again; for unto Christ he would pass all on, saying, <q>He must increase, I must decrease;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202599"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;3:30</a></span> by the Son Himself again, <q>Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you;</q> and again, <q>If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202601"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37</a></span> </p>

<p>But not by words only, but also by actions did He bid them, after His ascension by Peter, and those with him. <q>For He that wrought effectually in Peter,</q> it is said, <q>to the apostleship of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, was mighty also in me towards the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q>  </p>

<p>For since on seeing the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, they were <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and slew Him, He bids them again by His servants. And unto what does He bid them? Unto labors, and toils, and sweat? Nay but unto pleasure. For, <q>My oxen,</q> He says, <q>and my fatlings are killed.</q> See how complete His banquet, how great His munificence.</p>

<p>And not even this shamed them, but the more long-suffering He showed, so much the more were they hardened. For not for press of business, but from <q>making light of it,</q> they did not come.</p>

<p><q>How then do some bring forward marriages, others yokes of oxen? These things surely are of want of leisure.</q></p>

<p>By no means, for when spiritual things call us, there is no press of business that has the power of necessity.</p>

<p>And to me they seem moreover to make use of these excuses, putting forward these things as cloke for their negligence. And not this only is the grievous thing, that they came not, but also that which is a far more violent  and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> act, to have even beaten them that came, and to have used them despitefully, and to have slain them; this is worse than the former. For those others came, demanding produce and fruits, and were slain; but these, bidding them to the marriage of Him that had been slain by them, and these again are murdered.</p>

<p>What is equal to this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>? This <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also was laying to their charge, when he said, <q>Who both killed the Lord, and their own <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> us.</q>  </p>

<p>Moreover, that they may not say, <q>He is an adversary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore we do not come,</q> hear what they say who are bidding them; that it is the father who is making the marriage, and that it is He who is bidding them.</p>

<p>What then did He after these things? Since they were not willing to come, yea and also slew those that came unto them; He burns up their cities, and sent His armies and slew them.</p>

<p>And these things He says, declaring beforehand the things that took place under <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> and Titus, and that they provoked the father also, by not believing in Him; it is the father at any rate who was avenging.</p>

<p>And for this reason let me add, not straightway after Christ was slain did the capture take place, but after forty years, that He might show His long suffering, when they had slain Stephen, when they had put James to death, when they had spitefully entreated the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.</p>

<p>Do you see the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the event, and its quickness? For while John was yet living, and many other of them that were with Christ, these things came to pass, and they that had heard these words were witnesses of the events.</p>

<p>See then care utterable. He had planted a vineyard; He had done all things, and finished; when His servants had been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, He sent other servants; when those had been slain, He sent the son; and when He was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, He bids them to the marriage. They would not come. After this He sends other servants, and they slew these also.</p>

<p>Then upon this He slays them, as being incurably diseased. For that they were incurably diseased, was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not by their acts only, but by the fact, that even when harlots and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, they did these things. So that, not by their own crimes alone, but also from what others were able to do aright, these men are condemned,</p>

<p>But if any one should say, that not then were they out of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> called, I mean, when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had been beaten and had suffered ten thousand things, but straightway after the resurrection (for then He said to them, <q>Go ye and make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of all nations.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202605"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span>) We would say, that both before the crucifixion, and after the crucifixion, they addressed themselves to them first. For both before the crucifixion, He says to them, <q>Go to the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202606"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;10:6</a></span> and after the crucifixion, so far from forbidding, He even commanded them to address themselves to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For though He said, <q>Make <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of all nations,</q> yet when on the point of ascending into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, He declared that unto those first they were to address themselves; For, <q>you shall receive power,</q> says He, <q>after that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has come upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Jud&aelig;a, and unto the uttermost part of the earth;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202607"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;1:8</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> again, <q>He that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, was mighty in me also toward the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q>  Therefore the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> also went first unto the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and when they had tarried a long time in Jerusalem, and then had been driven away by them, in this way they were scattered abroad unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>2. And see thou even herein His bounty; <q>As many as you shall find,</q> says He, <q>bid to the marriage.</q> For before this, as I said, they addressed themselves both to <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks, tarrying for the most part in Jud&aelig;a; but since they continued to lay plots against them, hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> interpreting this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, and saying thus, <q>It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you, but since you judge yourselves unworthy, lo, we turn to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q>  </p>

<p>Therefore Christ also says, <q>The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</q></p>

<p>He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this indeed even before, but that He might leave them no pretext of a shameless sort of contradiction, although He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it, to them first He both came and sent, both stopping their mouths, and teaching us to fulfill all our parts, though no one should derive any profit.</p>

<p>Since then they were not worthy, go ye, says He, into the highways, and as many as you shall find, bid; both the common sort, and the outcasts. For because He had said in every way, <q>The harlots and <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> shall inherit heaven;</q> and, <q>The first shall  be last, and the last first;</q> He shows that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> do these things come to pass; which more than anything stung the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and goaded them far more grievously than their overthrow, to see those from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> brought into their privileges, and into far greater than theirs.</p>

<p>Then in order that not even these should put confidence in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> alone, He discourses unto them also concerning the judgment to be passed upon <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> actions; to them that have not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, of coming unto Him by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to them that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, of care with respect to their life. For the garment is life and practice.</p>

<p>And yet the calling was of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; wherefore then does He take a strict account? Because although to be called and to be cleansed was of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, yet, when called and clothed in clean garments, to continue keeping them so, this is of the diligence of them that are called.</p>

<p>The being called was not of merit, but of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. It was fit therefore to make a return for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and not to show forth such great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> after the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. <q>But I have not enjoyed,</q> one may say, <q>so much advantage as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</q> Nay, but you have enjoyed far greater benefits. For what things were being prepared for them throughout all their time, these you have received at once, not being worthy. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says, <q>And that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might glorify God for His mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202611"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;15:9</a></span> For what things were due to them, these you have received.</p>

<p>Wherefore also great is the punishment appointed for them that have been remiss. For as they did despite by not coming, so also thou by thus sitting down with a corrupt life. For to come in with filthy garments is this namely, to depart hence having one's life impure; wherefore also he was speechless.</p>

<p>Do you see how, although the fact was so manifest, He does not punish at once, until he himself, who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, has passed the sentence? For by having nothing to reply he condemned himself, and so is taken away to the unutterable torments.</p>

<p>For do not now, on hearing of darkness, suppose he is punished by this, by sending into a place where there is no light only, but where <q>there is</q> also <q>weeping and gnashing of teeth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202612"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;22:13</a></span> And this He says, indicating the intolerable pains.</p>

<p>Hear ye, as many as having partaken of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and having been present at the marriage, clothe your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> with filthy <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Hear whence you were called.</p>

<p>From the highway. Being what? Lame and halt in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, which is a much more grievous thing than the mutilation of the body. Reverence the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Him, who called you, and let no one continue to have filthy garments, but let each of you busy himself about the clothing of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Hear, you <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; hear, you men; we need not these garments that are bespangled with gold, <em>that adorn our outward parts</em>, but those others, that adorn the inward. Whilst we have these former, it is difficult to put on those latter. It is not possible at the same time to deck both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. It is not possible at the same time both to serve <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Christ as we ought.</p>

<p>Let us put off us therefore this grievous tyranny. For neither if any one were to adorn your house by hanging it with golden curtains, and were to make you sit there in rags, naked, would you endure it with meekness. But lo, now you do this to yourself, decking the house of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, I mean the body, with curtains beyond number, but leaving the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself to sit in rags. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> that the king ought to be adorned more than the city? So therefore while for the city hangings are prepared of linen, for the king there is a purple robe and a diadem. Even so do thou wrap the body with a much meaner dress, but the mind do thou clothe in purple, and put a crown on it, and set it on a high and conspicuous chariot. For now you are doing the opposite, decking the city in various ways, but suffering the king, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to be dragged bound after the brute <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>.</p>

<p>Rememberest thou not, that you are bidden to a marriage, and to God's marriage? Considerest thou not how the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is bidden ought to enter into those chambers, clad, and decked with fringes of gold.</p>

<p>3. Will you that I show you them that are clad thus, them that have on a marriage garment?</p>

<p>Call to mind those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, of whom I discoursed to you of late, them that wear garments of hair, them that dwell in the deserts. These above all are the wearers of the garments of that wedding; this is evident from hence, that how many soever purple robes thou were to give them, they would not choose to receive them; but much as a king, if any one were to take the beggar's rags, and exhort him to put them on, would abhor the clothing, so would those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> also his purple robe. And from no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> have they this feeling, but because of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the beauty of their own raiment. Therefore even  that purple robe they spurn like the spider's web. For these things has their sackcloth taught them; for indeed they are far more exalted and more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> than the very king who reigns.</p>

<p>And if you were able to open the doors of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and to look upon their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and all their ornaments within, surely you would fall down upon the earth, not bearing the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their beauty, and the splendor of those garments, and the lightning brightness of their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</p>

<p>For we could tell also of men of old, great and to be admired; but since visible examples lead on more those of grosser <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, therefore do I send you even to the tabernacles of those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For they have nothing sorrowful, but as if in heaven they had pitched their tents, even so are they encamped far off the wearisome things of this present life, in campaign against the devils; and as in choirs, so do they <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against him. Therefore I say, they have fixed their tents, and have fled from cities, and markets, and houses. For he that <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> cannot sit in a house, but he must make his habitation of a temporary kind, as on the point of removing straightway, and so dwell. Such are all those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, contrary to us. For we indeed live not as in a camp, but as in a city at peace.</p>

<p>For who in a camp ever lays foundation, and builds himself a house, which he is soon after to leave? There is not one; but should any one attempt it, he is <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> as a traitor. Who in a camp buys acres of land, and makes for himself trades? There is not one, and very reasonably. <q>For you have come here,</q> they would say, <q>to fight, not to traffic; why then do you trouble yourself about the place, which in a little time you will leave? When we are gone away to our country, do these things.</q></p>

<p>The same do I now say to you also. When we have removed to the city that is above, do these things: or rather you will have no need of labors there; after that the king will do all things for you. But here it is enough to dig a ditch round only, and to fix a palisade, but of building houses there is no need.</p>

<p>Hear what was the life of the Scythians, that lived in their wagons, such, as they say, are the habits of the shepherd tribes. So ought <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to live; to go about the world, warring against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, rescuing the captives held in subjection by him, and to be in freedom from all worldly things.</p>

<p>Why do you prepare a house, O man, that you may bind yourself more? Why do you bury a treasure, and invite the enemy against yourself? Why do you compass yourself with walls, and prepare a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> for yourself?</p>

<p>But if these things seem to you to be hard, let us go away unto the tents of those men, that by their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> we may learn the easiness thereof. For they having set up huts, if they must depart from these, depart like as soldiers, having left their camp in peace. For so likewise are they encamped, or rather even much more beautifully.</p>

<p>For indeed it is more pleasant to behold a desert containing huts of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in close succession, than soldiers stretching the canvas in a camp, and fixing spears, and suspending from the point of the spears saffron garments, and a multitude of men having heads of brass, and the bosses of the shields glistening much, and men armed all throughout with steel, and royal courts hastily made, and ground levelled far, and men dining and piping. For neither is this spectacle so delightful as that of which I now speak.</p>

<p>For if we were to go away into the wilderness, and look at the tents of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> soldiers, we shall see not canvas stretched, neither points of spears, nor golden garments making a royal pavilion; but like as if any one upon an earth much larger than this earth, yea <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, had stretched out many heavens, strange and awful would be the sight he showed; even so may one see here.</p>

<p>For in nothing are their lodging-places in a condition inferior to the heavens; for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> lodge with them, and the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. For if they came to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, a man having a wife, and bringing up children, because they saw him hospitable; when they find much more abundant <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and a man delivered from the body, and in the flesh disregarding the flesh, much more do they tarry there, and celebrate the choral feast that becomes them. For there is moreover a table among them pure from all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and full of self-denial.</p>

<p>No streams of blood are among them, nor cutting up of flesh, nor heaviness of head, nor dainty cooking, neither are there unpleasing smells of meat among them, nor disagreeable smoke, neither runnings and tumults, and disturbances, and wearisome clamors; but bread and water, the latter from a pure fountain, the former from honest labor. But if any time they should be minded to feast more sumptuously, their sumptuousness consists of fruits, and greater is the pleasure there than at royal tables. There is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> there, or trembling; no ruler accuses, no wife provokes, no child casts into sadness, no dis  orderly mirth dissipates, no multitude of flatterers puffs up; but the table is an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> table free from all such turmoil.</p>

<p>And for a couch they have grass only beneath them, like as Christ did when making a dinner in the wilderness. And many of them do this, not being even under shelter, but for a roof they have heaven, and the moon instead of the light of a candle, not wanting oil, nor one to attend to it; on them alone does it shine worthily from on high.</p>

<p>4. This table even <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> from heaven beholding are delighted and pleased. For if over one sinner that <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a> they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, over so many just men imitating them, what will they not do? There are not master and slave; all are slaves, all free men. And do not think the saying to be a dark proverb, for they are indeed slaves one of another, and masters one of another.</p>

<p>They have no occasion to be in sadness when evening has overtaken them, as many men feel, revolving the anxious thoughts that spring from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of the day. They have no occasion after their supper to be careful about <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and to shut the doors, and to put bars against them, neither to dread the other ills, of which many are afraid, extinguishing their candles with strict care, lest a spark anywhere should set the house on fire.</p>

<p>And their conversation again is full of the same calm. For they talk not of these things, whereof we discourse, that are nothing to us; such a one is made governor, such a one has ceased to be governor; such a one is dead, and another has succeeded to the inheritance, and all such like, but always about the things to come do they speak and seek wisdom; and as though dwelling in another world, as though they had migrated unto heaven itself, as living there, even so all their conversation is about the things there, about <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom, about the crowns of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, about the choiring with Christ; and of things present they have neither any memory nor thought, but like as we should not deign to speak at all of what the ants do in their holes and clefts; so neither do they of what we do; but about the King that is above, about the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in which they are engaged, about the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> crafts, about the good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have achieved.</p>

<p>Wherein therefore are we different from ants, when compared with them? For like as they care for the things of the body, so also do we; and would it were for these alone: but now it is even for things far worse. For not for necessary things only do we care like them, but also for things superfluous. For those insects pursue a business free from all blame, but we follow after all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and not even the ways of ants do we imitate, but the ways of wolves, but the ways of leopards, or rather we are even worse than these. For to them nature has assigned that they should be thus fed, but us God has <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with speech, and a sense of equity, and we have become worse than the wild beasts.</p>

<p>And whereas we are worse than the brutes, those men are equal to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, being strangers and pilgrims as to the things here; and all things in them are made different from us, clothing, and food, and house, and shoes, and speech. And if any one were to hear them conversing and us, then he would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> full well, how they indeed are citizens of heaven, but we are not worthy so much as of the earth.</p>

<p>So that therefore, when any one invested with rank has come unto them, then is all inflated <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> found utterly vain. For the laborer there, and he that has no experience of worldly affairs, sits near him that is a commander of troops, and prides himself on his authority, upon the grass, upon a mean cushion. For there are none to extol him, none to puff him up; but the same result takes place, as if any one were to go to a goldsmith, and a garden of roses, for he receives some brightness from the gold and from the roses; so they too, gaining a little from the splendor of these, are delivered from their former arrogance. And like as if any were to go upon a high place, though he be exceedingly short, he appears high; so these too, coming unto their exalted minds, appear like them, so long as they abide there, but when they are gone down are abased again, on descending from that height.</p>

<p>A king is nothing among them, a governor is nothing; but like as we, when children are playing at these things, laugh; so do they also utterly spurn the inflamed <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of them who strut without. And this is evident from hence, that if any one would give them a kingdom to possess in security, they would never take it; yet they would take it, unless their thoughts were upon what is greater than it, unless they accounted the thing to be but for a season.</p>

<p>What then? Shall we not go over unto blessedness so great? Shall we not come unto these <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; shall we not receive clean garments, and join in the ceremonies of this wedding feast; but shall we continue begging, in no respect in a better condition than the poor in the streets, or rather in a state far worse and more wretched? For much worse  than these are they that are rich in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways, and it is better to beg than to spoil, for the one has excuse, but the other brings punishment; and the beggar in no degree offends <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but this other both men and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and undergoes the labors of rapine, but all the enjoyment thereof other men often reap.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> then these things, let us lay aside all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> the things above, with great earnestness <q>taking the kingdom by force.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202616"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;11:12</a></span> For it cannot be, it cannot be that any one who is remiss should enter therein.</p>

<p>But God grant that we all having become earnest, and watchful may attain thereto, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
