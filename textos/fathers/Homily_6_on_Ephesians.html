<h1>Homily 6 on Ephesians</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse17">Chapter II. Verses 17-22</a> </p>

<p><q>And He came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were near, for through Him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father. So then you are no more strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and of the household of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the chief corner-stone. In whom each several building, fitly framed together, grows into a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple in the Lord. In whom you also are built together for a habitation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q></p>

<p>He sent not, says the Apostle, by the hand of another, nor did He announce these tidings to us by means of any other, but Himself did it in His own person. He sent not Angel nor Archangel on the mission, because to repair so many and vast mischiefs and to declare what had been wrought was in the power of none other, but required His own coming.  The Lord then took upon Himself the rank of a servant, nay, almost of a minister, <q>and came, and preached peace to you,</q> says he, <q>that were far off, and to them that were near.</q> To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, he means, who as compared with ourselves  were near. <q>For through Him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.</q></p>

<p><q>Peace,</q> says he, that <q>peace</q> which is towards God. He has reconciled us. For the Lord Himself also says, <q>Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse27">John 14:27</a></span> And again, <q>Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a></span> And again, <q>Whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse14">John 14:14</a></span> And again, <q>For the Father loves you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse27">John 16:27</a></span> These are so many evidences of peace. But how towards the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>? <q>Because through Him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> not ye less, and they more, but all by one and the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> He appeased by His death, and has made us meet for the Father's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> through the Spirit. Mark again, the <q>in</q> means <q>by</q> or <q>through.</q> By Himself and the Spirit that is, He has brought us unto the Father. <q>So then you are no more strangers and sojourners, but fellow citizens with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q></p>

<p>Perceive ye that it is not with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> simply, no, but with those saintly and great men, such as <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and Elias? It is for the self-same city with these we are enrolled, for that we declare ourselves. <q>For they that say such things,</q> says he, <q>make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse14">Hebrews 11:14</a></span> No longer are we strangers from the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, nor foreigners. For they who shall not attain to heavenly blessings, are foreigners. <q>For the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> says Christ, <q>abides for ever.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse35">John 8:35</a></span></p>

<p><q>And of the household,</q> he continues, <q>of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>The very thing which they at the first had, by means of so many toils and troubles, has been for you accomplished by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Behold the hope of your calling.</p>

<p><q>Being built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets.</q></p>

<p>Observe how he blends all together, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>,  the Apostles, the Prophets, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and illustrates the union sometimes from the body, and sometimes from the building: <q>built,</q> says he, <q>upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets;</q> that is, the Apostles and Prophets are a foundation,  and he places the Apostles first, though they are in order of time last, doubtless to represent and express this, that both the one and the other are alike a foundation, and that the whole is one building, and that there is one root. Consider, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> have the Patriarchs as a foundation. He here speaks more strongly of that point than he does when he speaks of a <q>grafting in.</q> There he rather attaches them on. Then he adds, that He who binds the whole together in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For the chief corner-stone binds together both the walls, and the foundations.</p>

<p><q>In whom each several building.</q></p>

<p>Mark, how he knits it all together, and represents Him at one time, as holding down the whole body from above, and welding it together; at another time, as supporting the building from below, and being, as it were, a root, or base. And whereas he had used the expression, <q>He created in Himself of the two one new man;</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse15">Ephesians 2:15</a></span> by this he clearly shows us, that by Himself Christ knits together the two walls: and again, that in Him it was created. And <q>He is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>,</q>  says he, <q>of all creation,</q> that is, He Himself supports all things.</p>

<p><q>In whom each several building, fitly framed together.</q></p>

<p>Whether you speak of the roof, or of the walls, or of any other part whatsoever,  He it is supports the whole. Thus he elsewhere calls Him a foundation. <q>For other foundations,</q> says he, <q>can no man lay than that which is laid, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 3:11</a></span> <q>In whom each several building,</q> he says, <q>fitly framed together.</q> Here he displays the perfectness of it, and indicates that one cannot otherwise have place in it, unless by living with great exactness. <q>It grows says he into a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, in whom you also,</q> he adds, <q>are built together.</q> He is speaking continuously: <q>Into a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple, for a habitation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q> What then is the object of this building? It is that God may dwell in this temple. For each of you severally is a temple, and all of you together are a temple. And He dwells in you as in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and as in a Spiritual temple. He does not use the word which means our coming to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03BF;&#x03B4;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) but which implies God's bringing us to Himself, (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03B1;&#x03B3;&#x03C9;&#x03B3;&#x1F75;</span>) for we came not out of ourselves, but we were brought near by Him. <q>No one,</q> says Christ, <q>comes unto the Father but by Me.</q> And again, <q>I am the way, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a></span></p>

<p>He joins them with the Saints and again returns to his former image, nowhere suffering them to be disunited from Christ. Doubtless then, this is a building that shall go on until His coming. Doubtless it was for this reason that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, <q>As a wise master builder, I laid a foundation.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 3:10-11</a></span> And again that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the foundation. What then means all this? You observe that the comparisons have all referred to the subject-matters, and that we must not expound them to the very letter. The Apostle speaks from analogy as Christ does, where He calls the Father an husbandman, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse1">John 15:1</a></span> and Himself a root. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse16">Revelation 22:16</a></span></p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse1">Chap. iii. ver. 1</a>. <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> I <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q></p>

<p>He has mentioned Christ's great and affectionate care; he now passes on to his own, insignificant indeed as it is, and a very nothing in comparison with that, and yet this is enough to engage them to himself. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, says he, am I also bound.  For if my Lord was crucified for your sakes, much more am I bound. He not only was bound Himself, but allows His servants to be bound also&mdash;<q>for you <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> It is full of emphasis; not only do we no longer loathe you, but we are even bound, says he, for your sakes and of this exceeding <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> am I partaker.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse2">Ver. 2</a>. <q>If so be that you have heard of the dispensation of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which was given me to you-ward.</q></p>

<p>He alludes to the prediction addressed to Ananias concerning him at Damascus, when the Lord said, <q>Go your way, for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name before the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> and Kings.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts 9:15</a></span></p>

<p>By <q>dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,</q> he means the revelation made to him. As much as to say, I learned it not from man. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse12">Galatians 1:12</a></span> He vouchsafed to reveal it even to me, though but an individual for your sakes. For Himself said unto me, says he, <q>Depart, for I will send you forth far hence unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse21">Acts 22:21</a></span> <q>If so be that you have heard</q> for a dispensation it was, a mighty one; to call one, uninfluenced from any other quarter, immediately from above, and to say, <q>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</q> and to strike him blind with that ineffable light! <q>if so be that you have heard,</q>  says he, <q>of the dispensation of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which was given me to you-ward.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse3">Ver. 3</a>. <q>How that by revelation was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto me the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, as I wrote afore in few words.</q></p>

<p>Perhaps he had informed them of it by some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or had not long before been writing to them.  Here he is pointing out that the whole is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we have contributed nothing. For what? I ask, was not <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself, the wonderful, he that was so versed in the law, he that was brought up at the feet of <a href="../cathen/06374b.htm">Gamaliel</a> according to the most perfect manner, was not he saved by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? With good reason too does he call this a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, for a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> it is, to raise the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in a moment to a higher rank than the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <q>As I wrote afore,</q> says he, <q>in few words,</q> i.e., briefly,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse4">Ver. 4</a>. <q>Whereby, when you read, you can perceive.</q></p>

<p>Amazing! So then he wrote not the whole, nor so much as he should have written. But here the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the subject prevented it. Elsewhere, as in the case of the Hebrews <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse11">Hebrews 5:11</a></span> and the Corinthians, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1 Corinthians 3:2</a></span> the incapacity of the hearers. <q>Whereby, when you read, you can perceive,</q> says he, <q>my understanding in the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> i.e., how I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, how I understood either such things as God has spoken, or else, that Christ sits at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and then too the dignity, in that God <q>has not dealt so with any nation.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa147.htm#verse20">Psalm 147:20</a></span> And then to explain what nation this is with whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has thus dealt, he adds,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse5">Ver. 5</a>. <q>Which in other generations was not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as it has now been revealed unto His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles and Prophets in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q></p>

<p>What then, tell me, did not the Prophets  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it? How then does Christ say, that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the Prophets wrote <q>these things concerning Me?</q> And again, <q>If you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John 5:46</a></span> And again, <q>You search the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, because ye think that in them you have <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and these are they which bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse39">John 5:39</a></span> His meaning is this, either that it was not revealed unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for he adds, <q>which in other generations was not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as it has now been revealed;</q> or else, that it was not thus made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the very facts and realities themselves, <q>as it has now been revealed unto His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostles and Prophets in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>.</q> For reflect. Peter, had he not been instructed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, never would have gone to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. For hear what he says, <q>Then has God given unto them the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, as well as unto us.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse47">Acts 10:47</a></span> That it was by the Spirit that God chose that they should receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. The Prophets then spoke, yet they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not thus perfectly; so far from it, that not even did the Apostles, after they had heard it. So far did it surpass all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> calculation, and the common expectation.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse6">Ver. 6</a>. <q>That the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body and fellow partakers.</q> </p>

<p>What is this; <q>fellow-heirs, and fellow-partakers of the promise, and fellow-members of the body?</q> This last is the great thing, that they should be one body; this exceeding closeness of relation to Him. For that they were to be called indeed, that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, but that it was so great, as yet they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not. This therefore he calls the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. <q>Of the promise.</q> The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> were partakers, and the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also were fellow-partakers of the promise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p><q>In Christ Jesus through the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q></p>

<p>That is, by His being sent unto them also, and by their believing; for it is not said they are fellow-heirs simply, but <q>through the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> However, this indeed, is nothing so great, it is in fact a small thing, and it discloses to us another and greater thing, that not only men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not this, but that neither Angels nor Archangels, nor any other created power, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it. For it was a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and was not revealed. <q>That ye can perceive,</q> he says, <q>my understanding.</q> This alludes, perhaps, to what he said to them in the Acts, that he had some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also were called. This, he says, is his own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <q>the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>,</q> which he had mentioned, viz., <q>that Christ will in Himself make of the two one new man.</q> For by revelation he was instructed, both he and Peter, that they must not spurn the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; and this he states in his defence.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse7">Ver. 7</a>. <q>Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which was given me according to the working of His power.</q></p>

<p>He had said, <q>I am a prisoner;</q> but now again he says, that all is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as he says, <q>according to the gift of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>;</q> for according to the power of the gift is the dignity of this privilege. But the gift would not have been enough, had it not also implanted in him power.</p>

<p>Moral. For a work indeed it was of power, of mighty power, and such as no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> diligence was equal to. For he brought three qualifications to the preaching of the word, a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> fervent and venturous, a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ready to undergo any possible hardship, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and wisdom combined. For his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of enterprise, his blamelessness of life, had availed nothing, had he not also received the power of the Spirit. And look at it as seen first in himself, or rather hear his own words. <q>That our ministration be not blamed.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse3">2 Corinthians 6:3</a></span> And again, <q>For our exhortation, is not of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile, nor a cloke of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse3">1 Thessalonians 2:3-5</a></span> Thus you have seen his blamelessness. And again, <q>For we take thought for things <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse21">2 Corinthians 8:21</a></span> Then again, besides these; <q>I protest by that glorying in you which I have in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, I die daily.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse31">1 Corinthians 15:31</a></span> And again; <q>Who shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ? Shall tribulation, or anguish, or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse35">Romans 8:35</a></span> And again; <q>In much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in watchings.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse4">2 Corinthians 6:4-5</a></span> Then again, his <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and management; <q>To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> I became as a Jew, to them that are without law as without law, to them that are under the law as under the law.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse20">1 Corinthians 9:20</a></span> He shaves his head also, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse24">Acts 21:24-26</a></span> and does numberless things of the sort. But the crown of all is in the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. <q>For I will not dare to speak,</q> says he, <q>of any things save those which Christ wrought through me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse18">Romans 15:18</a></span> And again, <q>For what is there wherein you were made inferior to the rest of the Churches?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse13">2 Corinthians 12:13</a></span> And again, <q>For in nothing was I behind the very chiefest Apostles though I am nothing.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse11">2 Corinthians 12:11</a></span> Without these things, the work had been impossible.</p>

<p>It was not then by his <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that men were made <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>; no, it was not the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that did this, nor was it upon the ground of these that he claimed his high pretension, but upon those other grounds. For a man must be alike irreproachable in conduct, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and discreet in his dealings with others, regardless of danger, and apt to teach. It was by these qualifications that the greater part of his success was achieved. Where there were these, there was no need of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. At least we see he was successful in numberless such cases, quite antecedently to the use of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. But, now-a-days, we without any of these would fain command all things. Yet if one of them be separated from the other, it henceforth becomes useless. What is the advantage of a man's being ever so regardless of danger, if his life be open to censure. <q>For if the light that is in you be darkness,</q> says Christ, <q>how great is that darkness?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse23">Matthew 6:23</a></span> Again, what the advantage of a man's being of an irreproachable life, if he is sluggish and indolent? <q>For, he that does not take his cross, and follow after Me,</q> says He, <q>is not worthy of Me;</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse38">Matthew 10:38</a></span> and so, <q>The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John 10:11</a></span> Again, what is the advantage of being both these, unless a man is at the same time <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and discreet in <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how he ought to answer each one?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse6">Colossians 4:6</a></span> Even if <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> be not in our power, yet both these qualities are in our power. Still however, notwithstanding <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> contributed so much from himself, yet did he attribute all to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. This is the act of a grateful servant. And we should never so much as have heard of his good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, had he not been brought to a necessity of declaring them.</p>

<p>And are we worthy then so much as even to mention the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? He, who had moreover <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to aid him, yet was not satisfied, but contributed to the work ten thousand perils; while we, who are destitute of that source of confidence, whence, tell me, do we expect either to preserve those who are committed to our charge, or to gain those who are not come to the fold&mdash;men, as we are, who have been making a study of self-indulgence, who are searching the world over for ease, and who are unable, or rather who are unwilling, to endure even the very shadow of danger, and are as far distant from his wisdom as heaven is from earth? Hence it is too that they who are under us are at so great a distance behind the men of those days; because the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of those days were better than the teachers of these, isolated as they were in the midst of the populace, and of tyrants, and having all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> on all sides their enemies, and yet not in the slightest degree dragged down or yielding. Hear at least what he says to the Philippians, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse29">Philippians 1:29</a></span> <q>Because to you it has been granted in the behalf of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, but also to suffer in his behalf.</q> And again to the Thessalonians, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse14">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a></span> <q>For you, brethren, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Jud&aelig;a.</q> And again in writing to the Hebrews <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse34">Hebrews 10:34</a></span> he said, <q>And ye took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions.</q> And to the Colossians <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse3">Colossians 3:3</a></span> he testifies, saying, <q>For you died, and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And indeed to these very Ephesians he bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of many perils and dangers. And again in writing to the Galatians, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse4">Galatians 3:4</a></span> he says, <q>Did ye suffer so many things in vain? If it be indeed in vain.</q> And you see them too, all employed in doing good. Hence it was that both <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> wrought effectually in those days, hence also that they lived in good works. Hear, moreover, what he writes to the Corinthians, against whom he brings charges out of number; yet does he not bear even them record, where he says, <q>Yea, what <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> it wrought in you, yea, what longing!</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 7:11</a></span> And again, in how many points does he bear them record on this subject? These things one shall not see now-a-days, even in teachers. They are all gone and perished. And the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is, that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has waxed cold, that sinners go unpunished; (for hear what he says writing to Timothy, <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse20">1 Timothy 5:20</a></span> <q>Them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, reprove in the sight of all;</q>) it is that the rulers are in a sickly state; for if the head be not sound, how can the rest of the body maintain its vigor? But mark how great is the present disorder. They, who were living virtuously, and who under any circumstance might have confidence, have taken possession of the tops of the mountains,  and have escaped out of the world, separating themselves as from an enemy and an alien and not from a body to which they belonged.</p>

<p>Plagues too, teeming with untold mischiefs, have lighted upon the Churches. The chief offices have become saleable.  Hence numberless <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> are springing, and there is no one to redress, no one to reprove them. Nay, the disorder has assumed a sort of method and consistency. Has a man done wrong, and been arraigned for it? His effort is not to prove himself guiltless, but to find if possible accomplices in his crimes. What is to become of us? Since <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> is our threatened portion. Believe me, had not God stored up punishment for us there, you would see every day tragedies deeper than the disasters of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. What then? However let no one take offense, for I mention no names; suppose some one were to come into this church to present you that are here at this moment, those that are now with me, and to make inquisition of them; or rather not now, but suppose on <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> day any one, endued with such a spirit, as to have a thorough <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the things they had been doing, should narrowly examine all that came to Communion, and were being washed [in Baptism] after they had attended the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; many things would be discovered more shocking than the Jewish horrors. He would find <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who practise augury, who make use of charms, and omens and incantations, and who have committed fornication, adulterers, drunkards, and revilers,&mdash; <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, I am unwilling to add, lest I should hurt the feelings of any of those who are standing here. What more? Suppose any one should make scrutiny into all the communicants in the world, what kind of transgression is there which he would not detect? And what if he examined those in authority? Would he not find them eagerly bent upon gain? Making traffic of high places? <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, malignant, vainglorious, gluttonous, and slaves to money?</p>

<p>Where then there is such impiety as this going on, what dreadful calamity must we not expect? And to be assured how sore vengeance they incur who are guilty of such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as these, consider the examples of old. One single man, a common soldier, stole the sacred property, and all were smitten. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, doubtless, the history I mean? I am speaking of Acham the son of Carmi, the man who stole the <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> spoil. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jos007.htm#verse1">Joshua 7:1-26</a></span> The time too when the Prophet spoke, was a time when their country was full of soothsayers, like that of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse6">Isaiah 2:6</a></span> Whereas now there are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> out of number at the full, and not one fears. Oh, henceforth let us take the alarm. God is accustomed to punish the righteous also with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; such was the case with Daniel, and with the three <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Children, such has been the case with ten thousand others, such is the case in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> that are taking place even at the present day. For the one indeed, whatever burden of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they have upon them, by this means lay aside even that; but not so the other.</p>

<p>On account of all these things, let us take heed to ourselves. Do ye not see these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>? Do ye not hear of these disasters? Do ye learn no lesson from these things? Nations and whole cities are swallowed up and destroyed, and myriads as many again are enslaved to the barbarians.</p>

<p>If <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> bring us not to our senses, yet let these things. What, are these too mere threats, are they not facts that have already taken place? Great is the punishment they have suffered, yet a greater still shall we suffer, who are not brought to our senses even by their <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>. Is this discourse wearing?  I am aware it is myself, but if we attend to it, it has its advantage; because this it has not, the quality of an address to please&mdash;nay more, nor ever shall have, but ever those topics which may avail to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and to chasten the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For these will be to us the ground-work of those blessings to come hereafter, to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant that we may all attain, in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, with whom to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now and henceforth, and forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
