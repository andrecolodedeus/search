<h1>Homily 6 on First Timothy</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse1">1 Timothy 2:1-4</a></strong></p>

<p> <em><q>I exhort therefore that, first of all, supplications, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; for kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved, and to come unto the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> [R.V.: who wills that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be saved, etc.]</em></p>

<p>The Priest is the common father, as it were, of all the world; it is proper therefore that he should care for all, even as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Whom he serves.  For this reason he says, <q>I exhort therefore that, first of all, supplications, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> From this, two advantages result. First, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards those who are without is done away; for no one can feel <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards those for whom he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>: and they again are made better by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that are offered for them, and by losing their ferocious disposition towards us. For nothing is so apt to draw men under teaching, as to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and be loved. Think what it was for those who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, scourged, banished, and slaughtered the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to hear that those whom they treated so barbarously offered fervent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to God for them.  Observe how he wishes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to be superior to all ill-treatment. As a father who was struck on the face by a little child which he was carrying, would not lose anything of his affection for it; so we ought not to abate in our good will towards those who are without, even when we are stricken by them. What is <q>first of all</q>? It means in the daily Service; and the initiated <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how this is done every day both in the evening and the morning, how we offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the whole world, for kings and all that are in authority. But some one perhaps will say, he meant not for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but for all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. How then does he speak of kings? For kings were not then worshipers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for there was a long succession of ungodly princes. And that he might not seem to flatter them, he says first, <q>for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> then <q>for kings</q>; for if he had only mentioned kings, that might have been suspected. And then since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> might be slow  at hearing this, and reject the exhortation, if at the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mysteries it was necessary to offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> king, he shows them the advantage of it, thus at least to reconcile them to the advice, <q>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life</q>; as much as to say, Their safety is a security to us;  as also in his Epistle to the Romans, he exhorts them to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their rulers, <q>not for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> but for <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>' sake.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse5">Romans 13:5</a></span> For God has appointed government for the public good. When therefore they make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for this end, and stand on guard for our security, were it not unreasonable that we should not offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for their safety in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and dangers? It is not therefore flattery, but agreeable to the rules of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For if they were not preserved, and prospered in their <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, our affairs must necessarily be involved in confusion and trouble; and if they were cut off, we must either serve ourselves, or be scattered up and down as fugitives. For they are a sort of bulwarks  thrown up before us, within which those who are inclosed are in peace and safety.</p>

<p>He says, <q>supplications, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, intercessions, and giving of thanks.</q> For we must give thanks to God for the good that befalls others, as that He makes the sun to shine upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good, and sends His rain both upon the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Observe how he would unite and bind us together, not only by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> but by thanksgiving. For he who is urged to thank God for his neighbor's good, is also bound to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him, and be kindly disposed towards him. And if we must give thanks for our neighbor's good, much more for what happens to ourselves, and for what is unknown, and even for things against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and such as appear grievous to us, since God dispenses all things for our good.</p>

<p> <em>Moral</em>. Let every <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of ours, then, be accompanied with thanksgiving. And if we are commanded to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for our neighbors, not only for the faithful, but for the unbelieving also, consider how wrong it is to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> against your brethren. What? Has He commanded you to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for your enemies, and do you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> against your brother? But your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not against him, but against yourself. For you provoke God by uttering those impious words, <q>Show him the same!</q> <q>So do to him!</q> <q>Smite him!</q> <q>Recompense him!</q> Far be such words from the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who should be meek and mild. From the mouth that has been vouchsafed such <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Mysteries, let nothing bitter proceed.  Let not the tongue that has touched the Lord's Body utter anything offensive, let it be kept pure, let not curses be borne upon it. For if <q>revilers shall not inherit the kingdom of God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 6:10</a></span>, much less those who curse. For he that curses must be injurious; and injuriousness and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> are at variance with each other, cursing and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> are far apart, accusation and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> are wide asunder. Do you propitiate God with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and then utter imprecations? If you forgive not, you will not be forgiven. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse15">Matthew 6:15</a></span> But instead of forgiving, you beseech God not to forgive; what excessive <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in this! If the unforgiving is not forgiven, he that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> his Lord not to forgive, how shall he be forgiven? The harm is to yourself, not him. For though your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were on the point of being heard for yourself, they would never be accepted in such a case, as offered with a polluted mouth. For surely the mouth that curses is polluted with all that is offensive and unclean.</p>

<p>When you ought to tremble for your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, to wrestle earnestly for the pardon of them, you come to move God against your brother&mdash; do you not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, nor think of what concerns yourself? Do you not see what you are doing? Imitate even the conduct of children at school. If they see their own class within giving account of their lessons, and all beaten for their idleness, and one by one severely examined and chastised with blows, they are frightened to death, and if one of their companions strikes them, and that severely, they cannot have while to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, nor complain to their master; so is their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> possessed with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. They only look to one thing, that they may go in and come out without stripes, and their thoughts are on that time. And when they come out, whether beaten or not, the blows they have received from their playmates never enter their minds for the delight. And you, when you stand anxiously concerned for your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, how can you but shudder at making mention of others' faults?  How can you implore pardon of God? For your own case is made worse on the terms of your imprecations against another, and you forbid Him to make allowance for your own faults. Might He not say, <q>If you would have Me so severe in exacting offenses against you, how can you expect Me to pardon your offenses against Me?</q> Let us learn at last to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>! If we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, which is a very simple and easy thing, what else shall we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? Let us learn to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> like <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Those are the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the supplications of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian's</a> are the reverse, for the forgiveness and forgetting of offenses against us. <q>Being reviled,</q> it is said, <q>we bless; being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, we suffer it; being defamed, we entreat.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse12">1 Corinthians 4:12-13</a></span> Hear Stephen saying, <q>Lord, lay not this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse60">Acts 6:60</a></span> Instead of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> against them, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them. You, instead of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for them, utter imprecations against them. You then are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in the degree that he was excellent. Whom do we admire, tell me; those for whom he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, or him who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them? Him certainly! And if we, much more then God. Would you have your enemy stricken? <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for him: yet not with such intention, not to strike him. That will indeed be the effect, but let it not be your object. That blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> suffered all <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, yet he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them: we suffer many things <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> from our enemies. And if he who suffered <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> dared not forbear to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for his enemies, what punishment do we deserve, who suffer <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and yet do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them, nay, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> against them? You think indeed that you are inflicting a blow upon another, but in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> you are thrusting  the sword against yourself. You allow not the Judge to be lenient to your own offenses, by this way of urging Him to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against others. For, <q>with what measure you mete,</q> He says, <q>it shall be measured to you again; and with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse2">Matthew 7:2</a></span> Let us therefore be disposed to pardon, that God may be so disposed towards us.</p>

<p>These things I wish you not only to hear, but to observe. For now the memory retains only the words, and perhaps hardly those. And after we are separated, if any one who was not present were to ask you, what had been our discourse, some could not tell: others would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> merely the subject we had spoken of, and answer that there had been a Homily upon the subject of forgiving injuries, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for our enemies, but would omit all that had been said, as they could not remember: others remember a little, but still somewhat. If therefore you gain nothing by what you hear, I entreat you not even to attend at the discourse. For of what use is it? The condemnation is greater, the punishment more severe, if after so many exhortations, we continue in the same course. For this reason God has given us a definite form of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that we might ask for nothing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, nothing worldly. And you that are faithful <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what you ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, how the whole Prayer is common. But one says, <q>It is not commanded there to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for unbelievers.</q> This you would not say, if you understood the force, the depth, the hidden treasure of that  Prayer. Only unfold it, and you find this also comprised within it. For it is implied, when one says in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Your will be done on earth, as it is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> Now, because in heaven there is no unbeliever nor offender; if therefore it was for the faithful alone, there would be no reason in that expression. If the faithful were to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the unbelievers not to do it, His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> were not done in earth as it is in heaven. But it means; As there is none <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in heaven, so let there be none on earth; but draw all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of You, make all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, even those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, and are our enemies. Do you not see how God is daily <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> and mocked by <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> and unbelievers, both in word and in deed? What then? Has He for this extinguished the sun? Or stayed the course of the moon? Has He crushed the heavens and uprooted the earth? Has He dried up the sea? Has He shut up the fountains of waters? Or confounded the air? Nay, on the contrary, He makes His sun to rise, His rain to descend, gives the fruits of the earth in their seasons, and thus supplies yearly nourishment to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, to the insensible, to the polluted, to persecutors; not for one day or two, but for their whole life. Imitate Him then, emulate Him as far as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> powers admit. Can you not make the sun arise? Abstain from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking. Can you not send rain? Forbear reviling. Can you not give food? Refrain from insolence. Such gifts from you are sufficient. The goodness of God to His enemies is shown by His works. Do thou so at least by words: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for your enemies, so will you be like your Father who is in heaven. How many times have we discoursed upon this subject! nor shall we cease to discourse; only let something come of it. It is not that we are drowsy, and weary of speaking; only do not you that hear be annoyed. Now a person seems to be annoyed, when he will not do what one says. For he who practices, loves often to hear the same thing, and is not annoyed by it; for it is his own commendation. But annoyance arises simply from not doing what is prescribed. Hence the speaker is troublesome. If a man practices almsgiving, and hears another speak of almsgiving, he is not wearied,  but pleased, for he hears his own good actions recommended and proclaimed. So that when we are displeased at hearing a discourse upon the forgiveness of injuries, it is because we have no interest in forbearance, it is not practiced by us; for if we had the reality, we should not be pained at its being named. If therefore you would not have us wearisome or annoying, practice as we preach, exhibit in your actions the subject of our discourses. For we shall never cease discoursing upon these things till your conduct is agreeable to them. And this we do more especially from our concern and affection for you. For the trumpeter must sound his trumpet, though no one should go out to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>; he must fulfill his part. We do it, not as wishing to bring heavier condemnation upon you, but to avert it from ourselves. And besides this, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for you constrains us, for it would tear and torture our hearts if that should befall you, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> avert! It is not any costly process that we recommend to you: it does not require the spoiling of goods, nor a long and toilsome journey. It is only to will. It is a word, it is a purpose of the mind. Let us only set a guard on our tongues, a door and a bar upon our lips, that we may utter nothing offensive to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is for our own advantage, not for theirs for whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, to act thus. For let us ever consider, that he who blesses his enemy, blesses himself, he who curses his enemy, curses himself, and he who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for his enemy, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> not for him, but for himself. If we thus act, we shall be able to reduce to practice this excellent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>,  and so to obtain the promised blessings, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</p>
