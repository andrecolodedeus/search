<h1>Homily 6 on the First Epistle of John</h1>

<h2>1 John 3:19-4:3</h2>

<p><q>And herein we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and assure our hearts before Him. For if our heart think ill of us, God is greater than our heart, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things. Beloved, if our heart think not ill of us, then have we confidence toward God. And whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do in His sight those things that please Him. And this is His commandment, That we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the name of His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, as He gave us commandment. And he that keeps His commandments shall dwell in Him, and He in him. And herein we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He abides in us, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which He has given us. Dearly beloved, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> are gone out into this world. In this is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>: every spirit that confesses that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh is of God: and every spirit that confesses not that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh is not of God: and this is the antichrist, of whom you have heard that he should come; and even now already is he in this world.</q></p>

<p>1. If ye remember, brethren, yesterday we closed our sermon at this sentence, <span class="stiki" id="note172285"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:18-20</a></span> which without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> behooved and does behoove to abide in your heart, seeing it was the last ye heard. <q>My little children, let us not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> only in word and in tongue; but in deed and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> Then he goes on: <q>And herein we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and assure our hearts before Him.</q>  <q>For if our heart  think ill of us, God is greater than our heart, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things.</q> He had said, <q>Let us not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> only in word and in tongue, but in work and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>:</q> we are asked, In what work, or in what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that loves <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or loves his brother? Above he had said up to what point charity is perfected: what the Lord says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than this has no man, that one lay down his life for his friends,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172288"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;15:13</a></span> this same had the apostle also said: <q>As He laid down His life for us, we ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172289"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:16</a></span> This is the perfection of charity, and greater can not at all be found. But because it is not perfect in all, and that man ought not to despair in whom it is not perfect, if that be already born which may be perfected: and of course if born, it must be nourished, and by certain nourishments of its own must be brought unto its proper perfection: therefore, we have asked concerning the commencement of charity, where it begins, and there have straightway found: <q>But whoso has this world's goods, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father in him?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172290"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:17</a></span> Here then has this charity, my brethren, its beginning: to give of one's superfluities to him that has need to him that is in any distress; of one's temporal abundance to deliver his brother from temporal tribulation. Here is the first rise of charity. This, being thus begun, if you shall nourish with the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and hope of the life to come, you will come at last unto that perfection, that you shall be ready to lay down your life for your brethren.</p>

<p>2. But, because many such things are done by men who seek other objects, and who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the brethren; let us come back to the tes timony of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. How do we prove that many such things are done by men who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the brethren? How many in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms call themselves <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>! They seem to themselves to lay down their lives for their brethren. If for the brethren they laid down their lives, they would not separate themselves from the whole brotherhood. Again, how many there are who for the sake of vainglory bestow much, give much, and seek therein but the praise of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and popular <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which is full of windiness, and possesses no stability! Seeing, then, there are such, where shall be the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of brotherly charity? Seeing he wished it to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and has said by way of admonition, <q>My little children, let us not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> only in word and in tongue; but in deed and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q> we ask, in what work, in what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Can there be a more manifest work than to give to the poor? Many do this of vainglory, not of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Can there be a greater work than to die for the brethren? This also, many would fain be thought to do, who do it of vainglory to get a name, not from bowels of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. It remains, that that man loves his brother, who before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where God alone sees, assures his own heart, and questions his heart whether he does this indeed for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the brethren; and his <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is that eye which penetrates the heart, where man cannot look. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the Apostle, because he was ready to die for the brethren, and said, <q>I will myself be spent for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172291"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:15</a></span> yet, because God only saw this in his heart, not the mortal men to whom he spoke, he says to them, <q>But to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you or at man's bar.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172292"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> And the same apostle shows also in a certain place, that these things are oft done of empty vainglory, not upon the solid ground of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>: for speaking of the praises of charity he says, <q>If I distribute all my goods to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not charity, it profits me nothing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172293"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> Is it possible for a man to do this without charity? It is. For they that have divided unity, are <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that have not charity. Seek there, and you shall see many giving much to the poor; shall see others prepared to welcome death, insomuch that where there is no persecutor they cast themselves headlong: these doubtless without charity do this. Let us come back then to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, of which the apostle says: <q>For our glorying is this, the testimony of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172294"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:12</a></span> Let us come back to <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, of which the same says, <q>But let each prove his own work, and then he shall have glorying in himself and not in another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172295"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;6:4</a></span> Therefore, let each one of us <q>prove his own work,</q> whether it flow forth from the vein of charity, whether it be from charity as the root that his good works sprout forth as branches. <q>But let each prove his own work, and then he shall have glorying in himself and not in another,</q> not when another's tongue bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to him, but when his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bears it.</p>

<p>3. This it is then that he enforces here. <q>In this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when in deed and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q> we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <q>not only in words and in tongue: and  assure our heart before Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172297"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:19</a></span> What means, <q>before Him?</q> Where He sees. Whence the Lord Himself in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> says: <q>Take heed that you do not your righteousness before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward with your Father which is in heaven.</q>  And what means, <q>Let not your left hand <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what your right hand does:</q> except that the right hand means a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the left hand the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world?  Many through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world do many wonderful things: the left hand works, not the right. The right hand ought to work, and without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the left hand, so that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the world may not even mix itself therewith when by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we work anything that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And where do we get to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this? You are before God: question your heart, see what you have done, and what therein was your aim; your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, or the windy praise of men. Look within, for man cannot judge whom he cannot see. If <q>we assure our heart,</q> let it be <q>before Him.</q> Because <q>if our heart think ill of us,</q> <em>i.e.</em> accuse us within, that we do not the thing with that mind it ought to be done withal, <q>greater is God than our heart, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things.</q> Thou hidest your heart from man: hide it from God if you can. How shall you hide it from Him, to whom it is said by a sinner, fearing and confessing, <q>Whither shall I go from Your Spirit? And from Your face whither shall I flee?</q>  He sought a way to flee, to escape the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and found none. For where is God not? <q>If I shall ascend,</q> says he, <q>into heaven, You are there: if I shall descend into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, You are there.</q> Whither will you go? Whither will you flee? Will you hear counsel? If you would flee from Him, flee to Him. Flee to Him by confessing, not from Him by hiding: hide you can not, but confess you can. Say unto Him, <q>You are my place to flee unto;</q>  and let <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> be nourished in you, which alone leads unto life. Let your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> bear you <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If it be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do not wish to display it before men; because neither men's praises lift you unto heaven, nor their censures put you down from thence. Let Him see, who crowns you: be He your <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, by whom as judge you are crowned. <q>Greater is God than our heart, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things.</q></p>

<p>4. <q>Beloved, if our heart think not ill of us, we have confidence towards God:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172302"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:21</a></span> &mdash; What means, <q>If our heart think not ill</q>? If it make <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> answer to us, that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and that there is  genuine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in us: not feigned but sincere; seeking a brother's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, expecting no emolument from a brother, but only his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash; <q>we have confidence toward God: and whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him, because we keep His commandments.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172304"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:21-22</a></span> &mdash; Therefore, not in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but where God Himself sees, in the heart&mdash; <q>we have confidence,</q> then, <q>towards God: and whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him:</q> howbeit, because we keep His commandments. What are <q>His commandments</q>? Must we be always repeating? <q>A new commandment give I unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172305"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34</a></span> It is charity itself that he speaks of, it is this that he enforces. Whoso then shall have brotherly charity, and have it before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where God sees, and his heart being interrogated under righteous examination make him none other answer than that the genuine root of charity is there for good fruits to come from; that man has confidence with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and whatsoever he shall ask, he shall receive of Him, because he keeps His commandments.</p>

<p>5. Here a question meets us: for it is not this or that man, or you or I that come in question&mdash;for if I have asked any thing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and receive it not, any person may easily say of me, <q>He has not charity:</q> and of any man soever of this present time, this may easily be said; and let any think what he will, a man of man:&mdash; not we, but those come more in question, those men of whom it is on all hands <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that they were <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> when they wrote, and that they are now with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Where is the man that has charity, if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had it not, who said, <q>Our mouth is open unto you, O you Corinthians, our heart is enlarged; you are not straitened in us:</q>  who said, <q>I will myself be spent for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>:</q> and so great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was in him, that it was manifested that he had charity. And yet we find that he asked and did not receive. What say we, brethren? It is a question: look attentively to God: it is a great question, this also. Just as, where it was said of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <q>He that is born of God <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not:</q> we found this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to be the violating of charity, and that this was the thing strictly intended in that place: so too we ask now what it is that he would say. For if you look but to the words, it seems plain: if you take the examples into the account, it is obscure. Than the words here nothing can be plainer. <q>And whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight.</q> <q>Whatsoever we ask,</q> says he, <q>we shall receive of Him.</q> He has put us sorely to straits. In the other place also he would put us to straits, if he meant all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: but then we found room to expound it in this, that he meant it of a certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; howbeit of a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which <q>whosoever is born of God commits not:</q> and we found that this same <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is none other than the violation of charity. We have also a manifest example from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, when the Lord says, <q>If I had not come, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172307"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;15:22</a></span> How? Were the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> innocent when He came to them, because He so speaks? Then if He had not come, would they have had no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Then did the Physician's presence make one sick, not take away the fever? What madman even would say this? He came not but to cure and heal the sick. Therefore when He said, <q>If I had not come, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> what would He have to be understood, but a certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in particular? For there was a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> would not have had. What <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? That they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not on Him, that when he had come they despised Him. As then He there said <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> and it does not follow that we are to understand all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but a certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: so here also not all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, lest it be contrary to that place where he says, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172308"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> but a certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in particular, that is, the violation of charity. But in this place he has bound us more tightly: <q>If we shall ask,</q> he has said, <q>if our heart accuse us not, and tell us in answer, in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is in us;</q> <q>Whatsoever we ask, we shall receive of Him.</q></p> 

<p>6. Well now: I have already told you, my, beloved brethren, let no man turn toward us. For what are we? Or what are you? What, but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all? And, if it please Him, in that Church are we; and those of us who by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> abide in it, there let us persevere, if we would show the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we have. But then the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> are we to think of him? He not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brethren! He not have within himself the testimony of his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> in the sight of God! <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> not have within him that root of charity whence all good fruits proceeded! What madman would say this? Well then: where find we that the apostle asked and did not receive? He says himself: <q>Lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to buffet me. For which thing I besought the Lord thrice, that He would take it from me. And He said unto me, My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you: for strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172309"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7-9</a></span> Lo, he was not heard in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that the <q><a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a></q> should be taken from him. But wherefore? Because it was not good for him. He was heard, then, for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when he was not heard according to his wish. Know, my beloved, a great  <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>: which we urge upon your consideration on purpose that it may not slip from you in your <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are in all things heard unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: they are always heard in that which respects their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; it is this that they desire: because in regard of this, their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are always heard.</p>

<p>7. But let us distinguish God's different ways of hearing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For we find some not heard for their wish, heard for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>: and again some we find heard for their wish, not heard for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Mark this difference, hold fast this example of a man not heard for his wish but heard for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Hear the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; for what is the hearing of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself showed him: <q>Sufficient for you,</q> says He, <q>is my <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; for strength is perfected in weakness.</q> You have besought, hast cried, hast thrice cried: the very cry you raised once for all I heard, I turned not away my ears from you; I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I should do: you would have it taken away, the healing thing by which you are burned; I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the infirmity by which you are burdened. Well then: here is a man who was heard for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, while as to his will he was not heard. Where find we <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> heard for their will, not heard for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Do we find, think we, some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, some impious man, heard of God for his will, not heard for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? If I put to you the instance of some man, perchance you will say to me, <q>It is you that callest him <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, for he was righteous; had he not been righteous, his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> would not have been heard by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> The instance I am about to allege is of one, of whose iniquity and impiety none can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself: he asked for Job, and received. <span class="stiki" id="note172311"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse11">Job&nbsp;1:11-12</a></span> Have ye not here also heard concerning the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that <q>he that commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a></q>?  Not that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> created, but that the sinner imitates. Is it not said of him, <q>He stood not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q>? <span class="stiki" id="note172313"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse44">John&nbsp;8:44</a></span> Is not even he <q>that old serpent,</q> who, through the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> pledged the first man in the drink of poison? <span class="stiki" id="note172314"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;3:1-6</a></span> Who even in the case of Job, kept for him his wife, that by her the husband might be, not comforted, but tempted? The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> asked for a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, to tempt him; and he received: the apostle asked that the thorn in the flesh might be taken from him, and he received not. But the apostle was more heard than the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For the apostle was heard for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, though not for his wish: the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> was heard for his wish, but for damnation. For that Job was yielded up to him to be tempted, was in order that by his standing the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> should be tormented. But this, my brethren, we find not only in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> books, but also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> besought the Lord, when He expelled them from the man, that they might be permitted to go into the swine. Should the Lord not have power to tell them not to approach even those creatures? For, had it not been His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to permit this, they were not about to rebel against the King of heaven and earth. But with a view to a certain <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, with a certain  ulterior meaning, He let the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> go into the swine: to show that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has dominion in them that lead the life of swine.  Demons then were heard in their request; was the apostle not heard? Or rather (what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a>) shall we say, The apostle was heard, the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> not heard? Their will was effected; his good was perfected.</p>

<p>8. Agreeably with this, we ought to understand that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though He give not to our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, does give for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For sup pose the thing you have asked be to your hurt, and the Physician <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it is to your hurt; what then? It is not to be said that the physician does not give ear to you, when, perhaps, you ask for cold water, and if it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for you, he gives it immediately, if not good, he gives it not. Had he no ears for your request, or rather, did he give ear for your good, even when he gainsaid your will? Then let there be in you charity, my brethren; let it be in you, and then set your minds at rest: even when the thing ye ask for is not given you, your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is granted, only, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not. Many have been given into their own hands, to their own hurt: of whom the apostle says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave them up to their own hearts' <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172317"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;1:24</a></span> Some man has asked for a great sum of money; he has received, to his hurt. When he had it not, he had little to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; no sooner did he come to have it, than he became a prey to the more powerful. Was not that man's request granted to his own hurt, who would needs have that for which he should be sought after by the robber, whereas, being poor, none sought after him? Learn to beseech God that you may commit it to the Physician to do what He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> best. Confess the disease, let Him apply the means of healing. Only hold fast charity. For He will needs cut, will needs burn; what if you cry out, and art not spared for your crying under the cutting, under the burning and the tribulation, yet He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how far the rottenness reaches.  You would have Him even now take off His hands, and He considers only the deepness of the sore; He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how far to go. He does not attend to you for your will, but he does attend to you for your healing. Be sure, then, my brethren, that what the apostle says is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: <q>For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered: for He makes intercession for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172319"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;8:26-27</a></span> How is it said, <q>The Spirit itself intercedes for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>,</q> but as meaning the charity which is wrought in you by the Spirit? For therefore says the same apostle: <q>The charity of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which is given unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172320"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> It is charity that groans, it is charity that <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>: against it He who gave it cannot shut His ears. Set your minds at rest: let charity ask, and the ears of God are there. Not that which you wish is done, but that is done which is advantageous. Therefore, <q>whatever we ask,</q> says he, <q>we shall receive of Him,</q> I have already said, If you understand it to mean, <q>for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,</q> there is no question: if not for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, there is a question, and a great one, a question that makes you an accuser of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. <q>Whatever we ask, we receive of Him, because we keep His commandments, and do these things that are pleasing in His sight:</q> within, where He sees.</p>

<p>9. And what are those commandments? <q>This,</q> says he, <q>is His commandment, That we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the name of His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172321"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:23</a></span> You see that this is the commandment: ye see that whoso does anything against this commandment, does the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> from which <q>every one that is born of God</q> is free. <q>As He gave us commandment:</q> that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another. <q>And he that keeps His commandment</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172322"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:24</a></span> &mdash; ye see that none other thing is bidden us than that we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another&mdash; <q>And he that keeps His commandment shall abide  in Him, and He in him.</q> And in this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He abides in us, by the Spirit which He has given us. Is it not manifest that this is what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> works in man, that there should be in him <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and charity? Is it not manifest, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, that <q>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given us</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note172324"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> For [our apostle] was speaking of charity, and was saying that we ought in the sight of God to interrogate our own heart. <q>But if our heart think not ill of us:</q> <em>i.e.</em> if it confess that from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our brother is done in us whatever is done in any good work. And then besides, in speaking of the commandment, he says this: <q>This is His commandment, That we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the name of His Son <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, as He gave us commandment.</q> <q>And he that does His commandment abides  in Him, and He in him. In this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He abides in us, by the Spirit which He has given us.</q>  If in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> you find that you have charity, you have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> in order to understand: for a very necessary thing it is.</p>

<p>10. In the earliest times, <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> fell upon them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: and they spoke with tongues,</q> which they had not learned, <q>as the Spirit gave them utterance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172327"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;2:4</a></span> These were signs adapted to the time. For there behooved to be that betokening of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in all tongues, to show that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of God was to run through all tongues over the whole earth. That thing was done for a betokening, and it passed away. In the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> now, that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, do we look that they should speak with tongues? Or when we laid the hand on these infants,  did each one of you look to see whether they would speak with tongues, and, when he saw that they did not speak with tongues, was any of you so wrong-minded as to say, These have not received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; for, had they received, they would speak with tongues as was the case in those times? If then the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the presence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be not now given through these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, by what is it given, by what does one get to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? Let him question his own heart. If he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his brother the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwells in him. Let him see, let him prove himself before the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let him see whether there be in him the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of peace and unity, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that is spread over the whole earth. Let him not rest only in his loving the brother whom he has before his eyes, for we have many brethren whom we do not see, and in the unity of the Spirit we are joined to them. What marvel that they are not with us? We are in one body, we have one Head, in heaven. Brethren, our two eyes do not see each other; as one may say, they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> each other. But in the charity of the bodily frame do they not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> each other? For, to show you that in the charity which knits them together they do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> each other; when both eyes are open, the right may not rest on some object, on which the left shall not rest likewise. Direct the glance of the right eye without the other, if you can. Together they meet in one object, together they are directed to one object: their aim is one, their places diverse. If then all who with you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God have one aim with you, heed not that in the body you are separated in place; the eyesight of the heart you have alike fixed on the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Then if you would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you have received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, question your heart: lest haply you have the sacrament, and have not the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the sacrament. Question your heart. If <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of your brethren be there, set your mind at rest. There cannot be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>: since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> cries, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in your hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which is given unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172329"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> </p>

<p>11. <q>Beloved, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not every spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172330"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:1</a></span> Because he had said, <q>In this we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He abides in us, by the Spirit which He has given us.</q> But how this same Spirit is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, mark this: <q>Beloved, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> And who is he that proves the spirits? A hard matter has he put to us, my brethren! It is well for us that he should tell us himself how we are to discern them. He is about to tell us: <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> not: but first see; mark: see that hereby is expressed the very thing that vain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>  taunt us withal. Mark, see what he says, <q>Beloved, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not every spirit, but prove the spirits whether they be from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is spoken of in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> by the name of water; where the Lord <q>cried and said, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172332"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37-39</a></span> But the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> has expounded of what He said this: for he goes on to say, <q>But this spoke He of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which they that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him should receive.</q> Wherefore did not the Lord <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> many? But what says he? <q>For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not yet given; because that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> Then seeing those had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and had not yet received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whom on the day of Pentecost the Lord sent from heaven, the glorifying of the Lord was first waited for, so that the Spirit might be given. Even before He was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and before He sent the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, He yet invited men to prepare themselves for the receiving of the water of which He said, <q>Whoso thirsts, let him come and drink;</q> and, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</q> What means, <q>Rivers of living water</q>? What is that water? Let no man ask me; ask the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>But this,</q> says it, <q>He said of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which they should receive that should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.</q> Consequently, the water of the sacrament is one thing: another, the water which betokens the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. The water of the sacrament is visible: the water of the Spirit invisible. <em>That</em> washes the body, and betokens that which is done in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. By <em>this</em> Spirit the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself is cleansed and fed. This is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and all that cut themselves off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, cannot have. And whosoever do not openly cut themselves off, but by iniquity are cut off, and being within, whirl about as chaff and are not grain; these have not this Spirit. This Spirit is denoted by the Lord under the name of water: and we have heard from this epistle, <q>Believe not every spirit;</q> and those words of Solomon bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <q>From strange water keep far.</q>  What means, <q>water</q>? Spirit. Does water always signify spirit? Not always: but in some places it signifies the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in some places it signifies <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in some places signifies peoples, <span class="stiki" id="note172334"><a href="../bible/rev017.htm#verse15">Revelation&nbsp;17:15</a></span> in some places signifies counsel: thus you find it said in a certain place, <q>Counsel is a fountain of life to them that possess it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172335"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;16:22</a></span> So then, in various places of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, the term <q>water</q> signifies various things. Now however by the term water you have heard the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> spoken of, not by an interpretation of ours but by <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, where it says, <q>But this said He of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, which they should receive that should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him.</q> If then by the name of water is signified the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and this epistle says to us, <q>Believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> let us understand that of this it is said, <q>From strange water keep far, and from a strange fountain drink not.</q>  What means, <q>From a strange fountain drink not</q>? A strange spirit <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not.</p>

<p>12. There remains then the test by which it is to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. He has indeed set down a sign, and this, belike, difficult: let us see, however. We are to recur to that charity; it is that which teaches us, because it is the unction. However, what says he here? <q>Prove the spirits, whether they be from God: because many <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> have gone out into this world.</q> Now there are all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and all schismatics. How then am I to prove the spirit? He goes on: <q>In this is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>  the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</q> Wake up the ears of your heart. We were at a loss; we were saying, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>? Who discerns? Behold, he is about to tell the sign. <q>Hereby is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>: every spirit that confesses that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh is of God: and every spirit that confesses not that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh is not of God: and this is the antichrist, of whom you have heard that he should come; and even now already is he in this world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172338"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:2-3</a></span> Our ears, so to say, are on the alert for discerning of the spirits; and we have been told something, such that thereby we discern not a whit the more. For what says he? <q>Every spirit that confesses that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh, is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Then is the spirit that is among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, seeing they <q>confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh</q>? Aye, here perchance they lift themselves up against us, and say: You have not the Spirit from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but we confess <q>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh:</q> but the apostle here has said that those have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, who confess not <q>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh.</q> Ask the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>: they confess <q>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh:</q> ask the Eunomians; they confess <q>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh:</q> ask the Macedonians; they confess <q>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh:</q> put the question to the Cataphryges; they confess <q>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh:</q> put it to the Novatians; they confess <q>that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> came in the flesh.</q> Then have all these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>? Are they then no <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>? Is there then no deception there, no seduction there? Assuredly they are antichrists; for <q>they went out from us, but were not of us.</q></p>

<p>13. What are we to do then? By what to discern them? Be very attentive; let us go together in heart, and knock. Charity herself keeps watch; for it is none other than she that shall knock, she also that shall open: anon you shall understand in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Already you have heard that it was said above, <q>Whoso denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh, the same is an antichrist.</q> There also we asked, Who denies? Because neither do we deny, nor do those deny. And we found that some do in their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> deny;  and we brought testimony from the apostle, who says, <q>For they confess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> deny Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172340"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse16">Titus&nbsp;1:16</a></span> Thus then let us now also make the enquiry in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> not in the tongue. What is the spirit that is not from God? That <q>which denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh.</q> And what is the spirit that is from God? That <q>which confesses that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh.</q> Who is he that confesses that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh? Now, brethren, to the mark! let us look to the works, not stop at the noise of the tongue. Let us ask <em>why</em> Christ came in the flesh, so we get at the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who deny that He has come in the flesh. If you stop at tongues, why, you shall hear many a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> confessing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has come in the flesh: but the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> convicts those men. Wherefore came Christ in the flesh? Was He not God? Is it not written of Him, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172341"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> Was it not He that did feed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, is it not He that does feed <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? Did He not in such sort come hither, that He departed not thence? Did He not in such sort ascend, that He forsook not us? Wherefore then came He in the flesh? Because it behooved us to have the hope of resurrection shown unto us. God He was, and in flesh He came; for God could not die, flesh could die; He came then in the flesh, that He might die for us. But how died He for us? <q>Greater charity than this has no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172342"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;15:13</a></span> Charity therefore brought Him to the flesh. Whoever therefore has not charity denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has come in the flesh. Here then do you now question all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Did Christ come in the flesh? <q>He did come; this I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, this I confess.</q> Nay, this you deny. <q>How do I deny? You hear that I say it!</q> Nay, I convict you of denying it. You say with the voice, deniest with the heart; sayest in words, deniest in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. <q>How,</q> do you say, <q>do I deny in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>?</q> Because the end for which Christ came in the flesh, was, that He might die for us. He died for us, because therein He taught much charity. <q>Greater charity than this has no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</q> You have not charity, seeing you for your own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> dividest unity. Therefore by this understand ye the spirit that is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Give the earthen vessels a tap, put them to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, whether haply they be cracked and give a dull sound: see whether they ring full and clear, see whether charity be there. You take yourself away from the unity of the whole earth, you divide the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by schisms, you rend the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He came in the flesh, to gather in one, you make an outcry to scatter abroad. This then is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, which says that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> has come in the flesh, which says, not in tongue but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, which says, not by making a noise but by loving. And that spirit is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has come in the flesh; denies, here also, not in tongue but in life; not in words but in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. It is manifest therefore by what we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the brethren. Many within are in a sort within; but none without except he be indeed without.</p>

<p>14. Nay, and that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has referred the matter to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, he says, <q>And every spirit, <em>qui solvit Christum</em>, which does away with Christ that He came in the flesh,  is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> A doing away in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> is meant. What has he shown you? <q>That denies:</q> in that he says, <q>does away</q> (or, <q>unmakes</q>). He came to gather in one, you come to unmake. You would pull Christ's members asunder. How can it be said that you deny not that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has come in the flesh, who rendest assunder the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> which He has gathered together? Therefore you go against Christ; you are an antichrist. Be thou within, or be thou without, you are an antichrist: only, when you are within, you are hidden; when you are without, you are made manifest. Thou unmakest Jesus and deniest that He came in the flesh; you are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore He says in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Whoso shall break  one of these least commandments, and shall teach so, shall be called least in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172345"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;5:19</a></span> What is this breaking? What this teaching? A breaking in the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and a teaching as it were in words.  <q>Thou that preachest men should not steal, do you steal?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172347"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;2:21</a></span> Therefore he that steals breaks or undoes the commandment in his deed, and as it were teaches so: <q>he shall be called least in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>,</q> <em> i.e.</em> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of this present time.  Of him it is said, <q>What they say do ye; but what they do, that do not ye. <span class="stiki" id="note172349"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;23:3</a></span> But he that shall do, and shall teach so, shall be called great in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> From this, that He has here said, <em>fecerit</em>, <q>shall do,</q> while in opposition to this He has there said <em>solverit</em>, meaning <em>non fecerit</em>, <q>shall not do, and shall teach so</q>&mdash; to break, then, is, not to do&mdash; what does He teach us, but that we should interrogate men's <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, not take their words upon trust? The obscurity of the things compels us to speak much at length, chiefly that that which the Lord deigns to reveal may be brought within reach even of the brethren of slower understanding, because all were bought by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And I am afraid the epistle itself will not be finished during these days as I promised: but as the Lord will, it is better to reserve the remainder, than to overload your hearts with too much food.</p>
