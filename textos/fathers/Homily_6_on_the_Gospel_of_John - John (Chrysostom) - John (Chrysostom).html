<h1>Homily 6 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 1:6</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</q></div>

<p>1. Having in the introduction spoken to us things of urgent importance  concerning <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, (the Evangelist) proceeding on his road, and in order, afterwards comes to the herald of the Word, his namesake John. And now that you hear that he was <q>sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> do not for the future <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that any of the words spoken by him are mere man's words; for all that he utters is not his own, but is of Him who sent him. Wherefore he is called  <q>messenger</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse1">Malachi 3:1</a></span>, for the excellence of a messenger is, that he say nothing of his own. But the expression <q>was,</q> in this place is not significative of his coming into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but refers to his office of messenger; for <q>'there was' a man sent from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> is used instead of <q>a man 'was sent' from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>How then do some say,  that the expression, <q>being in the form of God</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians 2:6</a></span> is not  used of His invariable likeness  to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, because no article is added?  For observe, that the article is nowhere added here. Are these words then not spoken of the Father? What then shall we say to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who says, that, <q>Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who shall prepare Your way</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse1">Malachi 3:1</a>, as found in <a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse2">Mark 1:2</a></span>? For the expressions <q>My</q> and <q>Your</q> declare two Persons.</p>

<h2>John 1:7</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>The same came for a witness, to bear witness of that Light.</q></div>

<p>What is this, perhaps one may say, the servant bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to his Master? When then you see Him not only witnessed to by His servant, but even coming to him, and with <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him, will you not be still more astonished and perplexed? Yet you ought not to be troubled nor confused, but amazed at such unspeakable goodness. Though if any still continue bewildered  and confused, He will say to such an one what He said to John, <q>Suffer it to be so now, for thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse15">Matthew 3:15</a></span>; and, if any be still further troubled, again He will say to him too  what he said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>But I receive not testimony from man.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse34">John 5:34</a></span> If now he needs not this <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, why was John sent from God? Not as though He required his testimony&mdash; this were extremest <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. Why then? John himself informs us, when he says,</p>

<p><q>That all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> through him might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q></p>

<p>And Christ also, after having said that <q>I receive not testimony from man</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse34">John 5:34</a></span>, in order that He may not seem to the foolish to clash with  Himself, by declaring at one time <q>There is another that bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his  <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse32">John 5:32</a></span> (for He pointed to John;) and at another, <q>I receive not testimony from man</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse34">John 5:34</a></span>; He immediately adds the solution of the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, <q>But these things I say</q> for your own sake,  <q>that you might be saved.</q> As though He had said, that <q>I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the really-Begotten  <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and am of that Simple and Blessed Essence, I need none to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Me; and even though none would do so, yet am not I by this anything diminished in My Essence; but because I care for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the many,  I have descended to such humility as to commit the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of Me to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> For by reason of the groveling nature and infirmity of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him would in this way be more easily received, and more palatable.  As then He clothed Himself with flesh, that he might not, by encountering men with the unveiled Godhead, destroy them all; so He sent forth a man for His herald, that those who heard might at the hearing of a kindred voice approach more readily. For (to prove) that He had no need of that (herald's) testimony, it would have sufficed that He should only have shown Himself who He was in His unveiled Essence, and have confounded them all. But this He did not for the reason I have before mentioned. He would have annihilated  all, since none could have endured the encounter of that unapproachable light.  Wherefore, as I said, He put on flesh, and entrusted the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> (of Himself) to one of our fellow-servants, since He arranged  all for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, looking not only to His own <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but also to what might be readily received by, and be profitable to, His hearers. Which He glanced at when He said, <q>These things I say</q> for your sake, <q>that you might be saved.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse34">John 5:34</a></span> And the Evangelist using the same language as his Master, after saying, <q>to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of that Light,</q> adds,</p>

<p><q>That all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> through Him might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> All but saying, Think not that the reason why John the Baptist came to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, was that he might add anything to the trustworthiness of his Master. No; (He came,) that by his means beings of his own class  might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For it is clear from what follows, that he used this expression in his anxiety to remove this suspicion beforehand, since he adds,</p>

<h2>John 1:8</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>He was not that Light.</q></div>

<p>Now if he did not introduce this as setting himself against this suspicion, then the expression is absolutely superfluous, and tautology rather than elucidation of his teaching. For why, after having said that he <q>was sent to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of that Light,</q> does he again say, <q>He was not that Light</q>? (He says it,) not loosely or without reason; but, because, for the most part, among ourselves, the person witnessing is held to be greater, and generally more trustworthy than the person witnessed of; therefore, that none might suspect this in the case of John, at once from the very beginning he removes this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suspicion, and having torn it up by the roots, shows who this is that bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and who is He who is witnessed of, and what an interval there is between the witnessed of, and the bearer of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. And after having done this, and shown His incomparable superiority, he afterwards proceeds fearlessly to the narrative which remains; and after carefully removing whatever strange (ideas) might secretly harbor  in the  minds of the simpler sort, so instills into all  easily and without impediment the word of doctrine in its proper order.</p>

<p>Let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> then, that henceforth with the revelation of these thoughts and rightness of doctrine, we may have also a pure life and bright conversation,  since these things profit nothing unless good works be present with us. For though we have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, yet if we be naked and destitute of the protection derived from (<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>) living, there is nothing to hinder us from being hurried into the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and burning for ever in the unquenchable flame. For as they who have done good shall rise to life everlasting, so they who have dared the contrary shall rise to everlasting punishment, which never has an end. Let us then manifest all eagerness not to mar the gain which accrues to us from a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> by the vileness of our actions, but becoming well-pleasing to Him by these also, boldly to look on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. No <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> can be equal to this. And may it come to pass, that we all having obtained  what has been mentioned, may do all to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to whom, with the Only-Begotten Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
