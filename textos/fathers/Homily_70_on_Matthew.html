<h1>Homily 70 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse15">Matt. XXII. 15</a>.</strong></p>

<p><q>Then went the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and took counsel how they might entangle Him in His talk.</q></p>

<p>Then. When? When most of all they ought to have been moved to compunction, when they should have been amazed at His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when they should have feared the things to come, when from the past they ought to have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> touching the future also. For indeed the things that had been said cried aloud in actual fulfillment. I mean, that <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and harlots <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and righteous men were slain, and from these things they ought not to have gainsaid touching their own destruction, but even to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and to be sobered.</p>

<p>But nevertheless not even so do their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> acts cease, but travail and proceed further. And forasmuch as they could not lay hands on Him (for they feared the multitude), they took another way with the intention of bringing Him into danger, and making Him guilty of crimes against the state.</p>

<p>For <q>they sent out unto Him their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with the Herodians saying, Master, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and teachest the way of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, neither do you care for any man; for you regard not the person of men. Tell us therefore, What do you think? Is it lawful to give tribute unto C&aelig;sar or not?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202617"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;22:16-17</a></span> </p>

<p>For they were now tributaries, their state having passed under the rule of the Romans. Forasmuch then as they saw that Theudas and Judas <span class="stiki" id="note202618"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse36">Acts&nbsp;5:36-37</a></span> with their companies for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, as having prepared for a revolt, they were minded to bring Him too by these words into such a suspicion. Therefore they sent both their own <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> soldiers, digging, as they thought, a precipice on either side, and in every direction setting the snare, so that, whatever He should say, they might lay hold of it; and if He should answer in favor of the Herodians, themselves might find fault with Him, but if in their favor, the others should accuse Him. And yet He had given the didrachmas, but they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that.</p>

<p>And in either way indeed they expected to lay hold of Him; but they desired rather that He should say something against the Herodians. Wherefore they send their <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> also to urge Him thereto by their presence, that they might deliver Him to the governor as an usurper. For this Luke also intimates and shows, by saying, that they asked also in the presence of the multitude, so that the testimony should be the stronger.</p>

<p>But the result was altogether opposite; for in a larger body of spectators they afforded the demonstration of their folly.</p>

<p>And see their flattery, and their hidden craft. <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> their words are, <q>that You are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> How said ye then, <q>He is a deceiver,</q> and <q>deceives the people,</q> and <q>has a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> and <q>is not of God?</q> how a little while before did ye devise to slay Him?</p>

<p>But they are at everything, whatsoever their craft against Him may suggest. For since,  when a little before they had said in self will, <q>By what authority doest Thou these things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202621"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;21:23</a></span> they did not meet with an answer to the question, they look to puff Him up by their flattery, and to persuade Him to say something against the established <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and opposed to the prevailing government.</p>

<p>Wherefore also they testify the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> unto Him, confessing what was really so, nevertheless, not with an upright <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, nor willingly; and add thereto, saying, <q>You care not for any man.</q> See how plainly they are desiring to urge Him to these sayings, that would make Him both offend <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and incur the suspicion of being an usurper, as standing up against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, so that they might punish Him, as a mover of sedition, and an usurper. For in saying, <q>You care not for any man,</q> and, <q>Thou regardest not the person of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> they were hinting at <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p><q>Tell us therefore, what thinkest Thou?</q> Now ye <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> Him, and esteem Him a Teacher, having despised and insulted Him oftentimes, when He was discoursing of the things that concern your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Whence also they have become confederates.</p>

<p>And see their craftiness. They say not, Tell us what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, what is expedient, what is lawful? But, <q>What thinkest Thou?</q> So much did they look to this one object, to betray Him, and to set Him at enmity with the rulers. And Mark declaring this, and more plainly discovering their self-will, and their murderous disposition, affirms them to have said, <q>Shall we give C&aelig;sar tribute, or shall we not give?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202622"><a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse15">Mark&nbsp;12:15</a></span> So that they were breathing <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and travailing with a plot against Him, yet they feigned respect.</p>

<p>What then says He? <q>Why do you tempt me, you hypocrites?</q> Do you see how He talks with them with more than usual severity? For since their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> was now complete and manifest, He cuts the deeper, first confounding and silencing them, by publishing their secret thoughts, and making it manifest to all with what kind of intent they are coming unto Him.</p>

<p>And these things He did, repulsing their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, so that they might not suffer hurt in attempting the same things again. And yet their words were full of much respect, for they both called Him Master, and bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that He was no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; but being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He was deceived by none of these things. Wherefore they also ought to have conjectured, that the rebuke was not the result of conjecture, but a sign of His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> their secret thoughts.</p>

<p>2. He stopped not, however, at the rebuke, although it was enough merely to have convicted them of their purpose, and to have put them to shame for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; but He stops not at this, but in another way closes their mouths; for, <q>Show me,</q> says He, <q>the tribute money.</q> And when they had shown it, as He ever does, by their tongue He brings out the decision, and causes them to decide, that it is lawful; which was a clear and plain victory. So that, when He asks, not from <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> does He ask, but because it is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to be bound by their own answers. For when, on being asked, <q>Whose is the image?</q> they said, <q>C&aelig;sar's;</q> He says, <q>Render unto C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's.</q>  For this is not to give but to render, and this He shows both by the image, and by the superscription.</p>

<p>Then that they might not say, You are subjecting us to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, He added, <q>And unto God the things that are God's.</q> For it is possible both to fulfill to men their claims and to give unto God the things that are due to God from us. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says, <q>Render unto all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to whom <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202624"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;13:7</a></span> </p>

<p>But you, when you hear, <q>Render unto C&aelig;sar the things which are C&aelig;sar's,</q> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is speaking only of those things, which are no detriment to godliness; since if it be any such thing as this, such a thing is no longer C&aelig;sar's tribute, but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a>.</p>

<p>When they heard these things, their mouths were stopped, and they <q>marvelled</q> at His wisdom. Ought they not then to have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, ought they not to have been amazed. For indeed, He gave them <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His Godhead, by revealing the secrets of their hearts, and with gentleness did He silence them.</p>

<p>What then? Did they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? By no means, but they <q>left Him, and went their way;</q> and after them, <q>came to Him the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>.</q></p>

<p>O folly! When the others had been put to silence, these made the attack, when they ought to have been the more backward. But such is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of rashness, shameless, and importunate, and attempting things impossible. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> also, amazed at their folly, signified this very thing, by saying, <q>On that day came to Him.</q>  On that day. On what day? In which He had convicted their craftiness, and put them to shame. But who are these? A <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> different  from the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and much worse than they, who said, <q>that there is no resurrection, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, nor spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202626"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;23:8</a></span> For these were some of a grosser sort, and eager after the things of the body. For there were many <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> even among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says, <q>I am a <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, of the strictest <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> among us.</q>  </p>

<p>And they say nothing indeed directly about a resurrection; but they feign a story, and make up a case, which, as I suppose, never so much as had an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; thinking to drive Him to perplexity, and desiring to overthrow both things, both the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of a resurrection, and of such a resurrection.</p>

<p>And again, these too attack Him with a show of moderation, saying, <q>Master, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, If a man die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased; and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother. Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh. And last of all the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> died also. Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven?</q>  </p>

<p>See Him answering these like a teacher. For though out of craft they came unto Him, yet was their question rather one of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Therefore neither does He say unto them, <q>You hypocrites.</q></p>

<p>Moreover, in order that He might not blame, saying, <q>Wherefore had seven one wife?</q> they add the authority of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; although, as I have said before, it was a fiction, in my judgment at least. For the third would not have taken her, when he saw the two bridegrooms dead; or if the third, yet not the fourth or the fifth; and if even these, much more the sixth or the seventh would not have come unto the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but have shrunk from her. For such is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For if now many have this feeling, much more then had they; when at least, even without this, they often avoided marrying in this way, and that when the law was constraining them. Thus, at any rate, Ruth, that Moabitish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, was thrust off to him that was further off from her kindred; and Tamar too was thus compelled to obtain, by stealth, seed from her husband's kinsman.</p>

<p>And wherefore did they not feign two or three, but seven? In order the more abundantly to bring derision, as they thought, upon the resurrection. Wherefore they further say, <q>they all had her,</q> as driving Him into some difficulty.</p>

<p>What then says Christ? He replies unto both, as taking His stand not against the words, but the purpose, and on every occasion revealing the secrets of their hearts; and at one time exposing them, at another time leaving the refutation of them that question Him to their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. See, at any rate here, how He proves both points, as well that there will be a resurrection, as that it will not be such a resurrection as they suspect.</p>

<p>For what says He? <q>You do <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, nor the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202630"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;22:29</a></span> For since, as if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them, they put forward <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the law, He shows that this question is that of men very <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For hence also arose their tempting Him, from their being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and from their not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the power of God as they ought.</p>

<p><q>For what marvel then is it,</q> He says, <q>if you tempt me, who am as yet unknown to you, when at least ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not so much as the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of which you have had so much experience, and neither from common sense nor from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> have become acquainted with it;</q> if indeed even common sense causes us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that to God all things are possible. And in the first place He answers to the question asked. For since this was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for their not believing a resurrection, that they think the order of things is like this, He cures the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, then the symptom also (for thence arose the disease too), and shows the manner of the resurrection. <q>For in the resurrection,</q> says He, <q>they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q>  But Luke says, <q>As Sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202632"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;20:36</a></span> </p>

<p>If then they marry not, the question is vain. But not because they do not marry, therefore are they <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but because they are as <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, therefore they do not marry. By this He removed many other difficulties also, all which things <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> intimated by one word, saying, <q>For the fashion of this world passes away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202633"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:31</a></span> </p>

<p>And by these words He declared how great a thing the resurrection is; and that moreover there is a resurrection, He proves. And indeed this too was demonstrated at the same time by what He had said, nevertheless over and above He adds again to His word by what He says now. For neither at their question only did He stop, but at their  thought. Thus when they are not dealing with great craft, but are asking in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, He teaches even over and above, but when it is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> only, not even to their question does He answer.</p>

<p>And again by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> does He stop their mouths, since they too had brought forward <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and He says, <q>But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read, I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Isaac, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob? He is not the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the dead, but of the living.</q>  Not of them that are not His meaning is, and that are utterly blotted out, and are to rise no more. For He said not, I was, but, I am; of them that are, and them that live. For like as Adam, although he lived on the day that he ate of the tree, died in the sentence: even so also these, although they had died, lived in the promise of the resurrection.</p>

<p>How then does He say elsewhere, <q>That He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202635"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;14:9</a></span> But this is not contrary to that. For here He speaks of the dead, who are also themselves to live. And moreover too, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q> is another thing from, <q>That He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</q> He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> of another death too, concerning which He says, <q>Let the dead bury their dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202636"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;8:22</a></span> </p>

<p><q>And when the multitudes heard this, they were astonished at His doctrine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202637"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;22:33</a></span> Yet not even here the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>; but these go away defeated, while the impartial multitude reap the benefit.</p>

<p>Since then the resurrection is like this, come let us do all things, that we may obtain the first <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> there. But, if you will, let us show you some even before the resurrection here pursuing and reaping these blessings, again having made our resort to the deserts. For again will I enter upon the same discourse, since I see you listening with more pleasure.</p>

<p>Let us behold then today also the spiritual camps, let us behold their pleasure unalloyed with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For not with spears are they encamped like the soldiers, for at this point I lately ended my discourse, neither with shields and breastplates; but bare of all these will you see them, yet achieving such things, as not even with arms do they.</p>

<p>And if you are able to observe, come and stretch forth your hand to me, and let us go unto this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, both of us, and let us see their battle array. For these too fight every day, and slay their adversaries, and conquer all the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> that are plotting against us; and you will see these cast out on the ground, and not able so much as to struggle, but proving by very deed that saying of the apostle, <q>They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202638"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse24">Galatians&nbsp;5:24</a></span> </p>

<p>Do you see a multitude of dead lying there, slain by the sword of the Spirit? Therefore in that place is no <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> nor <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>. And their table proves it, and the trophy that is set thereon. For <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> lie dead, put to the rout by the drinking of water, though this be multiform, and a many-headed monster. For like as in the fabled Scylla and Hydra, so in <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> may one see many heads, on one side fornication growing up, on another <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; on one hand sloth, on another lawless <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; but all these things are taken away. And yet all those other armies, though they get the better in ten thousand <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, are taken captive by these; and neither arms, nor spears, nor whatever else there may be, is able to stand against these phalanxes; but the very giants, the heroes, those that do countless brave <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, you will find without bonds bound by sleep and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, without slaughter or wounds lying like the wounded, or rather in more grievous case. For those at least struggle; but these do not even this, but straightway give up.</p>

<p>Do you see that this host is greater and more to be admired? For the enemies that got the better of the others it destroys by its mere will. For they do so weaken the mother of all their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, that she cannot even trouble them any more; and the leader being overthrown, and the head removed, the rest of the body also lies still.</p>

<p>And this victory one may see each of them, that abide there, achieving. For it is not as in these <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of ours, where, if any enemy has received a blow from one, he is no more grievous to another, having been once overthrown; but it is necessary for all to smite this monster; and he that has not smitten and overthrown her, is surely troubled by her.</p>

<p>Do you see a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> victory? For such a trophy as the hosts in all parts of the world having met together have not power to erect, this each one of those men erects; and all things that from the army of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> lie mingled together wounded, delirious words of frenzy, insane thoughts, unpleasing haughtiness. And they imitate their own Lord, at whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> marvelling says, <q>He shall drink of the brook in the way, therefore shall He lift up the head.</q>  </p> 

<p>Would ye see also another multitude of dead? Let us see the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> that arise from luxurious living, those that are cherished by the makers of sauces, by the cooks, the furnishers of feasts, the confectioners. For I am ashamed indeed to speak of all; however, I will tell of the birds from Phasis, the soups that are mixed from various things: the moist, the dry dishes, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made about these things. For like as if ordering some city and marshalling hosts, even so these too make <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and ordain such a thing first, and such a thing second, and some bring in first birds roasted on the embers, filled within with fish; and others make of other material the beginnings of these unlawful feasts; and there is much rivalry about these things, about quality, and about order, and about quantity; and they take a <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in the things, for which they ought to bury themselves for shame; some saying that they have spent the half of the day, some all of it, some that they have added the night too. Behold, O wretched man, the measure of your belly, and be ashamed of your unmeasured earnestness!</p>

<p>But there is nothing like this among those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but all these desires also are dead. For their meals are not unto fullness, and unto luxurious living, but unto necessity. No bird hunters are there, no fishermen, but bread and water. But this confusion, and the disturbance, and the turmoils, are all removed from thence, alike from the house and from the body, and great is the haven, but among these great the tempest.</p>

<p>Burst open now in thought the belly of them who feed on such things, and you will see the vast refuse, and the unclean channel, and the whited sepulchre.</p>

<p>But what come after these I am even ashamed to tell, the disagreeable eructations, the vomitings, the discharges downwards and upwards.</p>

<p>But go and see even these desires dead there, and those more violent <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> that spring from these; I mean, those of impurity. For these too you will see all overthrown, with their horses, with their beasts of burden. For the beast of burden, and the weapon, and the horse of a filthy deed, is a filthy word. But you will see such like horse and rider together, and their weapons thrown down; but here quite the contrary, and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> cast down dead. But not at their meal only is the victory of these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, but in the other things also, in money, in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, in all diseases of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Surely does not this host seem to you mightier than that, and the meal better? Nay, who will gainsay it? None, not even of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> themselves, though he be very mad. For this guides us on to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, that drags to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>; this the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> lays out, that Christ; for this luxury gives <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and intemperance, for that self-denial and sobriety, here Christ is present, there the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For where there is <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is there; where there are filthy words, where there is surfeiting, there the devils hold their choirs. Such a table had that rich man, therefore not even of a drop of water was he master.</p>

<p>But these have not such a table, but they already practise the ways of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. They marry not, they are not given in marriage, neither do they sleep excessively, nor live luxuriously, but except a few things they are even bodiless.</p>

<p>Now who is there that so easily overcomes his enemies as he that sets up a trophy while at his dinner? Therefore also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>You have prepared a table before me, in the presence of them that trouble me.</q>  One could not be wrong in repeating this oracle about this table. For nothing so troubles a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as disorderly concupiscence, and luxury, and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that spring from these; and this they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> full well who have had experience thereof.</p>

<p>And if you were to learn also, whence this table is procured, and whence that; then you would see well the difference between each. Whence then is this procured. From countless tears, from <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> defrauded, from <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a> despoiled; but the other from honest labor. And this table is like to a fair and well-favored <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, needing nothing external, but having her beauty from nature; but that to some ugly and ill-favored harlot, wearing much paint, but not able to disguise her deformity, but the nearer she is, the more convicted. For this too, when it is nearer to him that is at it, then shows its ugliness more. For look not I tell you, at the banqueters, as they come only, but also as they go away, and then you will see its ugliness. For that, as being free, suffers them that come unto it to say nothing shameful; but this nothing seemly, as being a harlot, and dishonored. This seeks the profit of him that is at it, that the hurt. And one permits not to offend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other permits not but that we must offend Him.</p>

<p>Let us go away therefore unto those men. Thence we shall learn with how many bonds we are encompassed. Thence shall we learn to set before ourselves a table full of countless blessings, most sweet, without cost, delivered from care, free from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and jealousy  and every disease, and full of good hope, and having its many trophies. No turmoil of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there, no sorrow, no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; all is calm, all is peace.</p>

<p>For tell me not of the silence of them that serve in the houses of the rich, but of the clamor of them that dine; I mean, not that which they make one to another (for this too is worthy of derision), but that within, that in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that brings on them a great captivity, the tumults of the thoughts, the sleet, the darkness, the tempest, by which all things are mingled and confused, and are like to some night battle. But not in the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks'</a> tents are such things as these; but great is the calm, great the quietness. And that table is succeeded by a sleep that is like death, but this by sobriety and wakefulness; that by punishment, this by the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> rewards.</p>

<p>This then let us follow, that we may enjoy also the fruits thereof; unto which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant we may all attain, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
