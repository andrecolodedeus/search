<h1>Homily 70 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 13:1</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them unto the end.</q></div>

<p>1. <q> Be imitators of me,</q> said <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse1">1 Corinthians 11:1</a></span> For on this account He took also flesh of our substance,  that by means of it He might teach us <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For (<q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> sending His own Son) in the likeness of sinful flesh,</q> it says, <q>and for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans 8:3</a></span> And Christ Himself  says, <q>Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew 11:29</a></span> And this He taught, not by words alone, but by actions also. For they called Him a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, and one that had a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and a deceiver, and cast stones at Him; and at one time the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> sent servants to take  Him, at another they sent plotters against Him; and they continued  also insulting Him themselves, and that when they had no fault to find, but were even being continually benefited. Still after such conduct He ceases not to do well to them both by words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. And, when a certain domestic smote Him on the face, He said, <q>If I have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but if well, why do you smite Me?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse23">John 18:23</a></span> But this was to those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and plotted against Him. Let us see also what He does now towards the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, or rather what actions He now exhibits  towards the traitor. The man whom most of all there was reason  to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, because being a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, having shared the table and the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, having seen the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and been deemed worthy of such great things, he acted more grievously than any, not <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoning</a> indeed, nor insulting Him, but betraying and giving Him up, observe in how friendly sort He receives this man, washing his feet; for even in this way He desired to restrain him from that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Yet it was in His power, had He willed it, to have withered him like the fig-tree, to have cut him in two as He rent the rocks, to have cleft him asunder like the veil; but He would not lead him away from his design by compulsion, but by choice. Wherefore He washed his feet; and not even by this was that wretched and miserable man shamed.</p>

<p><q>Before the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the Passover</a>,</q> it says, <q>Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that His hour had come.</q> Not then <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>,</q> but (it means) that He did what He did having <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a></q> long ago. <q>That He should depart.</q> Magnificently  the Evangelist calls His death, <q>departure.</q> <q>Having loved His own, He loved them unto the end.</q> Do you see how when about to leave them He shows greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? For the, <q>having loved, He loved them unto the end,</q> shows that he omitted nothing of the things which it was likely that one who earnestly loved would do. Why, then did He not this from the beginning? He works  the greatest things last, so as to render more intense their attachment, and to lay up for them beforehand much comfort, against the terrible things that were about to fall on them. St. John calls them <q>His own,</q> in respect of personal attachment, since he calls others also <q>His own,</q> in respect of the work of creation; as when he says, <q>His own received Him not.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse11">John 1:11</a></span> But what means, <q>which were in the world</q>? Because the dead also were <q>His own,</q> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, Jacob, and the men of that sort,  but they were not in the world. Do you see that He is the God both of the Old and New (Testament)? But what means, <q>He loved them unto the end</q>? It stands for, <q>He continued loving them unceasingly,</q> and this the Evangelist mentions as a sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of great affection. Elsewhere indeed He spoke of another (<a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>), the laying down life for His friends; but that had not yet come to pass. And wherefore did He this thing <q>now</q>? Because it was far more wonderful at a time when He appeared more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in the sight of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. Besides, He left them no small consolation now that He was about to depart, for since they were going to be greatly grieved, He by these means introduces also comfort to the grief.</p>

<h2>John 13:2</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And supper being ended, the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas  to betray Him.</q></div>

<p>This the Evangelist has said  amazed, showing that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> washed the man who had already chosen to betray Him. This also proves his great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that not even the having shared the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> restrained him, (a thing which is most able to restrain <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>;) not the fact that even up to the last day, his Master continued to bear with him. </p>

<h2>John 13:3</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Jesus knowing that the Father had given  all things into His hands, and that He had come from God, and went to God.</q></div>

<p>Here the Evangelist says, even  wondering, that one so great, so very great, who came from God and went to Him, who rules over all, did this thing, and disdained not even so to undertake such an action. And by the <q>giving over,</q> methinks St. John means the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. For when He says, <q>All things are given over  to Me of My Father</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew 11:27</a></span>, He speaks of this kind of giving over; as also in another place He says, <q>Yours they were, and You gave them Me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse6">John 17:6</a></span>; and again, <q>No man can come unto Me except the Father draw him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse44">John 6:44</a></span>; and, <q>Except it be given him from heaven.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse27">John 3:27</a></span> The Evangelist then either means this, or that Christ would be nothing lessened by this action, since He came from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and went to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and possessed all things. But when you hear of <q>giving over,</q> understand it in no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense, for it shows how He <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and His unanimity with Him. For as the Father gives over to Him, so He to the Father. And this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declares, saying, <q>When He shall have given over  the kingdom to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even the Father.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1 Corinthians 15:24</a></span> But St. John has said it here in a more <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense, showing His great care for them, and declaring His unutterable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that He now cared for them as for His own; teaching them the mother of all good, even  humblemindedness, which He said was both the beginning and the end of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And not without a reason is added the,  <q>He came from God and went to God</q>: but that we may learn that He did what was worthy  of One who came thence and went there, trampling down all <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</p>

<h2>John 13:4</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And having risen  from supper, and laid aside His garments.</q> </div>

<p>2. Observe how not by the washing only, but in another way also He exhibits humility. For it was not before reclining, but after they had all sat down, then He arose. In the next place, He does not merely wash them, but does so, putting off His garments. And He did not even stop here, but girded Himself with a towel. Nor was He satisfied with this, but Himself filled (the basin), and did not bid another fill it; He did all these things Himself, showing by all that we must do such things, when we are engaged in well doing, not merely for form's sake,  but with all <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. Now He seems to me to have washed the feet of the traitor first from its saying,</p>

<h2>John 13:5</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>He began to wash the disciples' feet,</q>  and adding,</div>

<h2>John 13:6</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Then comes He to Simon Peter and Peter says unto Him, Lord, do You wash my feet?</q></div>

<p><q>With those hands,</q> he says, <q>with which You have opened eyes, and cleansed <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a>, and raised the dead?</q> For this (question) is very emphatic; wherefore He needed not to have said any more than the, <q>Thou</q>; for even of itself this would have sufficed to convey the whole. Some one might reasonably enquire, how none of the others forbade Him, but Peter only, which was a mark of no slight <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and reverence. What then is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? He seems to me to have washed the traitor first, then to have come to Peter, and that the others were afterwards instructed from his case.  That He washed some one other before him is clear from its saying, <q>But when He came  to Peter.</q> Yet the Evangelist is not a vehement accuser,  for the <q>began,</q> is the expression of one implying this. And even if Peter were the first,  yet it is probable that the traitor, being a forward person, had reclined even before the chief.  For by another circumstance also his forwardness is shown, when He dips with his Master in the dish, and being convicted, feels no compunction; while Peter being rebuked but once on a former occasion, and for words which he spoke from loving affection, was so abashed, that being even distressed and trembling, he begged another to ask a question. But Judas, though continually convicted, felt not. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse24">John 13:24</a></span> When therefore He came to Peter, he says unto Him, <q>Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?</q></p>

<h2>John 13:7</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>He says unto him, What I do you know not now, but you shall know here after.</q></div>

<p>That is <q>you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how great is the gain from this, the profit of the lesson, and how it is able to guide us into all humblemindedness.</q> What then does Peter? He still hinders Him, and says,</p>

<h2>John 13:8</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>You shall never wash my feet.</q> <q>What doest thou, Peter? Rememberest thou not those former words? Did you not say, 'Be merciful to Yourself,'  and heardest thou not in return, 'Get behind Me, Satan'?<span class="stiki"> <a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse22">Matthew 16:22</span> Are you not even so sobered, but are you yet vehement?</q> <q>Yea,</q> he says, <q>for what is being done is a great matter, and full of amazement.</q> Since then he did this from exceeding love, Christ in turn subdues him by the same; and as there He effected this by sharply rebuking him, and saying, <q>You are an offense unto Me,</q> so here also by saying,</div>

<p><q>If I wash you not, you have no part with Me.</q> What then says that hot and burning one?</p>

<h2>John 13:9</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</q></div>

<p>Vehement in deprecation, he becomes yet more vehement in acquiescence; but both from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For why said He not wherefore He did this, instead of adding a threat? Because Peter would not have been persuaded. For had He said, <q>Suffer it, for by this I persuade you to be humbleminded,</q> Peter would have promised it ten thousand times, in order that his Master might not do this thing. But now what says He? He speaks of that which Peter most feared and dreaded, the being separated from Him; for it is he who continually asks, <q>Where are You going?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse36">John 13:36</a></span> Wherefore also he said, <q>I will give  even my life for You.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse37">John 13:37</a></span> And if, after hearing, <q>What I do you know not now, but you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> hereafter,</q> he still persisted, much more would he have done so had he learned (the meaning of the action). Therefore said He, <q>but you shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> hereafter,</q> as being aware, that should he learn it immediately he would still resist. And Peter said not, <q>Tell me, that I may suffer You,</q> but (which was much more vehement) he did not even endure to learn, but withstands Him,   saying, <q>You shall never wash my feet.</q> But as soon as He threatened, he straightway relaxed his tone. But what means, <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> after this</q>? <q>After this?</q> When? <q>When in My Name you shall have cast out devils; when you shall have seen Me taken up into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, when you shall have learned from the Spirit  that I sit  on His right hand, then shall you understand what is being done now.</q> What then says Christ? When Peter said, <q>not my feet only, but also my hands and my head,</q> He replies,</p>

<h2>John 13:10-11</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>He that is washed, needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit; and you are clean,  but not all. For He knew who should betray Him.</q> </div>

<p><q>And if they are clean, why washes He  their feet?</q> That we may learn to be modest.  On which account He came not to any other part of the body, but to that which is considered more dishonorable than the rest. But what is, <q>He that is washed</q>? It is instead of, <q>he that is clean.</q> Were they then clean, who had not  yet been delivered from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor deemed worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> still had the mastery, the handwriting of the curse still remaining, the victim not having yet been offered? How then calls He them <q>clean</q>? That you may not deem them clean, as delivered from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He adds,  Behold, <q>you are clean through the word that I have spoken unto you.</q> That is, <q>In this way you are so far  clean; you have received the light, you have been freed from Jewish <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For the Prophet also says, 'Wash you, make you clean, put away the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls'</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse16">Isaiah 1:16</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span>; so that such a one is washed and is clean.</q> Since then these men had cast away all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and had companied with Him with a pure <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, therefore He says according to the word of the Prophet, <q>he that is washed is clean already.</q> For in that place also It means not the <q>washing</q> of water, practiced by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; but the cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. </p>

<p>3. Be we then also clean; learn we to do well. But what is <q>well</q>? &nbsp;<q>Judge for the fatherless, plead for the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>; and come, let us reason together, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse7">Isaiah 1:7</a></span> There is frequent mention in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>, but we make no account of this. Yet consider how great is the reward. <q>Though,</q> it says, <q>your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be as scarlet, I will whiten them as snow; though they be red like crimson, I will whiten them as wool.</q> For a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is an unprotected being, therefore He  takes much care for her. For they, when it is even in their power to contract a second marriage, endure the hardships of widowhood through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let us then all, both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, stretch forth our hands to them, that we may never undergo the sorrows of widow-hood; or if we should have to undergo them, let us lay up  a great store of kindness for ourselves. Not small is the power of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> tears, it is able to open heaven itself. Let us not then trample on them, nor make their calamity worse, but assist them by every means. If so we do, we shall put around  ourselves much safety, both in the present life, and in that which is to come. For not here alone, but there also will they be our defenders, cutting away most of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by reason of our beneficence towards them, and causing us to stand boldly before the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Which  may it come to pass that we all obtain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
