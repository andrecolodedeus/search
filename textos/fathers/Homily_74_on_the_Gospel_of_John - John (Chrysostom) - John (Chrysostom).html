<h1>Homily 74 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 14:8-9</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Philip says unto Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us. Jesus says unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me, has seen the Father.</q></div> 

<p>1. The Prophet said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>You had the countenance of a harlot, thou were shameless towards all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse3">Jeremiah 3:3</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> Now it seems fitting to use this expression not only against that city,  but against all who shamelessly set their faces against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For when Philip said to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>Show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> He replied, <q>Have I been so long time with you, and have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, Philip?</q> And yet there are some Who even after these words separate the Father from the Son. What proximity do you require closer than this? Indeed from this very saying some have fallen into the malady of Sabellius. But let us, leaving both these and those as involved in directly opposite <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, consider the exact meaning of the words. <q>Have I been so long time with you, and have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, Philip?</q> He says. What then? Replies Philip, <q>Are you the Father after whom I enquire?</q> <q>No,</q> He says. On this account He said not, <q>have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him,</q> but, <q>have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me,</q> declaring nothing else but this, that the Son is no other than what the Father is, yet continuing to be a Son. But how came Philip to ask this question? Christ had said, <q>If you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, you should have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> My Father also</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse7">John 14:7</a></span>, and He had often said the same to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Since then Peter and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had often asked Him, <q>Who is the Father?</q> since Thomas had asked Him, and no one had learned anything clear, but His words were still not understood; Philip, in order that He might not seem to be importunate and to trouble Him by asking in his turn after the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>Show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> added, <q>and it suffices us,</q> <q>we seek no more.</q> Yet Christ had said, <q>If you had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, you should have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> My Father also,</q> and by Himself He declared the Father. But Philip reversed the order, and said, <q>Show us the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> as though <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Christ exactly. But Christ endures him not, but puts him in the right way, persuading him to gain the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Father through Himself, while Philip desired to see Him with these bodily eyes, having perhaps heard concerning the Prophets, that they <q>saw God.</q> But those cases, Philip, were acts of condescension. Wherefore Christ said, <q>No man has seen God at any time</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John 1:18</a></span>; and again, <q>Every man that has heard and has learned from God comes unto Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse45">John 6:45</a></span> <q>You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse37">John 5:37</a></span> And in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, <q>No man shall see My face, and live.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse20">Exodus 33:20</a></span> What says Christ? Very reprovingly He says, <q>Have I been so long time with you, and have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me, Philip?</q> He said not, <q>have you not seen,</q> but, <q>have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me.</q> <q>Why,</q> Philip might say, <q>do I wish to learn concerning You? At present I seek to see Your Father, and You say unto me, have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me?</q> What connection then has this with the question? Surely a very close one; for if He is that which the Father is, yet continuing a Son, with reason He shows in Himself Him who begot Him. Then to distinguish the Persons He says, <q>He that has seen Me has seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> lest any one should assert that the same is Father, the same Son. For had He been the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He would not have said, <q>He that has seen Me has seen Him.</q> Why then did He not reply, <q>you ask things impossible, and not allowed to man; to Me alone is this possible</q>? Because Philip had said, <q>it suffices us,</q> as though <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Christ, He shows that he had not even seen Him. For assuredly he would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, had he been able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Son.  Wherefore He says, <q>He that has seen Me, has seen the Father.</q> <q>If any one has seen Me, he shall also behold Him.</q> What He says is of this kind: <q>It is not possible to see either Me or Him.</q> For Philip sought the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is by sight, and since he thought that he had so seen Christ, he desired in like manner to see the Father; but Jesus shows him that he had not even seen Himself. And if any one here call <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, sight, I do not contradict him, for, <q>he that has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me,</q> says Christ, <q>has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Father.</q> Yet He did not say this, but desiring to establish the Consubstantiality, declared, <q>he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> My Essence, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that of the Father also.</q> <q>And what is this?</q> says some one; <q>for he who is acquainted with creation <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also God.</q> Yet all are acquainted with creation, and have seen it, but all do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God. Besides, let us consider what Philip  seeks to see. Is it the wisdom of the Father? Is it His goodness? Not so, but the very whatever God is, the very Essence. To this therefore Christ answers, <q>He that has seen Me.</q> Now he that has seen the creation, has not also seen the Essence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>If any one has seen Me, he has seen the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> He says. Now had He been of a different Essence, He would not have spoken thus. But to make use of a grosser argument, no man that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not what gold is, can discern the substance of gold in silver. For one nature is not shown by another. Wherefore He rightly rebuked him, saying, <q>Am I so long with you?</q> Have you enjoyed such teaching, have you seen <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought with authority, and all belonging to the Godhead, which the Father alone works, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven, secrets published, death retreating, a creation wrought from earth,  and have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me? Because He was clothed with flesh, therefore He said, <q>Have you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Me?</q></p>

<p>2. You have seen the Father; seek not to see more; for in Him you have seen Me. If you have seen Me, be not over-curious; for you have also in Me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him.</p>

<h2>John 14:10</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Do you not believe that I am in the Father?</q> </div>

<p>That is, <q>I am seen in that Essence.</q></p>

<p><q>The words that I speak, I speak not of Myself,</q></p>

<p>Do you see the exceeding nearness, and the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the one Essence?</p>

<p><q>The Father that dwells in Me, He does the works.</q></p>

<p>How, beginning with words, does He come to works? For that which naturally followed was, that He should say, <q>the Father speaks the words.</q> But He puts two things here, both concerning doctrine and <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. Or it may have been because the words also were works. How then does He  them? In another place He says, <q>If I do not the works of My Father, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me not.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse37">John 10:37</a></span> How then says He here that the Father does them? To show this same thing, that there is no interval between the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. What He says is this: <q>The Father would not act in one way, and I in another.</q> Indeed in another place both He and the Father work; <q>My Father works hitherto, and I work</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John 5:17</a></span>; showing in the first passage the unvaryingness of the works,  in the second the identity. And if the obvious meaning of the words denotes humility, marvel not; for after having first said, <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>?</q> He then spoke thus, showing that He so modeled His words to bring him to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for He walked in their hearts.</p>

<h2>John 14:11</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Believe  that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.</q></div>

<p><q>You ought not, when you hear of 'Father' and 'Son,' to seek anything else to the establishing of the relationship  as to Essence, but if this is not sufficient to prove to you the Condignity and Consubstantiality, you may learn it even from the works.</q> Had the, <q>he that has seen Me, has seen My Father,</q> been used with respect to works, He would not afterwards have said,</p>

<p><q>Or else <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> Me for the very works' sake.</q> And then to show that He is not only able to do these things, but also other much greater than these, He puts them with excess. For He says not, <q>I can do greater things than these,</q> but, what was much more wonderful, <q>I can give to others also to do greater things than these.</q></p>

<h2>John 14:12</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believes in Me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to the Father.</q></div>

<p>That is, <q>it now remains for you to work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, for I go away.</q> Then when He had accomplished what His argument intended, He says,</p>

<h2>John 14:13</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Whatsoever you shall ask in My Name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in Me.</q></div>

<p>Do you see again that it is He who does it? <q>I,</q> says He, <q>will do it</q>; not, <q>I will ask of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> but, <q>that the Father may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in Me.</q> In another place He said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall glorify Him in Himself</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse32">John 13:32</a></span>, but here, <q>He shall glorify the Father</q>; for when the Son shall appear with great power, He who begot shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>. But what is, <q>in My Name</q>? That which the Apostles said, <q>In the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, arise and walk.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse6">Acts 3:6</a></span> For all the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which they did He wrought in them, and <q>the hand of the Lord was with them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse21">Acts 11:21</a></span></p>

<h2>John 14:14</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>I will do  it,</q> He says.</div>

<p>Do you see His authority? The things done by means of others Himself does; has He no power for the things done by Himself, except as being wrought in by the Father? And who could say this? But why does He put it second? To confirm His own words, and to show that the former sayings were of condescension. But the, <q>I go to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> is this: <q>I shall not perish, but remain in My own proper Dignity, and Am in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> All this He said, comforting them. For since it was likely that they, not yet understanding His discourses concerning the Resurrection, would <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> something dismal, He in other discourses promises that He will give them such things, soothing them in  every way, and showing that He abides continually; and not only abides, but that He will even show forth greater power.</p>

<p>3. Let us then follow Him, and take up the Cross. For though <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> be not present, yet the season for another kind of death is with us. <q>Mortify,</q> it says, <q>your members which are upon earth.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians 3:5</a></span> Let us then quench concupiscence, slay <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, abolish <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. This is a <q>living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a></span> This <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> ends not in ashes, is not dispersed in smoke, wants neither wood, nor fire, nor knife. For it has both fire and a knife, even the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Using this knife, circumcise the superfluous and alien portion of your heart; open the closedness of your ears, for <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>  and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires are wont to stop the way against the entrance of the word. The desire of money, when it is set before one, permits not to hear the word concerning almsgiving; and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> when it is present raises a wall against the teaching concerning <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and some other malady falling on in its turn, makes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> yet more dull to all things. Let us then do away these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> desires; it is enough to have willed, and all are quenched. For let us not, I entreat, look to this, that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is a tyrannical thing, but that the tyranny is that of our own slackmindedness. Many indeed say that they do not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what money is. For this desire is not a natural one; such as are natural were implanted in us from the first, from the beginning, but as for gold and silver, for a long time not even what it is was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Whence then grew this desire? From vainglory and extreme slackmindedness. For of desires some are necessary, some natural, some neither the one nor the other. For example, those which if not gratified destroy the creature are both natural and necessary, as the desire of meat and drink and sleep; carnal desire is natural indeed but not necessary, for many have got the better of it, and have not died. But the desire of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is neither natural nor necessary, but superfluous; and if we choose we need not admit its beginning. At any rate, Christ speaking of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> says, <q>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew 19:12</a></span> &nbsp;But concerning riches not so, but how? <q>Except a man forsake all that he has, he is not worthy of Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse33">Luke 14:33</a></span> What was easy He recommended, but what goes beyond the many He leaves to choice. Why then do we deprive ourselves of all excuse? The man who is made captive by some more tyrannical passion shall not suffer a heavy punishment, but he who is subdued by a weak one is deprived of all defense. For what shall we reply when He says, <q>You saw Me hungry and fed Me not</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse42">Matthew 25:42</a></span>; what excuse shall we have? We shall certainly plead poverty; yet we are not poorer than that <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, who by throwing in two mites overshot all the rest. For God requires not the quantity of the offering, but the measure of the mind; and that He does so, comes from His tender care. Let us then, admiring His lovingkindness, contribute what is in our power, that having both in this life and in that which is to come obtained in abundance the lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we may be able to enjoy the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things promised to us, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
