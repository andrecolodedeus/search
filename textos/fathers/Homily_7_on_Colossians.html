<h1>Homily 7 on Colossians</h1>

<p class="c12"><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse16">Colossians 2:16-19</a></span> </p>

<p><q>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day, or a new moon, or a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> day: which are a shadow of the things to come; but the body is Christ's. Let no man rob you of your prize by a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> humility and worshiping of the Angels, dwelling in the things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and not holding fast the Head, from whom all the body being supplied and knit together, through the joints and bands, increases with the increase of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>Having first said darkly, <q>Take heed lest there shall be any one that makes spoil of you after the tradition of men</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians 2:8</a></span>; and again, further back, <q>This, I say, that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse4">Colossians 2:4</a></span>; thus preoccupying their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and working in it anxious thoughts; next, having inserted those benefits, and increased this effect, he then brings in his reproof last, and says, <q>Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day, or a new moon, or a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> day.</q> Do you see how he depreciates them? If you have obtained such things, he says, why make yourselves accountable for these petty matters? And he makes light of them, saying, <q>or in the part  of a feast day,</q> for in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> they did not retain the whole of the former rule, <q>or a new moon, or a <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> day.</q> He said not, <q>Do not then observe them,</q> but, <q>let no man judge you.</q> He showed that they were transgressing, and undoing, but he brought his charge against others. Endure not those that judge you, he says, nay, not so much as this either, but he argues with those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, almost stopping their mouths, and saying, You ought not to judge. But he would not have reflected on these. He said not <q>in clean and unclean,</q> nor yet <q>in feasts of Tabernacles, and unleavened bread, and Pentecost,</q> but <q>in part of a feast</q>: for they ventured not to keep the whole; and if they did observe it, yet not so as to celebrate the feast. <q>In part,</q> he says, showing that the greater part is done away. For even if they did keep <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a>, they did not do so with precision. <q>Which are a shadow of the things to come</q>; he means, of the New Covenant; <q>but the body</q> is <q>Christ's.</q> Some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> here punctuate thus, <q>but the body</q> is <q>of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> i.e. the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has come in with Christ: others thus; <q>The Body of Christ let no man adjudge away from you,</q> that is, thwart you of it. The term <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x03C1;&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03C5;&#x03B8;&#x1FC6;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>, is employed when the victory is with one party, and the prize with another, when though a victor you are thwarted.  You stand    above the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; why do you again subject yourself to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Therefore he said that <q>he is a debtor to fulfill the whole law</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse3">Galatians 5:3</a></span>; and again, <q>Is Christ</q> found to be <q>the minister of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse17">Galatians 2:17</a></span>? Which he said when writing to the Galatians. When he had filled them with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> through saying, <q>adjudge away from you,</q> then he begins; <q>being a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>,</q>  he says, <q>in humility and worshiping of Angels, intruding into things he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind.</q> How <q>in humility,</q> or how <q>puffed up</q>? He shows that the whole arose out of vainglory. But what is on the whole the drift of what is said? There are some who maintain that we must be brought near by Angels, not by Christ, that were too great a thing for us. Therefore it is that he turns over and over again what has been done by Christ, <q>through the Blood of His Cross</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse20">Colossians 1:20</a></span>; on this account he says that <q>He suffered for us</q>; that <q>He loved us.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse21">1 Peter 2:21</a></span> And besides in this very same thing, moreover, they were elevated afresh. And he said not <q>introduction by,</q> but <q>worshiping of</q> Angels. <q>Intruding into things he has not  seen.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse4">Ephesians 2:4</a></span> For he has not seen Angels, and yet is affected as though he had. Therefore he says, <q>Puffed up by his fleshly mind vainly,</q> not about any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> fact. About this doctrine, he is puffed up, and puts forward a show of humility. By his carnal <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, not spiritual; his reasoning is of man. <q>And not holding fast the Head,</q> he says, <q>from whom all the body.</q> All the body thence has its being, and its well-being. Why, letting go the Head, do you cling to the members? If you are fallen off from it, you are lost. <q>From whom all the body.</q> Every one, be he who he may, thence has not life only, but also even connection. All the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so long as she holds The Head, increases; because here is no more passion of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and vainglory, nor invention of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> fancy.</p>

<p>Mark that <q>from  whom,</q> meaning the Son. <q>Through the joints and bands,</q> he says, <q>being supplied, and knit together, increases with the increase of God</q>; he means, that which is according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that of the best life.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse20">Ver. 20</a>. <q>If you died with Christ.</q></p>

<p>He puts that in the middle, and on either side, expressions of greater vehemence. <q>If you died with Christ from the elements of the world,</q> he says, <q>why as though living in the world do ye subject yourselves to ordinances?</q> This is not the consequence, for what ought to have been said is, <q>how as though living are you subject to those elements?</q> But letting this pass, what says he?</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ver. 21, 22. <q>Handle not, nor taste, nor touch; all which things are to perish with the using; after the precepts and doctrines of men.</q></p>

<p>You are not in the world, he says, how is it you are subject to its elements? How to its observances? And mark how he makes sport of them, <q>touch not, handle not, taste not,</q> as though they were cowards and keeping themselves clear of some great matters, <q>all which things are to perish with the using.</q> He has taken down the swollenness of the many, and added, <q>after the precepts and doctrines of men.</q> What do you say? Do you speak even of the Law? Henceforth it is but a doctrine of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, after the time has come.  Or, because they adulterated it, or else, he alludes to the Gentile institutions. The doctrine, he says, is altogether of man.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse23">Ver. 23</a>. <q>Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.</q></p>

<p><q>Show,</q> he says; not power, not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. So that even though they have a show of wisdom, let us turn away from them. For he may seem to be a religious person, and modest, and to have a contempt for the body.</p>

<p><q>Not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.</q> For God has given it <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but they use it not with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Thus, when it is a doctrine, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to call it <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. They dishonor the flesh, he says, depriving it, and stripping it of its liberty, not giving leave to rule it with its will. God has <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> the flesh.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse1">Chap. iii. ver. 1</a>. <q>If then you were raised together with Christ.</q></p>

<p>He brings them together, having above established that He died. Therefore he says, <q>If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above.</q> No observances are there. <q>Where Christ is seated on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Wonderful! Whither has he led our minds aloft! How has he filled them with mighty aspiration! It was not enough to say, <q>the things that are above,</q> nor yet, <q>where Christ is,</q> but what? <q>seated on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> From that point he was preparing them henceforward to see the earth.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse2">Ver. 2, 3, 4</a>. <q>Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth. For you died, and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. When Christ who is your life shall be manifested, then shall you also with Him be manifested in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q></p>

<p>This is not your life, he says, it is some other one. He is now urgent to remove them, and insists upon showing that they are seated above, and are dead; from both considerations establishing the position, that they are not to seek the things which are here. For whether ye be dead, you ought not to seek them; or Whether ye be above, you ought not to seek them. Does Christ appear? Neither does your life. It is in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, above. What then? When shall we live? When Christ shall be manifested, who is your life; then seek ye <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, then life, then enjoyment.</p>

<p>This is to prepare the way for drawing them off from pleasure and ease. Such is his wont: when establishing one position, he darts off to another; as, for instance, when discoursing of those who at supper were beforehand with one another, he all at once falls upon the observance of the Mysteries.  For he has a great rebuke when it is administered unsuspected. <q>It is hid,</q> he says, from you. <q>Then shall you also with Him be manifested.</q> So that, now, you do not appear. See how he has removed them into the very heaven. For, as I said, he is always bent upon showing that they have the very same things which Christ has; and through all his Epistles, the tenor is this, to show that in all things they are partakers with Him. Therefore he uses the terms, Head, and Body, and does everything to convey this to them.</p>

<p>If therefore we shall then be manifested, let us not grieve, when we enjoy not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: if this life be not life, but it be hidden, we ought to live this life as though dead. <q>Then shall you also,</q> he says, <q>with Him be manifested in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <q>In <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> he said, not merely <q>manifested.</q> For the pearl too is hidden so long as it is within the oyster. If then we be treated with insult, let us not grieve; or whatever it be we suffer; for this life is not our life, we are strangers and sojourners. <q>For you died,</q> he says. Who is so witless, as for a corpse, dead and buried, either to buy servants, or build houses, or prepare costly raiment? None. Neither then do ye; but as we seek one thing only, namely, that we be not in a naked state, so here too let us seek one thing and no more. Our first man is buried: buried not in earth, but in water; not death-destroyed, but buried by death's destroyer, not by the law of nature, but by the governing command that is stronger than nature. For what has been done by nature, may perchance be undone; but what has been done by His command, never. Nothing is more blessed than this burial, whereat all are rejoicing, both Angels, and men, and the Lord of Angels. At this burial, no need is there of vestments, nor of coffin, nor of anything else of that kind. Would you see the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of this? I will show you a pool wherein the one was buried, the other raised; in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> the Egyptians were sunk beneath it, but the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> went up from out of it; in the same act he buries the one, generates the other.</p>

<p>Marvel not that generation and destruction take place in Baptism; for, tell me, dissolving and cementing, are they not opposite? It is evident to all. Such is the effect of fire; for fire dissolves and destroys wax, but it cements together metallic earth, and works it into gold. So in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> here also, the force of the fire, having obliterated the <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of wax, has displayed a golden one in its stead; for in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> before the Bath we were of clay, but after it of gold. Whence is this evident? Hear him saying, <q>The first man is of the earth, earthy, the second man is the Lord from heaven.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse47">1 Corinthians 15:47</a></span> I spoke of a difference as great as that between clay and gold; but greater still do I find the difference between heavenly and earthy; not so widely do clay and gold differ, as do things earthy and heavenly. Waxen we were, and clay-formed. For the flame of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> did much more melt us, than fire does wax, and any chance <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> did far rather shatter us than a stone does things of clay. And, if you will, let us give an outline of the former life, and see whether all was not earth and water, and full of fluctuation and dust, and instability, and flowing away.</p>

<p>And if you will, let us scrutinize not the former things, but the present, and see whether we shall not find everything that is, mere dust and water. For what will you tell me of? Authority and power? For nothing in this present life is thought to be more enviable than these. But sooner may one find the dust when on the air stationary, than these things; especially now. For to whom are they not under subjection? To those who are lovers of them; to eunuchs; to those who will do anything for the sake of money; to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the populace; to the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of the more powerful. He who was yesterday up high on his tribunal,  who had his heralds shouting with thrilling voice, and many to run before, and haughtily clear the way for him through the forum, is today mean and low, and of all those things bereft and bare, like dust blast-driven, like a stream that has passed by. And like as the dust is raised by our feet, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> are magistracies also produced by those who are engaged about money, and in the whole of life have the rank and condition of feet; and like as the dust when it is raised occupies a large portion of the air, though itself be but a small body, so too does power; and like as the dust blinds the eyes, so too does the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of power bedim the eyes of the understanding.</p>

<p>But what? Will you that we examine that object of many <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>? Come, let us examine it in its several parts. It has luxury, it has <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, it has power. First then, if you will, let us examine luxury. Is it not dust? Yea, rather, it goes by swifter than dust, for the pleasure of luxurious living reaches only to the tongue, and when the belly is filled, not to the tongue even. But, says one, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> are of themselves pleasant things. Yet what can be less pleasant than that same <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, when it is rendered with a view to money? When it is not from free choice and with a readiness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, it is not thou that reapest the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. So that this very thing makes the man of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, most of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, dishonored. For, tell me; suppose all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> you, who had a friend; the while confessing that thou, to be sure, were good for nothing, but that they were compelled to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> you on his account; could they possibly in any other way have so dishonored you? So that our <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of dishonor to us, seeing it is more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> than are its very possessors, and a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> rather of weakness than of power. How then is it not absurd that we are not counted of as much value as earth and ashes, (for such is gold,) but that we are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> for its sake? With reason. But not so he that despises <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; for it were better not to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> at all, than so <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. For tell me, were one to say to you, I think you worthy of no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> at all, but for your servants' sakes I <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> you, could now anything be worse than this dishonor? But if to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> for the sake of servants, who are partakers of the same <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and nature with ourselves, be a disgrace, much more then is it such, to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> for the sake of meaner things, such as the walls and courts of houses, and vessels of gold, and garments. A scorn indeed were this, and shame; better die than be so <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. For, tell me, if you were in peril in this your <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and some low and disgusting person were to be willing to extricate you from your peril, what could be worse than this? What ye say one to another about the city, I wish to say to you. Once on a time our  city gave offense to the Emperor,  and he gave orders that the whole of it should utterly be destroyed, men, children, houses, and all. (For such is the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of kings, they indulge their power as much as ever they choose, so great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is power.) It was then in the extremest of perils. The neighboring city, however, this one on the sea-coast, went and besought the king in our behalf: upon which the inhabitants of our city said that this was worse than if the city had been razed to the ground. So, to be thus <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> is worse than being dishonored. For see whence <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> has its root. The hands of cooks procure us to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, so that to them we ought to feel gratitude; and swineherds supplying us with a rich table, and weavers, and spinners, and workers in metal, and confectioners, and table furnishers.</p>

<p>Were it not then better not to be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> at all, than to be beholden to these for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>? And besides this, moreover, I will endeavor to prove clearly that opulence is a condition full of dishonor; it embases the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and what is more dishonorable than this? For tell me, suppose one had a comely person, and passing all in beauty, and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> were to go to him and promise to make it ugly, and instead of healthy, diseased, instead of cool, inflamed; and having filled every limb with dropsy, were to make the countenance bloated, and distend it all over; and were to swell out the feet, and make them heavier than logs, and to puff up the belly, and make it larger than any tun; and after this, it should promise not even to grant permission to cure him, to those who should be desirous of doing so, (for such is the way with power,) but would give him so much liberty as to punish any one that should approach him to withdraw him from what was harming him; well then, tell me, when <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> works these effects in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, how can it be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a>?</p>

<p>But this power is a more grievous thing than the disease itself; as for one in disease not to be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the physician's injunctions is a more serious <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than the being diseased; and this is the case with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, seeing it creates inflammation in every part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and forbids the physicians to come near it. So let us not felicitate these on the score of their power, but pity them; for neither were I to see a dropsical patient lying, and nobody forbidding him to take his fill of whatever drinks he pleased and of meats that are harmful, would I felicitate him because of his power. For not in all cases is power a good thing, nor are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> either, for these too fill one with much arrogance. But if you would not choose that the body should along with <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> contract such a disease, how do you come to overlook the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and when contracting not this scourge alone, but another also? For it is on fire all over with burning fevers and inflammations, and that burning fever none can quench, for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> will not allow of this, having persuaded it that those things are gains, which are really losses, such as not enduring any one and doing everything at will. For no other <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will one find so replete with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> so great and so extravagant, as theirs who are desirous of being rich. For what silly trifles do they not picture to themselves! One may see these devising more extravagant things than limners of hippocentaurs, and chim&aelig;ras, and dragon-footed things, and Scyllas, and monsters. And if one should choose to give a picture of one <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of theirs, neither Scylla, nor chim&aelig;ra, nor hippocentaur will appear anything at all by the side of such a prodigy; but you will find it to contain every wild beast at once.</p>

<p>And perchance some one will suppose that I have been myself possessed of much <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, seeing I am so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to what really comes of it. It is reported of one (for I will first confirm what I have said from the legends of the Greeks)&mdash; it is reported among them of a certain king, that he became so insolent in luxury, as to make a plane tree of gold,  and a sky above it, and there sate, and this too when invading a people skilled in warfare. Now was not this <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> hippocentaurean, was it not Scyll&aelig;an? Another, again, used  to cast men into a wooden bull. Was not this a very Scylla? And even him,  the king I just mentioned, the warrior,  <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> made, from a man a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, what shall I say? A brute beast, and yet more degraded than this for the beasts, if they lodge under a tree, take up with nature, and seek for nothing further; but the man in question overshot the nature even of beasts.</p>

<p>What then can be more senseless than are the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>? And this arises from the greediness of their desires. But, are there not many that admire him? Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> do they share in the laughter he incurs. That displayed not his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> but his folly. How much better than that golden plane tree is that which the earth produces! For the natural is more grateful than the unnatural. But what meant that your golden heaven, O senseless one? Do you see how <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> that is abundant makes men mad? How it inflamed them? I suppose he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the sea even, and perchance will presently have a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> to walk upon it.  Now is not this a chimaera? Is it not a hippocentaur? But there are, at this time also, some who fall not short even of him, but are actually much more senseless. For in point of senselessness, wherein do they differ, tell me, from that golden plane tree, who make silver jars, pitchers, and scent bottles? And wherein do those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> differ, (ashamed indeed I am, but it is necessary to speak it,) who make chamber utensils of silver?  It is ye should be ashamed, that are the makers of these things. When Christ is famishing, do you so revel in luxury? Yea rather, so play the fool! What punishment shall these not suffer? And do you inquire still, why there are <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>? Why murderers? Why such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? When the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has thus made you ridiculous. For the mere having of silver dishes indeed, this even is not in keeping with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> devoted to wisdom, but is altogether a piece of luxury; but the making unclean vessels also of silver, is this then luxury? Nay, I will not call it luxury, but senselessness; nay, nor yet this, but <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; nay rather, worse than even <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> make jokes at me for this; but I heed them not, only let some good result from it. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> does make people senseless and mad. Did their power reach to such an excess, they would have the earth too of gold, and walls of gold, perchance the heaven too, and the air of gold. What a <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is this, what an iniquity, what a burning fever! Another, made after the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is perishing of cold; and do you furnish yourself with such things as these? O the senseless <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>! What more would a madman have done? Do you pay such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to your excrements, as to receive them in silver? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are shocked at hearing this; but those <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that make such things ought to be shocked, and the husbands that minister to such distempers. For this is wantonness, and savageness, and inhumanity, and brutishness, and lasciviousness. What Scylla, what chim&aelig;ra, what dragon, yea rather what <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, what <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> would have acted on this wise? What is the benefit of Christ? What of the Faith? When one has to put up with men being <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, yea rather, not <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, but <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? If to adorn the head with gold and pearls be not right; one that uses silver for a service so unclean, how shall he obtain pardon? Is not the rest enough, although even it is not bearable, chairs and footstools all of silver? Although even these come of senselessness. But everywhere is excessive <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; everywhere is vainglory. Nowhere is it use, but everywhere excess.</p>

<p>I am afraid lest, under the impulse of this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, the race of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should go on to assume some portentous form: for it is likely that they will wish to have even their hair of gold. Else declare that you were not  at all affected by what was said, nor were excited greatly, and fell a longing, and had not shame withheld you, would not have refused. For if they dare to do what is even more absurd than this, much more, I think, will they long for their hair, and lips, and eyebrows, and every part to be overlaid with molten gold.</p>

<p>But if you are incredulous, and think I am speaking in jest, I will relate what I have heard, or rather what is now existing. The king of the Persians wears his beard golden; those who are adepts at such work winding leaf of gold about his hairs as about the woof, and it is laid up as a prodigy.</p>

<p>Glory to You, O Christ; with how many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things have You filled us! How have You provided for our health! From how great monstrousness, from how great unreasonableness,  have You set us free! Mark! I forewarn you, I advise no longer; but I command and charge; let him that wills, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, and him that wills not, be disobedient; that if you <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> do continue thus to act, I will not suffer it, nor receive you, nor permit you to pass across this threshold. For what need have I of a crowd of distempered people? And what if, in my training of you, I do not forbid what is not  excessive? And yet <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> forbade both gold and pearls. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse9">1 Timothy 2:9</a></span> We are laughed at by the Greeks, our religion appears a fable.</p>

<p>And to the men I give this advice: Are you come to school to be instructed in spiritual <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? Divest yourself of that <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>! This is my advice both to men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and if any act otherwise, henceforward I will not suffer it. The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were but twelve, and hear what Christ says unto them, <q>Would ye also go away?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse67">John 6:67</a></span> For if we go on for ever flattering you, when shall we reclaim you? When shall we do you service? <q>But,</q> says one, <q>there are other <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, and people go over.</q> This is a cold argument, <q>Better is one that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, than ten thousand transgressors.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir016.htm#verse3">Sirach 16:3</a></span> For, what would you choose yourself, tell me; to have ten thousand servants that were runaways and thieves, or a single one that loved you? Lo! I admonish and command you to break up both those gay deckings for the face, and such vessels as I have described, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and not to be so mad.</p>

<p>Let him that likes quit me at once; let him that likes accuse me, I will not suffer it in any one. When I am about to be judged at the Tribunal of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you stand afar off, and your favor, while I am giving in my account. <q>Those words have ruined all! He says,  'let him not  go and transfer himself to another <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>!' Nay! He is weak! condescend to him!</q> To what point? Till when? Once, and twice, and thrice, but not perpetually.</p>

<p>Lo! I charge you again, and protest after the pattern of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, <q>that if I come again I will not spare.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse2">2 Corinthians 13:2</a></span> But when you have done as you ought, then you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how great the gain is, how great the advantage. Yes! I entreat and beseech you, and would not refuse to clasp your knees and supplicate you  in this behalf. What softness is it! What luxury, what wantonness! This is not luxury, but wantonness. What senselessness is it! What <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>! So many poor stand around the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and though the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has so many children, and so <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, she is unable to give relief to even one poor person; <q>but one is hungry, and another is drunken</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse21">1 Corinthians 11:21</a></span>; one voids his excrement even into silver, another has not so much as bread! What <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>! What brutishness so great as this? May we never come to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, whether we will prosecute the disobedient, nor to the indignation which allowing  these practices would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us; but that willingly and with patience we may avoid all this, that we may live to God's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and be delivered from the punishment in the other world, and may obtain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things promised to those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> toward man, etc.</p>
