<h1>Homily 7 on Ephesians</h1>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse8">Chapter III. Verses 8-11</a> </p>

<p><q> <em>Unto me, who am less than the least of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, was this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given, to preach unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the unsearchable riches of Christ; and to make all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> see what is the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, which from all ages has been hid in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who created all things:</em>  <em>to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the manifold wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> purpose, which He purposed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</em></q></p>

<p>They who go to the physician's have not merely to go there and nothing further; they have to learn how to treat themselves, and to apply remedies. And so with us then who come here, we must not do this and nothing else, we must learn our lesson, the surpassing lowliness of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. What? When he was about to speak of the vastness of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hear what he says, <q>Unto me, who am less than the least of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, was this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given.</q> Lowliness indeed it was even to bewail his former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, although blotted out, and to make mention of them, and to hold himself within his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> measure as where he calls himself <q>a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious;</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse13">1 Timothy 1:13</a></span> yet nothing was equal to this: for <q>formerly,</q> says he, such was I; and again he calls himself, <q>one born out of due time.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse8">1 Corinthians 15:8</a></span> But that after so many great and good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and at that time he should thus <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> himself, and call himself <q>less than the least of all,</q> this is indeed great and surpassing moderation. <q>To one who am less than the least of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>;</q> he says not, <q>than the Apostles.</q> So that that expression is less strong than this before us. There his words are, <q>I am not meet to be called an Apostle.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse9">1 Corinthians 15:9</a></span> Here he says that he is even <q>less than the least of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>;</q> <q>to me,</q> says he, <q>who am less than the least of all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> was this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given.</q> What <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? <q>To preach unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the unsearchable riches of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to make all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> see what is the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, which from all ages has been hid in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who created all things, to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places, might be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the manifold wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> True, to man it was not revealed; and are you enlightening Angels and Archangels and Principalities and Powers? I am, says he. For it was <q>hid in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> even <q>in God who created all things.</q> And do you venture to utter this? I do, says he. But whence has this been made manifest to the Angels? By the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Again he says, not merely the manifold (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F77;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) but the much-manifold (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BB;&#x03C5;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x1F77;&#x03BA;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span>) wisdom, that is, <q>the multiplied and varied.</q> What then is this? Did not Angels <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it? No, nothing of it; for if Principalities <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not, much less could Angels ever have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it. What then? Did not even Archangels <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it? No, nor even they. But whence were they going to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it? Who was to reveal it? When we were taught it, then were they also by us.  For hear what the Angel says to Joseph; <q>You shall call His Name Jesus, for it is He that shall save His people from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse21">Matthew 1:21</a></span></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself was sent to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the other Apostles to the Circumcision. So that the more marvellous and astonishing commission was given, says he, <q>to me, who am less than the least.</q> And this too was of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that he that was least should have the greatest things entrusted to him; that he should be made the herald of these tidings. For he that is made a herald of the greater tidings, is in this way great.</p>

<p><q>To preach unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the unsearchable riches  of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>If His <q>riches are unsearchable,</q> and that too after his appearing, much more is His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. If it is still a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, much more was it before it was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; for a <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> he calls it on this account, because neither did the Angels <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, nor was it manifest to any one else.</p>

<p><q>And to make all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> see,</q> says he, <q>what is the dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which from all ages has been hid in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who created all things.</q></p>

<p>Angels <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> only this, that <q>The Lord's portion was His people.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy 32:8-9</a></span> And again it is said, <q>The Prince of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> withstood me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse13">Daniel 10:13</a></span> So that it is nothing to be wondered at that they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this; for if they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the circumstances of the return from the Captivity, much more would they be of these things. For this is the gospel. <q>It is He that shall save,</q> it says, <q>His people.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse21">Matthew 1:21</a></span> Not a word about the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. But what concerns the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the Spirit reveals. That they were called indeed, the Angels <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, but that it was to the same privileges as <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, yea, even to sit upon the throne of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this, who would ever have expected? Who would ever have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>?</p>

<p><q>Which has been hid,</q> says he, <q>in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>This <q>dispensation,</q> however, he more clearly unfolds in the Epistle to the Romans. <q>In <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he continues, <q>who created all things by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q>  And he does well to say <q>by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>;</q> forasmuch as He who created all things by Him, reveals also this by Him; for He has made nothing without Him; for <q>without Him,</q> it is said, <q>was not any thing made.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse30">John 1:30</a></span></p>

<p>In speaking of <q>principalities</q> and <q>powers,</q> he speaks both of those above and those beneath.</p>

<p><q>According to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> purpose.</q> It has been now, he means, brought to pass, but not now decreed, it had been planned beforehand from the very first. <q>According to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> purpose which He purposed  in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>.</q> That is, according to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> foreknowledge; foreknowing the things to come, i.e., he means the ages to come; for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was to be, and thus decreed it. According to the purpose of the ages, of those, perhaps, which He has made by Christ Jesus, because it was by Christ that every thing was made.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse12">Ver. 12</a>. <q>In whom we have,</q> says he, <q>boldness, and access in confidence through our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in him.</q></p>

<p><q>Have access,</q> not as prisoners, he says, nor yet, as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> candidates for pardon, nor as sinners; for, says he, we have even <q>boldness with confidence,</q> that is, accompanied with cheerful trust; arising from what source? <q>through our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse13">Ver. 13</a>. <q>Wherefore  I ask that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which are your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q></p>

<p>How is it <q>for them?</q> How is it <q>their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> It is because God so loved them, as to give even the Son for them, and to afflict His servants for them: for it was in order that they might attain so many blessings, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Surely this was from God's exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards them: it is what God also says concerning the Prophets, <q>I have slain them by the words of my mouth.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/hos006.htm#verse5">Hosea 6:5</a></span> But how was it that they fainted, when another was afflicted? He means, they were troubled, were distressed. This also he says when writing to the Thessalonians, <q>that no man be moved by these afflictions.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th003.htm#verse3">1 Thessalonians 3:3</a></span> For not only ought we not to grieve, but we ought even to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. If you find consolation in the forewarning, we tell you beforehand that here we have tribulation. And why <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>? Because thus has the Lord ordered.</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ver. 14, 15. <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>  I bow my knees unto the Father from whom every <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in heaven and on earth is named.</q></p>

<p>He here shows the spirit of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for them. He does not say simply, <q>I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>,</q> but manifests the supplication to be heartfelt, by the <q>bowing of the knees.</q></p>

<p><q>From whom every <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.</q></p>

<p>That is, no longer, he means, reckoned, according to the number of Angels, but according to Him who has created the tribes both in heaven above and in earth beneath, not as the Jewish.</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ver. 16, 17. <q>That He would grant you according to the riches of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that you may be strengthened with power through His Spirit in the inward man; that Christ may dwell in your hearts through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q></p>

<p>Mark with what insatiable earnestness he invokes these blessings upon them, that they may not be tossed about. But how shall this be effected? By the <q><a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in your inward man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> How again shall this be?</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ver. 18, 19. <q>To the end that you being rooted and grounded in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, may be strong to apprehend with all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth,  and to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ which passes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q></p>

<p>Thus is his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> now again, the very same as when he began. For what were his words in the beginning? <q>That the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may give unto you a Spirit of wisdom and revelation in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him; having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is the hope of His calling, what the riches of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His inheritance in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and what the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</q> And now again he says the same. <q>That ye may be strong to apprehend with all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth;</q> i.e., to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> perfectly the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which has been providentially ordered in our behalf:  <q>and the breadth, and length, and height, and depth;</q> that is, too, the immensity of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how it extends every where. And he outlines it by the visible dimensions of solid bodies, pointing as it were to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. He comprehends the upper and under and sides. I have thus spoken indeed, he would say, yet is it not for any words of mine to teach you these things; that must be the work of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. <q>By His might,</q> says he, is it that you must be <q>strengthened</q> against the trials that await you, and in order to remain unshaken; so that there is no other way to be strengthened but by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, both on account of trials and carnal reasonings.</p>

<p>But how does Christ dwell in the hearts? Hear what Christ Himself says, <q>I and my Father will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John 14:23</a></span> He dwells in those hearts that are faithful, in those that are <q>rooted</q> in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, those that remain firm and unshaken.</p>

<p><q>That ye may be</q> thoroughly <q>strong,</q> says he; so that there is great strength needed.</p>

<p> <q>That ye may be filled unto all the fullness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>What he means is this. Although the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ lies above the reach of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, yet shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, if you shall have Christ dwelling in you, yea, not only shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from Him this, but shall even <q>be filled unto all the fullness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> meaning by the <q>fullness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> either the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> how God is worshipped in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, or else urging them thus to use every effort, in order to be filled with all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, of which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is full.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse20">Ver. 20</a>. <q>Now unto Him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us.</q></p>

<p>That God has done <q>abundantly above all that we ask or think,</q> is evident from what the Apostle himself has written. For I indeed, says he, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, but He of Himself, even without any <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of mine, will do works greater than all we ask, not simply <q>greater,</q> nor <q>abundantly greater,</q> but <q>exceeding abundantly.</q> And this is evident from <q>the power, that works in us:</q> for neither did we ever ask these things, nor did we expect them.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse21">Ver. 21</a>. <q>Unto Him be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> he concludes, <q>in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, unto all generations forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q></p>

<p>Well does he close the discourse with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and doxology; for right were it that He, who has bestowed upon us such vast gifts, should be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> and blessed, so that this is even a proper part of our amazement at His mercies, to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for the things advanced to us at God's hands through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p><q>The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</q> Well might he say this, forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone can last on to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</p>

<p>It seems necessary to state what are meant by <q><a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>.</q> (<span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B1;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x1F77;</span>) Here on earth, indeed there are <q><a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a></q> that is races sprung from one parent stock; but in heaven how can this be, where none is born of another? Surely then, by <q><a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>,</q>  he means either the assemblies and orders of heavenly beings; as also we find it written in Scripture, <q>the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of Amattari:</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1sa010.htm#verse21">1 Samuel 10:21</a>. See <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> or else that it is from Him from whom earthly fathers have their name of father.</p>

<p>However, he does not ask the whole of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but demands of them also <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and not simply <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <q>rooted and grounded,</q> so that neither any blasts can shake it, nor any thing else overturn it. He had said, that <q>tribulations</q> are <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> and if mine are so to you, he would say, much more will your own be: so that to be afflicted is no token of men being forsaken, for He who has wrought so great things for us, never would do this.</p>

<p>Again, if in order to understand the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it was necessary for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and there was need of the indwelling of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who by following mere reasonings shall understand the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Christ? And why is it a difficult thing to learn that God loves us? Beloved, it is extremely difficult. For some <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not even this; wherefore, they even say, numberless <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> come to be in the world; and others <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the extent of this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Nor, indeed, is <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> seeking to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its extent, nor with any view to measure it; for how could he? But only to understand this, that it is transcendent, and great. And this very thing, he says, he is able to show, even from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which has been vouchsafed to us.</p>

<p>However, what is higher than the being <q>strengthened with might,</q> in order to have Christ within? Vast are the things we ask, says he, yet is He able to do above even them, so that not only does He <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us, but does so intensely. Be it our care therefore, beloved, to understand the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A great thing indeed is this; nothing is so beneficial to us, nothing so deeply touches us: more availing this to convince our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> than the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> itself. Whence then shall we understand it? Both from the sources now mentioned, and from the things which happen every day. For from what motive have these things been done for us? From what necessity on His part? None whatever. Over and over again he lays down <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. But the highest degree of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is that where men receive a benefit, without any prior service on their part to call for it.</p>

<p>Moral. And let us then be followers of Him; let us do good to our enemies, to them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, let us draw near to those who turn their backs upon us. This renders us like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you,</q> says Christ, <q>what reward will you have?</q> <q>Do not even the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> the same.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse46">Matthew 5:46</a></span> But what is a sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? To <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you. I wish to give you some example, (pardon me,) and since I find it not among them that are spiritual, I shall quote an instance from them that are without. See ye not those lovers? How many insults are wreaked upon them by their mistresses, how many artifices practised, how many punishments inflicted: yet they are enchained to them, they burn for them, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them better than their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, passing whole nights before their thresholds. From them let us take our example, not indeed to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> such as those&mdash;<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, I mean, that are harlots; no, but thus to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemies. For tell me, do not harlots treat their lovers with greater insolence than all the enemies in the world, and squander away their substance, and cast insult in their face, and impose upon them more servile tasks than upon their own menials? And yet still they desist not, though no one has so great an enemy in any one, as the lover in his mistress. Yea, this beloved one disdains, and reviles, and oftentimes maltreats him, and the more she is loved, the more she scorns him. And what can be more brutal than a spirit like this? Yet notwithstanding he loves her still.</p>

<p>But possibly we shall find <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> like this in spiritual characters also, not in those of our day, (for it has <q>waxed cold,</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew 24:12</a></span> but in those great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> men of old. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the blessed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, surpassed even those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> passion. How, and in what way? First, he gave up the court, and the luxury, and the retinue, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> attending it, and chose rather to be with the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>. Yet is this not only what no one else would ever have done, but would have even been ashamed, were another to have discovered him, of being found to be a kinsman of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who were slaves and not only slaves, but were looked upon as even execrable. Yet was he not only not ashamed of his kindred, but with all his spirit defended them, and threw himself into dangers for their sake. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse24">Acts 7:24</a></span> How? Seeing, it is said, one doing an injury to one of them, he defended him that suffered the injury, and slew him that inflicted it. But this is not as yet for the sake of enemies. Great indeed is this act of itself, but not so great as what comes afterwards. The next day, then, he saw the same thing taking place, and when he saw him whom he had defended  doing his neighbor wrong, he admonished him to desist from his wrong-doing. But he said, with great ingratitude, <q>Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse27">Acts 7:27</a></span> Who would not have taken fire at these words? Had then the former act been that of passion and frenzy, then would he have smitten and killed this man also; for surely he on whose behalf it was done, never would have informed against him. But because they were brethren, it is said, he spoke thus. When he [the Hebrew] was being wronged, he uttered no such word <q>Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</q> <q>Why did you not say this yesterday?</q> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> would say, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and your cruelty, these make me a ruler and a judge.</q></p>

<p>But now, mark, how that some, in fact, say as much even to God Himself. Whenever they are wronged indeed, they would have Him a God of vengeance, and complain of His long suffering; but when themselves do wrong, not for a moment.</p>

<p>However, what could be more bitter than words like these? And yet notwithstanding, after this, when he was sent to that ungrateful, to that thankless race, he went, and shrunk not back. Yea, and after those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and after the wonders wrought by his hand, oftentimes they sought to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> him to death and he escaped out of their hands. They kept murmuring too incessantly, and yet still, notwithstanding, so passionately did he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them, as to say unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when they committed that heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <q>Yet now if You will forgive, forgive their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and if not, blot even me also out of the book which You have written.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse32">Exodus 32:32</a></span> Fain would I perish, says he, with them, rather than without them be saved. Here, verily, is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> even to <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, verily, unbounded <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. What do you say, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Are you regardless of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>? I am, says he, for I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those who have wronged me. Prayest thou to be blotted out? Yea, says he, what can I do, for it is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? And what again after these things? Hear what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says elsewhere; <q>And it went ill with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> for their sakes.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa105.htm#verse32">Psalm 106:32</a></span> How often did they wax wanton? How often did they reject both himself and his brother? How often did they seek to return back to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>? And yet after all these things did he burn, yea, was beside himself with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for them, and was ready to suffer for their sakes.</p>

<p>Thus ought a man to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his enemies; by lamentation, by unwearied endurance, by doing everything, by showing all favor, to aim at their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>And what again, tell me, did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Did he not ask even to be accursed in their stead? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse3">Romans 9:3</a></span> But the great pattern we must of necessity derive from the Lord, for thus does He also Himself, where he says, <q>For He makes His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and the good,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew 5:45</a></span> adducing the example from His Father; but we from Christ Himself. He came unto them, in His Incarnation, I mean, He became a servant for their sakes, <q>He humbled Himself, He emptied Himself, He took the form of a servant.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians 2:7-8</a></span> And when He came unto them, He went not Himself aside <q>into any way of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse5">Matthew 10:5</a></span> and gave the same charge to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and not only so, but <q>He went about healing all manner of disease, and all manner of sickness.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse23">Matthew 4:23</a></span> And what then? All the rest indeed were astonished, and marvelled, and said, <q>Whence, then, has this man all these things?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse56">Matthew 13:56</a></span> But these, the objects of His beneficence, these said, <q>He has a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse20">John 10:20</a></span> and <q>blasphemes,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse36">John 10:36</a></span> and <q>is mad,</q> and is a <q>deceiver,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse12">John 7:12</a> and <a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse63">Matthew 27:63</a></span> Did he therefore cast them away? No, in no wise, but when He heard these sayings, He even yet more signally bestowed His benefits upon them, and went straightway to them that were about to crucify Him, to the intent that He might but only save them. And after He was crucified, what were His words? <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke 23:34</a></span> Both cruelly treated before this, and cruelly treated after this, even to the very latest breath, for them He did every thing, in their behalf He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>. Yea, and after the Cross itself, what did He not do for their sakes? Did He not send Apostles? Did He not work <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>? Did He not shake the whole world?</p>

<p>Thus is it we ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemies, thus to imitate Christ. Thus did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. Stoned, suffering unnumbered cruelties, yet did he all things for their good. Hear his own words. <q>My heart's desire and my supplication to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is for them that they may be saved.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse1">Romans 10:1-2</a></span> And again; <q>For I bear them <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that they have a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for God.</q> And again; <q>If you, being a wild olive tree wast grafted in, how much more shall these be grafted into their own olive tree?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse24">Romans 11:24</a></span> How tender, do you think, must be the affection from which these expressions proceed, how vast the benevolence? It is impossible to express it, impossible.</p>

<p>Thus is it we ought to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemies. This is to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who has enjoined it, Who has given it as His law. To imitate Him is to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemy. Consider it is not your enemy you are benefiting, but yourself; you are not loving him, but art <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> God. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> therefore these things, let us confirm our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one to another, that we may perform this duty perfectly, and attain those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things that are promised in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, with Whom to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, might, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, now, and for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
