<h1>Homily 7 on First Timothy</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 2:2-4</a></strong></p>

<p> <em><q>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. For this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; who wills that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be saved, and come unto the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></em></p>

<p>If in order to put an end to public <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and tumults, and battles, the Priest is exhorted to offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for kings and governors, much more ought private individuals to do it. For there are three very grievous kinds of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The one is public, when our soldiers are attacked by foreign armies: The second is, when even in time of peace, we are at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with one another: The third is, when the individual is at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with himself, which is the worst of all. For foreign <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> will not be able to hurt us greatly. What, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, though it slaughters and cuts us off? It injures not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Neither will the second have power to harm us against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>; for though others be at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with us, we may be peaceable ourselves. For so says the Prophet, <q>For my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they are my adversaries, but I give myself unto <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa108.htm#verse4">Psalm 109:4</a></span>; and again, <q>I was at peace with them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> peace</q>; and, <q>I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa119.htm#verse6">Psalm 120:6-7</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> But from the third, we cannot escape without danger. For when the body is at variance with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and raises up <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, and arms against it sensual pleasures, or the bad <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; we cannot attain the promised blessings, till this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is brought to an end; whoever does not still this tumult, must fall pierced by wounds that will bring that death that is in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. We have daily need therefore of care and great anxiety, that this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> may not be stirred up within us, or that, if stirred up, it may not last, but be quelled and laid asleep. For what advantage is it, that the world enjoys profound peace, if you are at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with yourself? This then is the peace we should keep. If we have it, nothing from without will be able to harm us. And to this end the public peace contributes no little: whence it is said, <q>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life.</q> But if any one is disturbed when there is quiet, he is a miserable creature. Do you see that He speaks of this peace which I call the third kind? Therefore when he has said, <q>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life,</q> he does not stop there, but adds <q>in all godliness and honesty.</q> But we cannot live in godliness and honesty, unless that peace be established. For when curious reasonings disturb our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, what peace is there? Or when spirits of uncleanness, what peace is there?</p>

<p>For that we may not suppose that he speaks of that sort of life which all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> live, when he says, <q>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life,</q> he adds, <q>in all godliness and honesty,</q> since a quiet and peaceable life may be led by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, and profligates, and voluptuous and wanton <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> may be found living such a life. That this cannot be meant, is plain, from what he adds, <q>in all godliness and honesty.</q> Such a life is exposed to snares, and conflicts, and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is daily wounded by the tumults of its own thoughts. But what sort of life he really means is plain from the sequel, and plain too, in that he speaks not simply of godliness, but adds, of <q>all godliness.</q> For in saying this he seems to insist on a godliness not only of doctrine, but such as is supported by life, for in both surely must godliness be required. For of what advantage is it to be godly as to doctrine, but ungodly in life? And that it is very possible to be ungodly in life, hear this same blessed Apostle saying elsewhere, <q>They profess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in works they deny Him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse16">Titus 1:16</a></span> And again, <q>He has denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is worse than an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 5:8</a></span> And, <q>If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, or an idolater</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1 Corinthians 5:11</a></span>, such a man <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> not God. And, <q>He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse9">1 John 2:9</a></span> Such are the various ways of ungodliness. Therefore he says, <q>All godliness and good order.</q>  For not only is the fornicator not honest, but the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man may be called disorderly and intemperate. For <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> is a <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> no less than the bodily appetites, which he who does not chastise, is called dissolute.  For men are called dissolute from not restraining their desires, so that the passionate, the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, the deceitful, and every one that lives in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, may be called dissolute, disorderly, and licentious.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse3">Ver. 3</a>. <q>For this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</q></p>

<p>What is said to be <q>acceptable</q>? The <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. This God accepts, this He wills.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse4">Ver. 4</a>. <q>Who wills that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be saved, and come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<p>Imitate God! If He wills that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be saved, there is reason why one should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all, if He has willed that all should be saved, be thou willing also; and if you wish it, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for it, for wishes lead to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Observe how from every quarter He urges this upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the Heathen, showing how great advantage springs from it; <q>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life</q>; and what is much more than this, that it is pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus men become like Him, in that they will the same that He does. This is enough to shame a very brute. Fear not therefore to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, for God Himself wills it; but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> only to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> against any, for that He wills not. And if you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the Heathens, you ought of course to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for Heretics also, for we are to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and not to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a>.  And this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> also for another reason, as we are partakers of the same nature, and God commands and accepts benevolence and affection towards one another.</p>

<p>But if the Lord Himself wills to give, you say, what need of my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>? It is of great benefit both to them and to yourself. It draws them to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and it inclines you to humanity. It has the power of attracting others to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; (for many men have fallen away from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from contentiousness towards one another;) and this  is what he now calls the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>who will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved</q>; without this all other is nothing great, a mere nominal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,  and only in words. <q>And to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Faith in Him. And indeed he had previously said, <q>Charge some that they teach no other doctrine.</q> But that no one may consider such as enemies, and on that account raise troubles  against them; he says that <q>He wills that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be saved, and come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q>; and having said this, he adds,</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse5">Ver. 5</a>. <q>For there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and one Mediator between God and men.</q></p>

<p>He had before said, <q>to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> implying that the world is not in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Now he says, <q>that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>,</q> that is, not as some say, many, and that He has sent His Son as Mediator, thus giving <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He will have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved. But is not the Son God? Most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> He is; why then does he say, <q>One God</q>? In contradistinction to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; not to the Son. For he is discoursing about <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Now a mediator ought to have communion with both parties, between whom he is to mediate. For this is the property of a mediator, to be in close communion with each of those whose mediator he is. For he would be no longer a mediator, if he were connected with one but separated from the other.  If therefore He partakes not of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He is not a Mediator, but is separated. For as He is partaker of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, because He came to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so is He partaker of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because He came from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because He was to mediate between two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, He must approximate to the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>; for as the place situated between two others is joined to each place, so must that between natures be joined to either nature. As therefore He became Man, so was He also God. A man could not have become a mediator, because he must also plead with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. God could not have been mediator, since those could not receive Him, toward whom He should have mediated. And as elsewhere he says, <q>There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,...and one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse6">1 Corinthians 8:6</a></span>; so also here <q>One</q> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <q>One</q> Mediator; he does not say two; for he would not have that number wrested to Polytheism, of which he was speaking. So he wrote <q>One</q> and <q>One.</q> You see how accurate are the expressions of Scripture! For though one and one are two, we are not to say this, though reason suggests it. And here you say not one and one are two, and yet you say what reason does not suggest. <q>If He begot He also suffered.</q>  <q>For there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>,</q> he says, <q>and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse6">Ver. 6</a>. <q>Who gave Himself a ransom for all to be testified  in due time.</q></p>

<p>Was Christ then a ransom for the Heathen? Undoubtedly Christ died even for Heathen; and you cannot bear to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them. Why then, you ask, did they not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Because they would not: but His part was done. His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">suffering</a> was a <q>Testimony,</q> he says; for He came, it is meant, <q>to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and was slain.  Thus not only the Father bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Him, but He to the Father. <q>For I came,</q> He says, <q>in my Father's name.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse43">John 5:43</a></span> And again, <q>No man has seen God at any time.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John 1:18</a></span> And again, <q>That they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John 17:3</a></span> And, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a Spirit,</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John 4:24</a></span> And He bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> even to the death. But this, <q>in due time,</q> means, In the fittest time.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse7">Ver. 7</a>. <q>Whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an Apostle, (I speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and lie not:) a teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and verity.</q></p>

<p>Since therefore Christ suffered for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and I was separated to be a <q>teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>,</q> why do you refuse to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them? He fully shows his own credibility, by saying that he was <q>ordained</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act013.htm#verse2">Acts 13:2</a></span>, that is, separated, for this purpose, the other Apostles being backward  in teaching the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; he adds, <q>in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and verity,</q> to show that in that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> there was no deceit. Here is observable the extension of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>; but now <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is extended to them: and when he says that he was separated to be a Teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, he intimates that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was now shed over every part of the world.</p>

<p><q>He gave himself a ransom,</q> he says, how then was He delivered up by the Father? Because it was of His goodness. And what means <q>ransom</q>? God was about to punish them, but He forbore to do it. They were about to perish, but in their stead He gave His own Son, and sent us as heralds to proclaim the Cross. These things are sufficient to attract all, and to demonstrate the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <em>Moral</em>. So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, so inexpressibly great are the benefits which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has bestowed upon us. He <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> Himself for His enemies, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> and rejected Him. What no one would do for friends, for brethren, for children, that the Lord has done for His servants; a Lord not Himself such an one as His servants, but God for men; for men not deserving. For had they been deserving, had they done His pleasure, it would have been less wonderful; but that He died for such ungrateful, such obstinate creatures, this it is which strikes every mind with amazement. For what men would not do for their fellow-men, that has God done for us! Yet after such a display of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards us, we hold back,  and are not in earnest in our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He has <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> Himself for us; for Him we make no <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. We neglect Him when He wants necessary food; sick and naked we visit Him not. What do we not deserve, what <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, what punishment, what <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>? Were there no other inducement, it should be sufficient to prevail with every one that He condescended to make <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sufferings His own, to say I hunger, I thirst.</p>

<p>O the tyranny of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>! Or rather the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of those who are its willing slaves! For it has no great power of itself, but through our weakness and servility:  it is we that are mean and groveling, that are carnal and without understanding. For what power has money? It is mute and insensible. If the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirit, that crafty confounder of all things, has no power,  what power has money? When you look upon silver, fancy it is tin! Cannot you? Then hold it for what it really is; for earth it is. But if you cannot reason thus, consider that we too shall perish, that many of those who have possessed it have gained scarce any advantage by it, that thousands who gloried in it are now dust and ashes. That they are suffering extreme punishment, and far more beggarly than they that fed from glass and earthenware; that those who once reclined on ivory couches, are poorer now than those who are lying on the dunghill. But it delights the eyes! How many other things delight them more! The flowers, the pure sky, the firmament, the bright sun, are far more grateful to the eye. For it has much of rust, whence some have asserted that it was black, which appears from the images that turn black. But there is no blackness in the sun, the heaven, the stars. Much greater delight is there in these brilliants  than in its color. It is not therefore its brilliancy  that makes it please, but <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and iniquity; these, and not money, give the pleasure. Cast these from your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and what appeared so precious will seem to you more worthless than clay. Those who are in a fever long for mud when they see it, as if it were spring water; but those in sound health seldom wish even for water. Cast off this morbid longing, and you will see things as they are. And to prove that I do not speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that I can point out many who have done so. Quench this flame, and you will see that these things are of less worth than flowers.</p>

<p>Is gold good? Yes, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for almsgiving, for the relief of the poor; it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, not for unprofitable use, to be hoarded up or buried in the earth, to be worn on the hands or the feet or the head. It was discovered for this end, that with it we should loose the captives, not form it into a chain for the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Use your gold for this, to loose him that is bound, not to chain her that is free. Tell me, why do you value above all things what is of so little worth? Is it the less a chain, because it is of gold? Does the material make any difference?  whether it be gold or iron, it is still a chain; nay the gold is the heavier. What then makes it light, but vainglory, and the pleasure of being seen to wear a chain, of which you ought rather to be ashamed? To make this evident, fasten it, and place the wearer in a wilderness or where there is no one to see, and the chain will at once be felt heavy, and thought burdensome.</p>

<p>Beloved, let us <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest we be doomed to hear those terrible words, <q>Bind him hand and foot.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse13">Matthew 22:13</a></span> And why, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, do you now do so to yourself? No prisoner has both his hands and his feet bound. Why do you bind your head too? For you are not content with hands and feet, but bindest your head and your neck with many chains. I pass over the care that comes of these things, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, the alarm, the strife occasioned by them with your husband if ever he wants them, the death it is to people when they lose any of them. Can you call this a pleasure? To gratify the eyes of others, do you subject yourself to chains, and cares, and perils, and uneasiness, and daily quarrels? This is deserving of every censure and condemnation. Nay, I entreat you, let us not do thus, let us burst every <q>bond of iniquity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse23">Acts 8:23</a></span>; let us break our bread to the hungry, and let us do all other things, which may ensure to us confidence before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may obtain the blessings promised through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, with whom, etc.</p>
