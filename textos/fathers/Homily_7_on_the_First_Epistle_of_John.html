<h1>Homily 7 on the First Epistle of John</h1>

<h2>1 John 4:4-12</h2>

<p><q>Now are you of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, little children, and have overcome him: because greater is He that is in you, than he that is in this world. They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world hears them. We are of God: he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. From this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and [the spirit] of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Dearly, beloved, let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another: for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and every one that loves is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God. He that loves not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for God is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. In this was manifested the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in us, that God sent His only-begotten Son into this world, that we may live through Him. Herein is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, not that we loved, but that He loved us, and sent His Son to be the Atoner  for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Dearly beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another. No man has seen God at any time.</q></p>

<p>1. So is this world to all the faithful seeking their own country, as was the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> to the people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. They wandered indeed as yet, and were seeking their own country: but with God for their guide they could not wander astray. Their way was God's bidding.  For where they went about during forty years, the journey itself is made up of a very few stations, and is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all. They were retarded because they were in training, not because they were forsaken. That therefore which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promises us is ineffable sweetness and a good, <span class="stiki" id="note172352"><a href="../bible/isa064.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;64:4</a></span> as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, and as you have often heard by us rehearsed, which <q>eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has entered into the heart of man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172353"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> But by temporal labors we are exercised, and by <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of this present life are trained. Howbeit, if you would not die of thirst in this wilderness, drink charity. It is the fountain which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has been pleased to place here that we faint not in the way: and we shall more abundantly drink thereof, when we have come to our own land. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> has just been read; now to speak of the very words with which the lesson ended, what other thing heard ye but concerning charity? For we have made an agreement with our God in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that if we would that He should forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, we also should forgive the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which may have been committed against us. <span class="stiki" id="note172354"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> Now that which forgives is none other than charity. Take away charity from the heart; <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> possesses it, it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not how to forgive. Let charity be there, and she fearlessly forgives, not being straitened. And this whole epistle which we have undertaken to expound to you, see whether it commends anything else than this one thing, charity. Nor need we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest by much speaking thereof it come to be hateful. For what is there to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if charity come to be hateful? It is by charity that other things come to be rightly loved; then how must itself be loved! Let not that then which ought never to depart from the heart, depart from the tongue.</p>

<p>2. <q>Now,</q> says he, <q>are you of God little children, and have overcome him:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172355"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:4</a></span> whom but <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>? For above he had said, <q>Whosoever unmakes  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and denies that He has come in the flesh is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Now we expounded, if you remember, that all those who violate charity deny <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> to have come in the flesh. For Jesus had no need to come but because of charity: as indeed the charity we are commending is that which the Lord Himself commends in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than this can no man have, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172357"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;15:13</a></span> How was it possible for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to lay down His life for us without putting on flesh in which He might die? Whosoever therefore violates charity, let him say what he will with his tongue, his life denies that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has come in the flesh; and this is an antichrist, wherever he may be, wherever he have come in. But what says the apostle to them who are citizens of that country for which we sigh? <q>You have overcome him.</q> And whereby have they overcome? <q>Because greater is He that is in you, than he that is in this world.</q> Lest they should attribute the victory to their own strength, and by arrogance of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> should be overcome, (for whomsoever the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> makes <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, he overcomes,) wishing them to keep humility, what says he? <q>You have overcome him.</q> Every man now, at hearing this saying, <q>You have overcome,</q> lifts up the head, lifts up the neck, wishes himself to be praised. Do not extol yourself; see who it is that in you has overcome. Why have you overcome? <q>Because greater is He that is in you, than he that is in the world.</q> Be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, bear your Lord; be the beast for Him to sit on. Good is it for you that He should rule, and He guide. For if you have not Him to sit on you, you may lift up the neck, may strike out the heels: but woe to you without a ruler, for this liberty sends you among the wild beasts to be devoured!</p>

<p>3. <q>These are of the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172358"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:5</a></span> Who? The antichrists. You have already heard who they be. And if you be not such, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, but whosoever is such, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not. <q>These are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world hears them.</q> Who are they that <q>speak of the world</q>? Mark who are against charity. Behold, you have heard the Lord saying, <q>If you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your trespasses. But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172359"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;6:14-15</a></span> It is the sentence of Truth: or if it be not Truth that speaks, gainsay it. If you are a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and believest Christ, He has said, <q>I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> This sentence is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is firm. Now hear men that <q>speak of the world.</q> <q>And will you not avenge yourself? And will you let him say that he has done this to you? Nay: let him feel that he has to do with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> Every day are such things said, They that say such things, <q>of the world speak they, and the world hears them.</q> None say such things but those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, and by none are such things heard but by those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world. And you have heard that to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world and neglect charity is to deny that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> came in the flesh. Or say if the Lord Himself in the flesh did that? If, being buffeted, He willed to be avenged? If, hanging on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, He did not say, <q>Father, forgive them, for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note172360"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> But if He threatened not, who had power; why do you threaten, why are you inflated with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, who art under power of another? He died because it was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to die, yet He threatened not; you know not when you shall die, and do you threaten?</p>

<p>4. <q>We are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172361"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:6</a></span> Let us see why; see whether it be for any other thing than charity. <q>We are of God: he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>:</q> namely by this, that he that hears us has the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; he that hears not us, has the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Let us see what he advises, and let us choose rather to hear him advising in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and not antichrists, not lovers of the world, not the world. If we are born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>beloved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172362"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:7</a></span> he goes on&mdash; see above from what: <q>We are of God: he that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> we the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>:</q> aye, now, he makes us eagerly attentive: to be told that he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hears; but he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not, hears not; and that this is the discerning between the spirit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the spirit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: well then, let us see what he is about to advise; in what we must hear him&mdash; <q>Beloved, let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172363"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:7</a></span> Why? Because a man advises? <q>Because <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Much has he commended <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in that he has said, <q>Is of God:</q> but he is going to say more; let us eagerly hear. At present he has said, <q>Love is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and every one that loves is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> God. He that loves not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172364"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:7-8</a></span> Why? <q>For God is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a></q> [Love is God].  What more could be said, brethren? If nothing were said in praise of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> throughout the pages of this epistle, if nothing whatever throughout the other pages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and this one only thing were all we were told by the voice of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, <q>For Love is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> nothing more ought we to require.</p>

<p>5. Now see that to act against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is to act against God. Let no man say, <q>I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against man when I do not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> my brother, (mark it!) and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against man is a thing to be taken easily; only let me not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against God.</q> How do you not sin against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when you sin against <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? <q>Love is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Do <q>we</q> say this? If we said, <q>Love is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> haply some one of you might be offended and say, What has he said? What meant he to say, that <q>Love is God</q>? God <q>gave</q> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as a gift God bestowed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <q>Love is of God: Love IS God.</q> Look, here have ye, brethren, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> of God: this epistle is canonical; throughout all nations it is recited, it is held by the authority of the whole earth, it has edified the whole earth. You are here told by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, <q>Love is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Now if you dare, go against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and refuse to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your brother!</p>

<p>6. In what sense then was it said a while ago, <q>Love is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and now, <q>Love IS God?</q> For God is Father and Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, God of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and these three, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not three Gods. If the Son be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that person loves in whom dwells the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>: therefore <q>Love is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> but <q>IS <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> because <q>Of God.</q> For you have both in the epistle; both, <q>Love is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and, <q>Love is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Of the Father alone the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> has it not to say, that He is <q>of God:</q> but when you hear that expression, <q>Of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> either the Son is meant, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Because while the apostle says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which is given unto us:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172366"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> let us understand that He who subsists in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For it is even this <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whom the bad cannot receive, even He is that Fountain of which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>Let the fountain of your water be your own, and let no stranger partake with you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172367"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse16">Proverbs&nbsp;5:16-17</a></span> For all who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are strangers, are antichrists. And though they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, they cannot be numbered among the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not to them belongs that Fountain of life. To have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is possible even for a bad man; to have <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is possible even for a bad man. We find that king Saul had <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>: he was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David, yet was he filled with the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and began to prophesy. <span class="stiki" id="note172368"><a href="../bible/1sa019.htm">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;xix</a></span> To receive the sacrament of the body and blood of the Lord is possible even for a bad man: for of such it is said, <q>He that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172369"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> To have the name of Christ is possible even for a bad man; <em>i.e.</em> even a bad man can be called a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>: as they of whom it is said, <q>They polluted the name of their God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172370"><a href="../bible/eze036.htm#verse20">Ezekiel&nbsp;36:20</a></span> I say, to have all these <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> is possible even for a bad man; but to have charity, and to be a bad man, is not possible. This then is the peculiar gift, this the <q>Fountain</q> that is singly one's <q>own.</q> To drink of this the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> exhorts you, to drink of Himself the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> exhorts you.</p>

<p>7. <q>In this was manifested the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172371"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:9</a></span> Behold, in order that we may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we have exhortation. Could we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, unless He first loved us? If we were slow to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, let us not be slow to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in return. He first loved us; not even so do we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. He loved the unrighteous, but He did away the unrighteousness: He loved the unrighteous, but not unto unrighteousness did He gather them together: He loved the sick, but He visited them to make them whole. <q>Love,</q> then, <q>is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>In this was manifested the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in us, because that God sent His only-begotten Son into the world, that we may live through Him.</q> As the Lord Himself says: <q>Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than this can no man have, that a man lay down his life for his friends:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172372"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;15:13</a></span> and there was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ towards us, in that He died for us: how is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father towards us <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>? In that He <q>sent His only Son</q> to die for us: so also the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how has He not with Him also freely given us all things?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172373"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;8:32</a></span> Behold the Father delivered up Christ; Judas delivered Him up; does it not seem as if the thing done were of the same sort? Judas is <q> <em>traditor</em>,</q> one that delivered up, [or, a traitor]: is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father that? God forbid! Do you say. I do not say it, but the apostle says, He that spared not His own Son, but <q> <em>tradidit Eum</em></q> delivered Him up for us all. Both the Father delivered Him up, and He delivered up Himself. The same apostle says: <q>Who loved me, and delivered Himself up for me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172374"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> If the Father delivered up the Son; and the Son delivered up Himself, what has Judas done? There was a <q> <em>traditio</em></q> (delivering up) by the Father; there was a <q> <em>traditio</em></q> by the Son; there was a <q> <em>traditio</em></q> by Judas: the thing done is the same, but what is it that distinguishes the Father delivering up the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Son delivering up Himself, and Judas the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> delivering up his Master? This: that the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> did it in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but Judas did this  in treacherous betrayal. You see that not what the man does is the thing to be considered; but with what mind and will he does it. We find <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father in the same deed in which we find Judas; the Father we bless, Judas we detest. Why do we bless the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and detest Judas? We bless charity, detest iniquity. How great a good was conferred upon <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> by the delivering up of Christ! Had Judas this in his thoughts, that therefore he delivered Him up? God had in His thoughts our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by which we were redeemed; Judas had in his thoughts the price for which he sold the Lord. The Son Himself had in His thoughts the price He gave for us, Judas in his the price he received to sell Him. The diverse intention therefore makes the things done diverse. Though the thing be one, yet if we measure it by the diverse intentions, we find the one a thing to be loved, the other to be condemned; the one we find a thing to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, the other to be detested. Such is the force of charity. See that it alone discriminates, it alone distinguishes the doings of men.</p>

<p>8. This we have said in the case where the things done are similar. In the case where they are diverse, we find a man by charity made fierce;  and by iniquity made winningly gentle. A father beats a boy, and a boy-stealer caresses. If you name the two things, blows and caresses, who would not choose the caresses, and decline the blows? If you mark the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, it is charity that beats, iniquity that caresses. See what we are insisting upon; that the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of men are only discerned by the root of charity. For many things may be done that have a good appearance, and yet proceed not from the root of charity. For thorns also have flowers: some actions <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> seem rough, seem savage; howbeit they are done for discipline at the bidding of charity. Once for all, then, a short precept is given you: Love, and do what you will: whether you hold your peace, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> hold your peace; whether you cry out, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> cry out; whether you correct, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> correct; whether you spare, through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> do you spare: let the root of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> be within, of this root can nothing spring but what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</p>

<p>9. <q>In this is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>&mdash; in this was manifested the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God toward us, because that God sent his only-begotten Son into this world, that we may live through Him.&mdash; In this is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, not that we loved <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that He loved us:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172377"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:9-10</a></span> we did not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him first: for to this end loved He us, that we may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him: And sent His Son to be the Atoner for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: <q> <em>litatorem</em>,</q> <em>i.e.</em> one that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. He <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Where did He find the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>? Where did He find the victim which he would offer pure? Other He found none; His own self He offered. <q>Beloved, if God so loved us we ought also to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another. <span class="stiki" id="note172378"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:11</a></span> Peter,</q> says He, <q>do you love me?</q> And he said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <q>Feed my sheep.</q></p>

<p>10. <q>No man has seen God at any time:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172379"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:12</a></span> He is a thing invisible; not with the eye but with the heart must He be sought. But just as if we wished to see the sun, we should purge the eye of the body; wishing to see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let us purge the eye by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> can be seen. Where is this eye? Hear the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172380"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> But let no man <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> God to himself according to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of his eyes. For so he makes unto himself either a huge form, or a certain incalculable magnitude which, like the light which he sees with the bodily eyes, he makes extend through all directions; field after field of space he gives it all the bigness he can; or, he represents to himself like as it were an old man of venerable form. None of these things do you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>. There is something you may <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, if you would see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> What sort of face has <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? What form has it? What stature? What feet? What hands has it? No man can say. And yet it has feet, for these carry men to church: it has hands; for these reach forth to the poor: it has eyes; for thereby we consider the needy: <q>Blessed is the man,</q> it is said, <q>who considers the needy and the poor.</q>  It has ears, of which the Lord says, <q>He that has ears to hear let him hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172382"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;8:8</a></span> These are not members distinct by place, but with the understanding he that has charity sees the whole at once. Inhabit, and you shall be inhabited; dwell, and you shall be dwelt in. For how say you, my brethren? Who loves what he does not see? Now why, when charity is praised, do ye lift up your hands, make acclaim, praise? What have I shown you? What I produced, was it a gleam of colors? What I propounded, was it gold and silver? Have I dug out jewels from hid treasures? What of this sort have I shown to your eyes? Is my face changed while I speak? I am in the flesh; I am in the same form in which I came forth to you; you are in the same form in which you came hither: charity is praised, and you shout applause. Certainly ye see nothing. But as it pleases you when you praise, so let it please you that you may keep it in your heart. For mark well what I say brethren; I exhort you all, as God enables me, unto a great treasure. If there were shown you a beautiful little vase, embossed,  inlaid with gold, curiously wrought, and it charmed your eyes, and drew towards it the eager desire of your heart, and you were pleased with the hand of the artificer, and the weight of the silver, and the splendor of the metal; would not each one of you say, <q>O, if I had that vase!</q> And to no purpose ye would say it, for it would not rest with you to have it. Or if one should wish to have it, he might think of stealing it from another's house. Charity is praised to you; if it please you, have it, possess it: no need that you should rob any man, no need that you should think of buying it; it is to be had freely, without cost. Take it, clasp it; there is nothing sweeter. If such it be when it is but spoken of, what must it be when one has it?</p>

<p>11. If any of you perchance wish to keep charity, brethren, above all things do not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> it to be an abject and sluggish thing; nor that charity is to be preserved by a sort of gentleness, nay not gentleness, but tameness and listlessness.  Not so is it preserved. Do not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that you then love your servant when you do not beat him, or that you then love your son when you give him not discipline, or that you then love your neighbor when you dost not rebuke him: this is not charity, but mere feebleness. Let charity be fervent to correct, to amend: but if there be good manners, let them delight you; if bad, let them be amended, let them be corrected. Love not in the man his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but the man: for the man God made, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> the man himself made. Love that which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not that which the man himself made. When you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that, you take away this: when you esteem that, you amend this. But even if you be severe  at any time, let it be because of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for correction. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was charity betokened by the Dove which descended upon the Lord.  That likeness of a dove, the likeness in which came the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, by whom charity should be shed forth into us: wherefore was this? The dove has no gall: yet with beak and wings she fights for her young; hers is a fierceness without bitterness. And so does also a father; when he chastises his son, for discipline he chastises him. As I said, the kidnapper, in order that he may sell, inveigles the child with bitter endearments; a father, that he may correct, does without gall chastise. Such be ye to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. See here, brethren, a great lesson, a great rule: each one of you has children, or wishes to have; or if he has altogether determined to have no children after the flesh, at least spiritually he desires to have children:&mdash; what father does not correct his son? What son does not his father discipline? And yet he seems to be fierce  with him. It is the fierceness of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the fierceness of charity: a sort of fierceness without gall after the manner of the dove, not of the raven. Whence it came into my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, my brethren, to tell you, that those violaters of charity are they that have made the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>: as they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> charity itself, so they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> also the dove. But the dove convicts them: it comes forth from heaven, the heavens open, and it abides on the head of the Lord. Wherefore this? That John may hear, <q>This is He that baptizes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note172388"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> Away, you <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>; away, you invaders of the possession of Christ! On your own possessions, where you will needs be lords, you have dared to fix the titles of the great Owner. He recognizes His own titles; He vindicates to Himself His own possession. He does not cancel the titles, but enters in and takes possession. So in one that comes to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not cancelled, that the title of the commander  be not cancelled: but what is done in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? The title is acknowledged; the Owner enters in under His own titles, where the robber was entering in under titles not his own.</p>
