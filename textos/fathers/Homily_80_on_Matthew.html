<h1>Homily 80 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Matthew 26:6-7.</strong></p>

<p><q>Now when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, there came unto Him a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on His head, as He sat at meat.</q></p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> seems indeed to be one and the same with all the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, yet she is not so; but though with the three she does seem to me to be one and the same, yet not so with John, but another person, one much to be admired, the sister of Lazarus.</p>

<p>But not without purpose did the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> mention the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of Simon, but in order that He might show whence the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> took confidence, and came unto Him. For inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> seemed a most unclean disease, and to be abhorred, and yet she saw Jesus had both healed the man (for else He would not have chosen to have tarried with a <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>), and had gone into his house; she grew confident, that He would also easily wipe off the uncleanness of her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And not for nought does He name the city also, Bethany, but that you might learn, that of His own will He comes to His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. For He who before this was fleeing through the midst of them; then, at the time when their <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> was most kindled, comes near within about fifteen furlongs; so completely was His former withdrawing Himself a part of a dispensation.  </p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> therefore having seen Him, and having taken confidence from thence came unto Him. For if she that had the issue of blood, although conscious to herself of nothing like this, yet because of that natural seeming uncleanness, approached Him trembling and in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; much more was it likely this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should be slow, and shrink back because of her <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Wherefore also it is after many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, the Canaanite, her that had the issue of blood, and other besides, that she comes unto Him, being conscious to herself of much impurity; and then not publicly but in a house. And whereas all the others were coming unto Him for the healing of the body alone, she came unto Him by way of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> only, and for the amendment of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For neither was she at all afflicted in body, so that for this most especially one might marvel at her.</p>

<p>And not as to a mere man did she come unto Him; for then she would not have wiped His feet with her hair, but as to one greater than man can be. Therefore that which is the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> member of the whole body, this she laid at Christ's feet, even her own head.</p>

<p><q>But when His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> saw it, they had indignation,</q> such are the words, <q>saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. But when Jesus understood it, He said, Why trouble ye the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? For she has wrought a good work upon me? For you have the poor always with you, but me you have not always. For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has done, be told for a memorial of her.</q>  </p>

<p>And whence had they this thought? They used to hear their Master saying, <q>I will have mercy, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q> and blaming the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, because they omitted the weightier matters, judgment, and mercy, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and discoursing much on the mount concerning almsgiving, and from these things they inferred with themselves, and reasoned, that if He accepts not whole burnt offerings, neither  the ancient worship, much more will He not accept the anointing of oil.</p>

<p>But though they thus thought, He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> her intention suffers her. For indeed great was her reverence, and unspeakable her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; wherefore of this exceeding condescension, He permitted the oil to be poured even on His head.</p>

<p>For if He refused not to become man, and to be borne in the womb, and to be fed at the breast, why do you marvel, if He does not utterly reject this? For like as the Father suffered a savor of meat, and smoke, even so did He the harlot, accepting, as I have already said, her intention. For Jacob too anointed a pillar to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and oil was offered in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> were anointed with ointment.</p>

<p>But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> her purpose found fault unseasonably, and by the things they laid to her charge, they show the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> munificence. For saying, that it might have been sold for three hundred pence, they showed how much this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had spent on the ointment, and how great generosity she had manifested. Wherefore He also rebuked them, saying, <q>Why trouble ye the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>?</q> And He adds a reason, as it was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> again to put them in mind of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, <q>For she did it,</q> He said, <q>for my burial.</q> And another reason. <q>For you have the poor always with you, but me you have not always;</q> and, <q>Wheresoever the gospel shall be preached, that shall be told also which this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> has done.</q></p>

<p>Do you see how again He declares beforehand the going forth unto the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, in this way also consoling them for His death, if after the cross His power was so to shine forth, that the gospel should be spread abroad in every part of the earth.</p>

<p>Who then is so wretched as to set his face against so much <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? For lo! What He said has come to pass, and to whatever part of the earth you may go, you will see her celebrated.</p>

<p>And yet neither was the person that did it distinguished, nor had what was done many witnesses, neither was it in a theatre, but in a house, that it took place, and this a house of some <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> only being present.</p>

<p>2. Who then proclaimed it, and caused it to be spread abroad? It was the power of Him who is speaking these words. And while of countless kings and generals the noble exploits even of those whose memorials remain have sunk into silence; and having overthrown cities, and encompassed them with walls, and set up trophies, and enslaved many nations, they are not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> so much as by hearsay, nor by name, though they have both set up <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, and established <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; yet that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was a harlot poured out oil in the house of some <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>, in the presence of ten men, this all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> celebrate throughout the world; and so great a time has passed, and yet the memory of that which was done has not faded away, but alike Persians and Indians, Scythians and Thracians, and Sarmatians, and the race of the Moors, and they that dwell in the British Islands, spread abroad that which was done secretly in a house by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that had been a harlot.  </p>

<p>Great is the loving-kindness of the Lord. He endures an harlot, an harlot kissing his feet, and moistening them with oil, and wiping them with her hair, and He receives her, and reproves them that blame her. For neither was it right that for so much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should be driven to despair.</p>

<p>But mark thou this too, how far they were now raised up above the world, and forward in almsgiving. And why was it He did not merely say, <q>She has wrought a good work,</q> but before this, <q>Why trouble ye the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>?</q> That they might learn not at the beginning to require too high principles of the weaker sort. Therefore neither does He examine the act merely itself by itself, but taking into account the person of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. And indeed if He had been making a law, He would not have brought in the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but that you might learn that for her sake these things were said, that they might not mar her budding <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but rather cherish it, therefore He says it, teaching us whatever good thing may be done by any man, though it be not quite perfect, to receive it, and encourage it, and advance it, and not to seek all perfection at the beginning. For, that at least He Himself would rather have desired this, is manifest from the fact, that He required a bag to be borne, who had not where to lay His head. But then the time demanded not this, that He should correct the deed, but that He should accept it only. For even as, if any one asked Him, without the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> having done it, He would not have approved this; so, after she had done it, He looks to one thing only, that she be not driven to perplexity by the reproof of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but that she should go from His care, having been made more cheerful and better. For indeed after the oil had been  poured out, their rebuke had no seasonableness.</p>

<p>Do thou then likewise, if you should see any one provide <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> and offer them, and loving to labor upon any other ornament of the church, about its walls or floor; do not command what has been made to be sold, or overthrown, lest you spoil his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. But if, before he had provided them, he were to tell you of it, command it to be given to the poor; forasmuch as He also did this not to spoil the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and as many things as He says, He speaks for her comfort.</p>

<p>Then because He had said, <q>She has done it for my burial;</q> that He might not seem to perplex the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, by making mention of such a thing as this, His burial and death, I mean; see how by that which follows He recovers her, saying, <q>What she has done shall be spoken of in the whole world.</q></p>

<p>And this was at once consolation to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and comfort and praise to her. For all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, He says, shall celebrate her hereafter; and now too has she announced beforehand my passion, by bringing unto me what was needed for a funeral, let not therefore any man reprove her. For I am so far from condemning her as having done amiss, or from blaming her as having not acted rightly, that I will not suffer what has been done to lie hidden, but the world shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which has been done in a house, and in secret. For in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the deed came of a reverential <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and fervent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and a contrite <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>And wherefore did He promise the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> nothing spiritual; but the perpetual memory? From this He is causing her to feel a confidence about the other things also. For if she has wrought a good work, it is quite evident she shall receive a due reward.</p>

<p><q>Then went one of the twelve, he that was called <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas Iscariot</a>, unto the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, and said unto them, What will you give me, and I will deliver Him unto you?</q>  Then. When? When these things were spoken, when He had said, it is for my burial, and not even thereby was he moved to compunction, neither when he heard that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> should be preached everywhere did he <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> (and yet it was the language of unspeakable power), but when <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> showed so much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that had been harlots, then he wrought the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> works.</p>

<p>But what can be the reason they mention his surname? Because there was also another Judas. And they do not shrink from saying, He was of the twelve; so entirely do they hide none of those things which seem to be matters of reproach. And yet they might have said merely this, that he was one of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, for there were others besides. But now they add, of the twelve, as though they had said, of the first company of those selected as the best, of them with Peter and John. Because for one thing did they care, for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> alone, not for concealing what things were done.</p>

<p>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> many of the signs they pass by, but of the things that appear to be matters of reproach they conceal nothing; but though it be word, though it be deed, though it be what you will of this kind, they proclaim it with confidence.</p>

<p>3. And not these only, but even John himself, who utters the higher doctrines. For he most of all tells us of the affronts and the reproachful things that were done unto Him.</p>

<p>And see how great is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of Judas, in that he comes unto them of his own accord, in that he does this for money, and for such a sum of money.</p>

<p>But Luke says, that he conferred with the chief captains.  For after that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> became seditious, the Romans set over them those that should provide for their good order. For their government had now undergone a change according to the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>.</p>

<p>To these then he went and said, <q>What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you. And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray Him.</q>  For indeed he was afraid of the multitude, and desired to seize him alone.</p>

<p>Oh <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>! How did <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> altogether blind him! For he that had often seen Him when He went through the midst, and was not seized, and when He afforded many demonstrations of His Godhead and power, looked to lay hold on Him; and this while He was using like a charm for him so many, both awful and soothing words, to put an end to this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought. For not even at the supper did He forbear from this care of him, but unto the last day discoursed to him of these things. But he profited nothing. Yet not for that did the Lord cease to do His part.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> this, then, let us also not intermit  to do all things unto them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and are remiss, warning, teaching, exhorting, admonishing, advising, though we profit nothing. For Christ indeed foreknew that the traitor was incorrigible, yet nevertheless He ceased not to supply what could be done by Himself, as well admonishing as threatening and bewailing over him, and nowhere plainly, nor openly, but in a concealed way. And at the very time of the betrayal, He allowed him even to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> Him, but this benefited him nothing. So great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, this made him both a traitor, and a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> robber.</p>

<p>Hearken, all you <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, you that have the disease of Judas; hearken, and beware of the calamity. For if he that was with Christ, and wrought signs, and had the benefit of so much instruction, because he was not freed from the disease, was sunk into such a gulf; how much more shall you, who do not so much as listen to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, who are constantly riveted to the things present, become an easy prey to this calamity, unless you have the advantage of constant care. Every day was that man with Him, who had not where to lay His head, and every day was he instructed by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and by words, not to have gold, nor silver, nor two coats; and yet he was not taught self restraint; and how do you expect to escape the disease, if you have not the benefit of earnest attention, and dost not use much diligence? For terrible, terrible is the monster, yet nevertheless, if you be willing, you will easily get the better of him. For the desire is not natural; and this is manifest from them that are free from it. For natural things are common to all; but this desire has its origin from remissness alone; hence it takes its birth, hence it derives its increase, and when it has seized upon those who look greedily after it, it makes them live contrary to nature. For when they regard not their fellow countrymen, their friends, their brethren, in a word all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and with these even themselves, this is to live against nature. Whence it is evident that the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and disease of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, wherein Judas, being entangled, became a traitor, is contrary to nature. And how did he become such a one, you may say, having been called by Christ? Because God's call is not compulsory, neither does it force the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of them who are not minded to choose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but admonishes indeed, and advises, and does and manages all things, so as to persuade men to become good; but if some endure not, it does not compel. But if you would learn from what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> he became such as he was, you will find him to have been ruined by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.</p>

<p>And how was he taken by this calamity? One may say. Because he grew remiss. For hence arise such changes, as on the other hand, those for the better from diligence. How many for instance that were violent, are now more gentle than lambs? How many lascivious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have become afterwards continent? How many, heretofore <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, yet now have cast away even their own possessions? And the contrary again has been the result of remissness. For Gehazi also lived with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, and he too became depraved from the same disease. For this calamity is the most grievous of all. Hence come <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> of tombs, hence menslayers, hence <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and fightings, and whatsoever <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> you may mention, it comes hence. And in every respect is such a one useless, whether it be requisite to lead an army or to guide a people: or rather not in public matters only, but also in private. If he is to marry a wife, he will not take the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but the vilest of all; if he have to buy a house, not that which becomes a free man, but what can bring much rent; if he is to buy slaves, or what else it may be, he will take the worst.</p>

<p>And why do I speak of leading an army, and guiding a people, and managing households; for should he be a king, he is the most wretched of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and a pest to the world, and the poorest of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For he will feel like one of the common sort, not accounting all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> possessions to be his, but himself to be one of all; and when spoiling all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> goods, thinks himself to have less than any. For measuring the things present by his desire for those whereof he is not yet possessed, he will account the former nothing compared to the latter. Wherefore also one says, <q>There is not a more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> thing than a <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202923"><a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse9">Sirach&nbsp;10:9</a></span> </p>

<p>4. For such a one both sets himself to sale, and goes about, a common enemy of the world, grieving that the earth does not bear gold instead of the grain, and the fountains instead of streams, and the mountains instead of stone; vexed at the fruitfulness of the seasons, troubled at common benefits; shunning every means whence one cannot obtain money; undergoing all things whence one can scrape together so much as two farthings; hating all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, the poor and the rich; the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, lest they should come and beg of him; the rich, because he has not their possessions. All men he accounts to be possessed  of what is his, and as though he had been injured by all, so is he displeased with all. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not plenty, he has no experience of satiety, he is more wretched than any, even as, on the other hand, he that is freed from these things, and practises self-restraint, is the most enviable. For the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> man, though he be a servant, though a prisoner, is the most <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For no one shall do him ill, no not though all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should come together out of the world, setting in motion arms and camps, and warring with him. But he that is depraved and vile, and such as we have described, though he be a king, though he have on a thousand diadems, will suffer the utmost extremities, even from a common hand. So feeble is <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, so strong is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>Why then do you mourn, being in a state of poverty. Why do you wail keeping a feast, for indeed it is an occasion of feasting. Why do you weep, for poverty is a festival, if you be wise. Why do you lament, thou little child; for such a one we should call a little child. Did such a person strike you? What is this, he made you more able to endure? But did he take away your money? He has removed the greater part of your burden. But has he cut off your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>? Again you tell me of another kind of freedom. Hear even those without teaching wisdom touching these things, and saying, <q>You have suffered no ill, if you show no regard to it.</q> But has he taken away that great house of yours, which has enclosures about it? But behold the whole earth is before you, the public buildings, whether you would have them for delight, or for use. And what is more pleasing or more beautiful than the firmament of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</p>

<p>How long are you poor and needy? It is not possible for him to be rich, who is not <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; like as it is not possible for him to be poor, who has not the poverty in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. For if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a nobler thing than the body, the less noble parts have not power to affect it after themselves; but the noble part draws over unto herself, and changes those that are not so noble. For so the heart, when it has received any hurt, affects the whole body accordingly; if its temperament be disordered, it mars all, if it be rightly tempered, it profits all. And if any of the remaining parts should have become corrupt, while this remains sound, it easily shakes off what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in them also.</p>

<p>And that I may further make what I say more plain, what is the use, I pray you, of verdant branches, when the root is withering? And what is the harm of the leaves being withered above, while this is sound? So also here there is no use of money, while the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is poor; neither harm from poverty, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is rich. And how can a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, one may say, be rich, being in want of money? Then above all times might this be; for then also is it wont to be rich.</p>

<p>For if, as we have often shown, this is a sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of being rich, to despise <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and to want nothing; and of poverty again, to want, and any one would more easily despise money in poverty than in <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, it is quite evident that to be in poverty rather makes one to be rich. For indeed that the rich man sets his heart on money more than the poor man, is surely plain to every one; like as the drunken man is thirsty, rather than he that has partaken of drink sufficiently. For neither is his desire such as to be quenched by too much; but, on the contrary, it is its nature to be inflamed by this. For fire likewise, when it has received more food, then most of all waxes fierce; and the tyranny of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, when you have cast into it more gold, then most especially is increased.</p>

<p>If then the desiring more be a mark of poverty; and he that is in the possession of riches is like this; he is especially in poverty. Do you see that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> then most of all is poor, when it is rich; and then is rich, when it is in poverty?</p>

<p>And if you will, let us exercise our reasoning in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> also, and let there be two, the one having ten thousand talents, the other ten, and from both let us take away these things. Who then will grieve the most? He that has lost the ten thousand. But he would not have grieved more, unless he had loved it more; but if he loves more, he desires more; but if he desires more, he is more in poverty. For this do we most desire, of which we are most in want, for desire is from want. For where there is satiety, there cannot be desire. For then are we most thirsty, when we have most need of drink.</p>

<p>And all these things have I said, to show that if we be vigilant, no one shall harm us; and that the harm arises not from poverty but from ourselves. Wherefore I beseech you with all diligence to put away the pest of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, that we may both be <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> here, and enjoy the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, unto which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant we may all attain, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
