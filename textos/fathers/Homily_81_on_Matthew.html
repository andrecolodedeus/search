<h1>Homily 81 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Matthew 26:17-18.</strong></p>

<p><q>Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> came to Jesus, saying, Where will You that we prepare for You to eat the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>? And He said, Go into the city to such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and say unto him, The Master says, My time is at hand; I will keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> at your house with My <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q></p>

<p>By the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, he means the day before that feast; for they are accustomed always to reckon the day from the evening, and he makes mention of this in which in the evening the passover must be killed; <span class="stiki" id="note202924"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;13:1</a></span> for on the fifth day of the week they came unto Him. And this one calls the day before the feast of unleavened bread, <span class="stiki" id="note202926"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;22:7</a></span> speaking of the time when they came to Him, and another says on this wise, <q>Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed;</q> by the word <q>came,</q> meaning this, it was near, it was at the doors, making mention plainly of that evening. For they began with the evening, wherefore also each adds, when the passover was killed.</p>

<p>And they say, <q>Where will You that we prepare for You to eat the passover?</q> So even from this it is manifest, that He had no house, no place of sojourning; and I suppose neither had they. For surely they would have entreated him to come there. But neither had they any, having now parted with all things.</p>

<p>But wherefore did He keep the passover? To indicate by all things unto the last day, that He is not opposed to the law.</p>

<p>And for what possible reason does He send them to an unknown person? To show by this also that He might have avoided suffering. For He who prevailed over this man's <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that he received them, and that by words; what would He not have done with them that crucified Him, if it had been His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> not to suffer? And what He did about the ass, this He did here also. For there too He says, <q>If any man say anything unto you, you shall say, that the Lord has need of them;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202928"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;21:3</a></span> and so likewise here, <q>The Master says, I will keep the passover at your house.</q> But I marvel not at this only, that he received Him, being unknown, but that expecting to bring upon himself such enmity and implacable hostility, he despised the enmity of the multitude.</p>

<p>After this, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him not, He gave them a sign, like as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> touching Saul, saying, <q>You shall find one going up and carrying a bottle;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202929"><a href="../bible/1sa010.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;10:3</a></span> and here, <q>carrying a pitcher.</q> And see again the display of his power. For He did not only say, <q>I will keep the passover,</q> but He adds another thing also, <q>My time is at hand.</q> And this He did, at once continually reminding His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the passion, so that exercised by the frequency of the prediction, they should be prepared for what was to take place; and at the same time to show to themselves, and to him that was receiving Him, and to all the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which I have often mentioned, that not involuntarily does He come to His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>. And He adds, <q>with my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>,</q> in order that both the preparation should be sufficient, and that the man should not suppose that He was concealing Himself.</p>

<p><q>Now when the evening had come, He sat down with the twelve <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q>  Oh the shamelessness of Judas! For he too was present there, and came to partake both of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and of the meal, and is convicted at the very table, when although he had been a wild beast, he would have become tame.</p>

<p>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> also signifies, that while they are eating, Christ speaks of His betrayal, that both by the time and by the table he might show the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the traitor.</p> 

<p>For when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had done, as Jesus had appointed them, <q>when the evening had come, He sat down with the twelve.  And as they did eat, He said,</q> we are told, <q>Verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</q>  And before the supper, He had even washed his feet. And see how He spares the traitor. For He said not, such a one shall betray me; but, <q>one of you,</q> so as again to give him power of repentance by concealment. And He chooses to alarm all, for the sake of saving this man. Of you, the twelve, says He, that are everywhere present with me, whose feet I washed, to whom I promised so many things.</p>

<p>Intolerable sorrow thereupon seized that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> company. And John indeed says, they <q>were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and looked one upon another,</q> and each of them asked in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> concerning himself, although conscious to themselves of no such thing. But this <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says, that <q>being exceeding sorrowful, they began every one of them to say unto Him, Is it I, Lord? <span class="stiki" id="note202935"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;26:22</a></span> And He answered and said, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.</q>  </p>

<p>Mark at what time He discovered him. It was when it was His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> to deliver the rest from this trouble, for they were even dead with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, wherefore also they were instant with their questions. But not only as desiring to deliver them from their distress He did this, but also as willing to amend the traitor. For since after having often heard it generally, he continued incorrigible, being past feeling, He being minded to make him feel more, takes off his mask.</p>

<p>For when being sorrowful they began to say, <q>Is it I, Lord? He answered and said, He that dips with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> goes, as it is written of Him, but woe to the man by whom the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is betrayed. It had been good for that man if he had not been born.</q>  </p>

<p>Now some say that he was so bold as not to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> his Master, but to dip with Him: but to me Christ seems to have done this too, to shame him the more, and bring him over to a better disposition. For this act again has something more in it.</p>

<p>2. But these things we ought not to pass by at random, but they should be instilled in our minds, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> would find no place at any time.</p>

<p>For who, bearing in mind that supper, and the traitor sitting at meat with the Saviour of all, and Him who was to be betrayed thus meekly reasoning, would not put away all venom of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>? See at any rate how meekly He conducts Himself towards him, <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> goes, as it is written of Him.</q></p>

<p>And these things again He said, both to restore the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that they might not think the thing was a sign of weakness, and to amend the traitor.</p>

<p><q>But woe unto that man by whom the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he had not been born.</q> See again in His rebukes His unspeakable meekness. For not even here with invective, but more in the way of compassion, does He apply what He says, but in a disguised way again; and yet not his former senselessness only, but his subsequent shamelessness was deserving of the utmost indignation. For after this conviction he says, <q>Is it I, Lord?</q>  Oh insensibility! He inquires, when conscious to himself of such things. For the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> too, marvelling at his boldness, says this. What then says the most mild and gentle Jesus? <q>You say.</q> And yet He might have said, O thou <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>, thou all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> one; accursed, and profane; so long a time in travail with mischief, who hast gone your way, and made satanical compacts, and hast agreed to receive money, and hast been convicted by me too, do you yet dare to ask? But none of these things did He say; but how? <q>You say?</q> fixing for us bounds and rules of long suffering.</p>

<p>But some one will say, Yet if it was written that He was to suffer these things, wherefore is Judas blamed, for he did the things that were written? But not with this intent, but from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For if you inquire not concerning the motive, you will deliver even the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> from the charges against him. But these things are not, they are not so. For both the one and the other are deserving of countless punishments, although the world was saved. For neither did the treason of Judas work out <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for us, but the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the good contrivance of His fair skill, using the wickednesses of others for our advantage.</p>

<p><q>What then,</q> one may say, <q>though Judas had not betrayed Him, would not another have betrayed Him?</q> And what has this to  do with the question? <q>Because if Christ must needs be crucified, it must be by the means of some one, and if by some one, surely by such a person as this. But if all had been good, the dispensation in our behalf had been impeded.</q> Not so. For the Allwise <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how He shall bring about our benefits, even had this happened. For His wisdom is rich in contrivance, and incomprehensible. So for this reason, that no one might suppose that Judas had become a minister of the dispensation, He declares the wretchedness of the man. But some one will say again, <q>And if it had been good if he had never been born, wherefore did He suffer both this man, and all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, to come into the world?</q> When you ought to blame the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, for that having the power not to become such as they are, they have become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, you leave this, and busiest yourself, and art curious about the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; although <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is not by necessity that any one is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</p>

<p><q>But the good only should be born,</q> he would say, <q>and there were no need of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, nor punishment, nor vengeance, nor trace of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> should either not be born at all, or being born should straightway depart.</q></p>

<p>First then, it were well to repeat to you the saying of the apostle, <q>Nay but, O man, who are you that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to Him that formed it, Why have You made me thus?</q>  </p>

<p>But if you still demandest reasons, we would say this, that the good are more admired for being among the bad; because their long-suffering and great self-command is then most shown. But you take away the occasion of their wrestlings, and conflicts, by saying these things. <q>What then, in order that these may appear good, are others punished?</q> says he. God forbid, but for their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For neither because they were brought into the world did they become <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but on account of their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; wherefore also they are punished. For how should they fail to be deserving of punishment, seeing they have so many teachers of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and gain nothing therefrom. For like as the noble and good are worthy of double <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, because they both became good, and took no hurt from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; so also the worthless deserve twofold punishment, both because they became <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, when they might have become good (they show it who have become such), and because they gained nothing from the good.</p>

<p>But let us see what says this wretched man, when convicted by his Master. What then says he? <q>Is it I, Rabbi?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202943"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;26:25</a></span> And why did he not ask this from the beginning? He thought to escape <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by its being said, <q>one of you;</q> but when He had made him manifest, he ventured again to ask, confiding in the clemency of his Master, that He would not convict him.  </p>

<p>3. O blindness! Whereunto has it led him? Such is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, it renders men fools and senseless, yea reckless, and dogs instead of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or rather even more fierce than dogs, and devils after being dogs. This man at least received unto him the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> even when plotting against him, but Jesus, even when doing him good, he betrayed, having already become a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in will. For such does the insatiable desire of gain make men, out of their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, frenzy-smitten, altogether given up to gain, as was the case even with Judas.</p>

<p>But how do Matthew and the other <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> say, that, when he made the agreement touching the treason, then the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> seized him; but John, that <q>after the sop <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> entered into him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202945"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;13:27</a></span> And John himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this, for further back he says, <q>The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> having now put into the heart of Judas, that he should betray Him.</q>  How then does he say, <q>After the sop <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> entered into him?</q> Because he enters not in suddenly, nor at once, but makes much trial first, which accordingly was done here also. For after having tried him in the beginning, and assailed him quietly, after that he saw him prepared to receive him, he thenceforth wholly breathed himself into him, and completely got the better of him.</p>

<p>But how, if they were eating the passover, did they eat it contrary to the law? For they should not have eaten it, sitting down to their meat. <span class="stiki" id="note202947"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;12:11</a></span> What then can be said? That after eating it, they then sat down to the banquet.</p>

<p>But another <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says, that on that evening He not only ate the passover, but also said, <q>With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202948"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;22:15</a></span> that is, on that year. For what reason? Because then the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the world was to be brought about, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> to be delivered, and the subjects of sorrow to be done away with by His death; so welcome was the cross to Him. But nothing softened the savage monster, nor  moved, nor shamed him. He pronounced him wretched, saying, <q>Woe to that man.</q> He alarmed him again, saying, <q>It were good for him if he had not been born.</q> He put him to shame, saying, <q>To whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it.</q> And none of these things checked him, but he was seized by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as by some <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, or rather by a more grievous disease. For indeed this is the more grievous <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>.</p>

<p>For what would the madman do like this? He poured not forth foam out of his mouth but he poured forth the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of his Lord. He distorted not his hands, but stretched them out for the price of precious blood. Wherefore his <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> was greater, because he was mad being in health.</p>

<p>But he does not utter <em>do you say</em>, sounds without meaning. And what is more without meaning than this language. <q>What will you give me, and I will deliver Him unto you?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202949"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;26:15</a></span> <q>I will deliver,</q> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> spoke by that mouth. But he did not smite the ground with his feet struggling? Nay, how much better so to struggle, than thus to stand upright. But do you say, he did not cut himself with stones? Yet how much better, than to do such things as these!</p>

<p>Will ye, that we bring forward the possessed and the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, and make a comparison between the two. But let no one account what is done a reproach to himself. For we do not reproach the nature, but we lament the act. The possessed was never clad with garments, cutting himself with stones, and running, he rushes over rough paths, driven headlong of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Do not these things seem to be dreadful? What then, if I shall show the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> doing more grievous things than these to their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and to such a degree more grievous, that these are considered child's play compared with those. Will you indeed shun the pest? Come then, let us see if they are in any respect in a more tolerable state than they. In none, but even in a more grievous condition; for indeed they are more objects of shame than ten thousand naked <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For it were far better to be naked as to clothing, than being clad with the fruits of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, to go about like them that celebrate the orgies for Bacchus. For like as they have on madmen's masks and clothes, so have these also. And much as the nakedness of the possessed is caused by <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, so does <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> produce this clothing, and the clothing is more miserable than the nakedness.</p>

<p>And this I will hereby endeavor to prove. For whom should we say was more mad, among madmen themselves; one who should cut himself, or one who together with himself should hurt those who met him? It is quite clear that it is this last. The madmen then strip themselves of their clothing, but these all that meet them. <q>But these tear their clothes to pieces.</q> And how readily would every one of those that are injured consent that his garment should be torn, rather than be stripped of all his substance?</p>

<p><q>But those do not aim blows at the face.</q> In the first place, the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> do even this, and if not all, yet do all inflict by famine and penury more grievous pains on the belly.</p>

<p><q>But those bite not with the teeth.</q> Would that it were with teeth, and not with the darts of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> fiercer than teeth. <q>For their teeth are weapons and darts.</q>  For who will feel most pained, he that was bitten once, and straightway healed, or he that is for ever eaten up by the teeth of penury? For penury when involuntary is more grievous than furnace or wild beast.</p>

<p><q>But those rush not into the deserts like the possessed of devils.</q> Would it were the deserts, and not the cities, that they overran, and so all in the cities enjoyed security. For now in this respect again, they are more intolerable than all the insane, because they do in the cities these things which the others do in the deserts, making the cities deserts, and like as in a desert, where there is none to hinder, so plundering the goods of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<p><q>But they do not pelt with stones them that meet them.</q> And what is this? Of stones it were easy to beware; but of the wounds which by paper and ink they work to the wretched poor (framing writings full of blows without number), who, out of those that fall in with them, can ever easily beware?</p>

<p>4. And let us see also what they do to themselves. They walk naked up and down the city, for they have no garment of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. But if this does not seem to them to be a disgrace, this again is of their exceeding <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, for that they have no feeling of the unseemliness, but while they are ashamed of having their body naked, they bear about the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> naked, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in it. And if you wish, I will tell you also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their insensibility. What then is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? They are naked among many that are thus naked, wherefore neither are they ashamed, like as neither are we in the baths. So that if indeed there were many clothed with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, then would their shame appear more. But  now this above all is a worthy subject for many tears, that because the bad are many, bad things are not even esteemed as a disgrace. For besides the rest, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has brought about this too, not to allow them to obtain even a sense of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>, but by the multitude of them that practise <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, to throw a shade over their disgrace; since if it came to pass that he was in the midst of a multitude of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> practising self-restraint, such a one would see his nakedness more.</p>

<p>That they are more naked than the possessed is evident from these things; and that they go into the deserts, neither this again could any one gainsay. For the wide and broad way is more desert than any desert. For though it have many that journey on it, yet none from among men, but serpents, scorpions, wolves, adders, and asps. Such are they that practise <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. And this way is not only desert, but much more rugged than that <em>of the mad</em>. And this is hereby evident. For stones and ravines and crags do not so wound those that mount them, as <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that practise them.</p>

<p>And that they live by the tombs, like the possessed, or rather that they themselves are tombs, is plain by this. What is a tomb? A stone having a dead body lying in it. Wherein then do these men's bodies differ from those stones? Or rather, they are more miserable even than they. For it is not a stone containing a dead body, but a body more insensible than stones, bearing about a dead <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Wherefore one would not be wrong in calling them tombs. For so did our Lord too call the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for this reason most especially; He went on at least to say, <q>Their inward parts are full of ravening and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>.</q>  </p>

<p>Would ye that I show next, how they also cut their heads with stones? Whence then first, I pray you, will you learn this? From the things here, or from the things to come? But of the things to come they have not much regard; we must speak then of the things here. For are not anxieties more grievous than many stones, not wounding heads, but consuming a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For they are afraid, lest those things should <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> go forth out of their house, which have come unto them <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>; they tremble in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the utmost ills, are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, are provoked, against those of their own house, against strangers; and now despondency, now <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, now <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, comes upon them in succession, and they are as if they were crossing precipice after precipice, and they are earnestly looking day by day for what they have not yet acquired. Wherefore neither do they feel pleasure in the things they have, both by reason of not feeling confidence about the security of them, and because with their whole mind they are intent upon what they have not yet seized. And like as one continually thirsting, though he should drink up ten thousand fountains, feels not the pleasure, because he is not satisfied; so also these, so far from feeling pleasure, are even tormented, the more they heap around themselves; from their not feeling any limit to such desire.</p>

<p>And things here are like this; but let us speak also of the day to come. For though they give not heed, yet it is necessary for us to speak. In the day to come then, one will see everywhere such men as these undergoing punishment. For when He says, <q>I was an hungered, and you gave me no meat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202952"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse42">Matthew&nbsp;25:42</a></span> He is punishing these; and when He says, <q>Depart into the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> He is sending there them that make a bad use of riches. And the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> servant, who gives not to his fellow-servants the goods of his Lord, is of the number of these men, and he that buried his talent, and the five <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.</p>

<p>And wherever you shall go, you will see the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> punished. And now they will hear, <q>There is a void between us and you;</q> now, <q>Depart from me into the fire that is prepared.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202954"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> And now being cut asunder, they will go away, where there is gnashing of teeth, and from every place one may see them driven, and finding a place nowhere, but gathered in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> alone.</p>

<p>5. What then is the use of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> to us for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when we hear these things? There, gnashing of teeth, and outer darkness, and the fire prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and to be cut asunder, and to be driven away; here, enmities, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speakings, <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>, perils, cares, plots, to be <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of all, to be abhorred of all, even of the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> that seem to flatter us. For as good men are admired not by the good only but even by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; so bad men, not the good only, but also the worthless, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>. And in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, I would gladly ask of the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, whether they do not feel painfully one toward another; and account such more their enemies than those that have done them the greatest wrong; whether they do not also accuse themselves, whether they do not account the thing  an affront, if any one brings this reproach upon them. For indeed this is an extreme reproach, and a sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of much <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; for if you dost not endure to despise <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, of what will you ever get the better? Of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, or of the mad desire of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>? And how would any be persuaded of it? For as to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, many impute it even to the temperament of the flesh, and to this do students of medicine refer the excesses thereof; and him that is of a more hot and languid temperament, they affirm to be more lustful; but him that runs out into a drier kind of ill temperament, eager, and irritable, and wrathful. But with respect to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, no one ever heard of their having said any such thing. So entirely is the pest the effect of mere remissness, and of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> past feeling.</p>

<p>Therefore, I beseech you, let us give diligence to amend all such things, and to give an opposite direction to the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> that come upon us in every age. But if in every part of our life we sail past the labors of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, everywhere undergoing shipwrecks; when we have arrived at the harbor destitute of spiritual freight, we shall undergo extreme punishment. For our present life is an outstretched ocean. And as in the sea here, there are different bays exposed to different tempests, and the &AElig;gean is difficult because of the winds, the Tyrrhenian strait because of the confined space, the Charybdis that is by Africa because of the shallows, the Propontis, which is without the Euxine sea, on account of its <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and currents, the parts without Cadiz because of the desolation, and tracklessness, and unexplored places therein, and other portions for other causes; so also is it in our life.</p>

<p>And the first sea to view is that of our childish days, having much tempestuousness, because of its folly, its facility, because it is not steadfast. Therefore also we set over it guides and teachers, by our diligence adding what is wanting to nature, even as there by the pilot's skill.</p>

<p>After this age succeeds the sea of the youth, where the winds are violent as in the &AElig;gean, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> increasing upon us. And this age especially is destitute of correction; not only because he is beset more fiercely, but also because his faults are not reproved, for both teacher and guide after that withdraw. When therefore the winds blow more fiercely, and the pilot is more feeble, and there is no helper, consider the greatness of the tempest.</p>

<p>After this there is again another period of life, that of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in which the cares of the household press upon us, when there is a wife, and marriage, and begetting of children, and ruling of a house, and thick falling showers of cares. Then especially both <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> flourishes and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>.</p>

<p>When then we pass each part of our life with shipwrecks, how shall we suffice for the present life? How shall we escape future punishment. For when first in the earliest age we learn nothing healthful, and then in youth we do not practise sobriety, and when grown to manhood do not get the better of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, coming to old age as to a hold full of bilgewater, and as having made the barque of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> weak by all these shocks, the planks being separated, we shall arrive at that harbor, bearing much filth instead of spiritual merchandise, and to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> we shall furnish laughter, but lamentation to ourselves, and bring upon ourselves the intolerable punishments.</p>

<p>That these things may not be, let us brace ourselves up on every side, and, withstanding all our <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, let us cast out the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, that we may also attain unto the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> forever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
