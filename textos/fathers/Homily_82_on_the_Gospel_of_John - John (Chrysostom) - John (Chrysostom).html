<h1>Homily 82 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 17:14</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>I have given them Your word; and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</q></div>

<p>1. When having become <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> we are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, or when being desirous of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> we are mocked at by them, let us not be distracted or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. For this is the natural course of things, and everywhere <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is wont to engender <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men. For envying those who desire to live properly, and thinking to prepare an excuse for themselves if they can overthrow the credit of others, they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them as having pursuits opposite to their own, and use every means to shame their way of life. But let not us grieve, for this is a mark of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore Christ also says, <q>If you were of the world, the world would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> its own.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse19">John 15:19</a></span> And in another place again, <q>Woe unto you when all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> shall speak well of you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse26">Luke 6:26</a></span> Wherefore also He says here, <q>I have given them Your word, and the world has <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> them.</q> Again He tells the reason for which they were worthy to obtain much care from the Father; <q>For Your sake,</q> He says, <q>they have been <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, and for Your word's sake</q>; so that they would be entitled to all <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> care.</p>

<h2>John 17:15</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>I pray not that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil.</q></div>

<p>Again He simplifies  His language; again He renders it more clear; which is the act of one  showing, by making entreaty for them with exactness, nothing else but this, that He has a very tender care for them. Yet He Himself had told them, that the Father would do all things whatsoever they should ask. How then does He here <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them? As I said, for no other purpose than to show His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<h2>John 17:16</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</q></div>

<p>How then says He in another place, <q>Which You gave Me out of the world; Yours they were</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse6">John 17:6</a></span> There He speaks of their nature; here of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> actions. And He puts together a long encomium of them; first, that <q>they were not of the world</q>; then, that <q>the Father Himself had given them</q>; and that <q>they had kept His word;</q> and that on this account <q>they were <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>.</q> And if He says, <q>As I am not of the world,</q> be not troubled; for the <q>as</q> is not here expressive of unvarying exactness. For as, when in the case of Him and the Father the <q>as</q> is used, a great Equality is signified, because of the Relationship in Nature; so when it is used of us and Him, the interval is great, because of the great and <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> interval between the respective natures. For if He <q>did no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, neither was guile found in His mouth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse22">1 Peter 2:22</a></span>, how could the Apostles be reckoned equal to Him? What is it then that He says, <q>They are not of the world</q>? <q>They look to another world, they have nothing common with earth, but have become citizens of heaven.</q> And by these words He shows His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, when He commends them to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and commits them to Him who begot Him. When He says, <q>Keep them,</q> He does not speak merely of delivering them from dangers, but also with regard to their continuance in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Wherefore He adds,</p>

<h2>John 17:17</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Sanctify them through Your truth.</q> <q>Make them holy by the gift of the Spirit, and of right doctrines.</q> As when He says, <q>You are clean through the word which I spoke unto you</q> <span class="stiki"> <a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse3">John 15:3</span>, so now He says the same thing, <q>Instruct them, teach them the truth.</q> <q>And yet He says that the Spirit does this. How then does He now ask it from the Father?</q> That you may again learn their equality of Honor. For right doctrines asserted concerning God sanctify the soul. And if He says that they are sanctified by the word, marvel not. And to show that He speaks of doctrines, He adds,</div>

<p><q>Your word is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<p>That is, <q>there is no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in it, and all that is said in it must needs come to pass</q>; and again, it signifies nothing typical or bodily. As also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that He has sanctified it by the Word. For the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is wont also to cleanse. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians 5:26</a></span> Moreover, the, <q>sanctify them,</q> seems to me to signify something else, such as this, <q>Set them apart for the Word and for preaching.</q> And this is made plain from what follows. For, He says,</p>

<h2>John 17:17</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>As You have sent Me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</q></div>

<p>As <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also says, <q>Having put in us the word of reconciliation.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2 Corinthians 5:19</a></span> For the same end for which Christ came, for the same did these take possession of the world. In this place again the <q>as</q> is not put to signify resemblance in the case of Himself and the Apostles; for how was it possible for men to be sent otherwise? But it was His custom to speak of the future as having come to pass. </p>

<h2>John 17:19</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be sanctified in the truth.</q></div>

<p>What is, <q>I sanctify Myself</q>? <q>I offer to You a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</q> Now all <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> are called <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,</q> and those are specially called <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things,</q> which are laid up for God. For whereas of old in type the sanctification was by the sheep, but now it is not  in type, but by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, He therefore says, <q>That they may be sanctified in Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <q>For I both dedicate them to You, and make them an offering</q>; this He says, either because their Head was being made so,  or because they also were <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>; for, <q>Present,</q> it says, <q>your bodies a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans 12:1</a></span>; and, <q>We were counted as sheep for the slaughter.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa043.htm#verse22">Psalm 43:22</a></span> And He makes them; without death, a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and offering; for that He alluded to His own <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, when He said, <q>I sanctify,</q> is clear from what follows.</p>

<h2>John 17:20</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also who shall believe.</q> </div>

<p>2. For since He was dying for them, and said, that <q>For their sakes I sanctify Myself,</q> lest any one should think that He did this for the Apostles only, He added, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> I for these only, but for them also who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me through their word.</q> By this again He revived their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, showing that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should be many. For because He made common what they possessed peculiarly, He comforts them by showing that they were being made the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others.</p>

<p>After having thus spoken concerning their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and their being sanctified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the Sacrifice, He afterwards speaks of concord, and finally closes his discourse with this, having begun with it and ended  in it. For at  the beginning He says, <q>A new commandment I give unto you</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John 13:34</a></span>; and here,</p>

<h2>John 17:21</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>That they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me and I in You.</q></div>

<p>Here again the <q>as</q> does not denote exact similarity in their case, (for it was not possible for them in so great a degree,) but only as far as was possible for men. Just as when He says <q>Be merciful, as your Father.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse36">Luke 6:36</a></span></p>

<p>But what is, <q>In Us</q>?  In the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is on Us. Because nothing so offends all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as divisions, He provides that they should be one. <q>What then,</q> says some one, <q>did He effect this?</q> Certainly He effected it. For all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> through the Apostles are one, though some from among them were torn away. Nor did this escape His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, He even foretold it, and showed that it proceeded from men's slack-mindedness.</p>

<p><q>That the world may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that You have sent Me.</q></p>

<p>As He said in the beginning, <q>By this shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are My <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> And how should they hence <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? <q>Because,</q> He says, <q>You are a God of peace.</q> If therefore they observe the same as those of whom they have learned, their hearers shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the teacher by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, but if they quarrel, men shall deny that they are the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of a God of peace, and will not allow that I, not being peaceable, have been sent from You. Do you see how, unto the end, He proves His unanimity with the Father?</p>

<h2>John 17:22</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And the glory which You gave Me, I have given them.</q> </div>

<p>That by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, that by doctrines,  and, that they should be of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; for this is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that they should be one, and greater even than <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. As men  admire God because there is no strife or discord in That Nature, and this is His greatest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <q>so too let these,</q> He says, <q>from this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> become <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</q> <q>And how,</q> says some one, <q>does He ask the Father to give this to them, when He says that He Himself gives it?</q> Whether His discourse be concerning <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, or unanimity, or peace, He is seen Himself to have given these things to them; whence it is clear that the petition is made for the sake of their comfort.</p>

<h2>John 17:23</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>I in them, and You in Me.</q></div>

<p><q>How gave He the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</q> By being in them, and having the Father with Him, so as to weld them  together. But in another place He speaks not so; He says not that the Father comes by Him, but, <q>that He and the Father come, and take up their abode with him,</q>  <q>there</q> removing the suspicion of Sabellius, <q>here</q> that of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. </p>

<p><q>That they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You have sent Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse23">John 14:23</a></span></p>

<p>He says these latter words immediately after the other, to show that peace has more power to attract men than a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>; for as it is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of strife  to separate, so it is that of agreement to weld together.</p>

<p><q>And I have  loved them as You have loved Me.</q></p>

<p>Here again the <q>as</q> means, as far as it is possible for a man to be loved; and the sure <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is His giving Himself for them. After having told them that they shall be in safety, that they shall not be overturned, that they shall be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, that many shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> through them, that they shall enjoy great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that not He alone loved them, but the Father also; He next tells them of what shall be after their sojourning here,  concerning the prizes and crowns laid up for them.</p>

<h2>John 17:24</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>Father, I will that they also whom You have given Me, be with Me where I am.</q></div>

<p><q>Then dost Thou gain by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and dost Thou not yet possess that concerning which they enquired continually, saying, 'Where are You going?' What sayest Thou? How then did You say to them, 'You shall sit upon twelve thrones'? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew 19:28</a></span> How did You promise other things more and greater?</q> Do you see that He says all  in the way of condescension? Since how would He have said, <q>You shall follow afterwards</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse36">John 13:36</a></span> But He speaks thus with a view to a fuller conviction and demonstration of His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p><q>That they may behold My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which You have given Me.</q></p>

<p>This again is a sign of His being of one mind with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of a higher character than those former, for He says, <q>Before  the foundation of the world,</q> yet has it also a certain condescension; for, <q>You have given Me,</q> He says. Now if this be not the case, I would gladly ask the gainsayers a question. He that gives, gives to one subsisting;  did the Father then, having first begotten the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, afterwards give Him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, having before allowed Him to be without <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>? And how could this be reasonable? Seest that the <q>He gave,</q> is, <q>He begot</q>?</p>

<p>3. But why said He not, <q>That they may share My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> instead of, <q>That they may be  hold My <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q>? Here He implies, that all that rest is, the looking on the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. This certainly it is which causes them to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>; as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>With open face mirroring the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2 Corinthians 3:18</a></span> For as they who look on the sunbeams, and enjoy a very clear atmosphere, draw their enjoyment from their sight, so then also, and in much greater degree, this will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us pleasure.  At the same time also He shows, that what they should behold was not the body then seen, but some awful Substance.</p>

<h2>John 17:25</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>O righteous Father, the world has not known You.</q> </div>

<p>What means this? What connection has it? He here shows that no man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, save those only who have come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Son. And what He says is of this kind: <q>I wished all to be so,  yet they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> You, although they had no complaint against You.</q> For this is the meaning of, <q>O righteous Father.</q> And here He seems to me to speak these words, as vexed that they would not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> One so just and good. For since the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had said that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not, at this He aims, saying, <q>For You <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">loved</a> Me before the foundation of the world</q>; thus putting together a defense against the accusations of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For how could He who had received <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, who was loved before the foundation of the world, who desired to have them as witnesses of that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, how could He be opposed to the Father? <q>This then is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say, that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, and that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You not; on the contrary, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You, and they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> You.</q></p>

<p><q>And these have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that You have sent Me.</q></p>

<p>Do you see that He alludes to those, who said that He was not from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all is finally summed up to meet this argument?</p>

<h2>John 17:26</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>And I have declared unto them Your Name, and will declare it.</q></div>

<p><q>Yet you say that perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is from the Spirit.</q> <q>But the things of the Spirit are Mine.</q></p>

<p><q>That the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith You have loved Me may remain  in them, and I in them.</q></p>

<p><q>For if they learn who You are, then they shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am not separated from You, but one of the greatly beloved, and a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Son, and closely knit to You. And those who are rightly persuaded of this, will keep both the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is on Me and perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and while they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> as they ought, I remain in them.</q> Do you see how He has arrived  at a good end, finishing off the discourse with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the mother of all blessings?</p>

<p>4. Let us then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that it may not be said of us, <q>They profess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in their works they deny Him.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse16">Titus 1:16</a></span> And again, <q>He has denied the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is worse than an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 5:8</a></span> For when he  helps his domestics and kinsmen and strangers, while thou dost not even succor those who are related to you by <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, what will henceforth be your excuse, when God is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> and insulted by reason of you? Consider what opportunities of doing good God has given to us. <q>Have mercy on one,</q> He says, <q>as a kinsman, on another as a friend, on another as a neighbor, on another as a citizen, on another as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> And if none of these things hold you, but you break through all bonds, hear from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that you are <q>worse than an <a href="../cathen/08002b.htm">infidel</a></q>; for he having heard nothing of almsgiving, or of heavenly things, has overshot you in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for man; but thou who art bidden to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your very enemies, lookest upon your friends as enemies, and art more careful of your money than of their bodies. Yet the money by being spent will sustain no injury, but your brother if neglected will perish. What <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> then to be careful of money, and careless about one's kindred? Whence has this craving for riches burst in upon us?  Whence this inhumanity and cruelty? For if any one could, as though seated on the highest bench of a theater, look down upon all the world&mdash;or rather, if you will, let us for the present take in hand a single city&mdash;if then a man seated on an elevated spot could take in at a glance all the doings of the men there, consider what folly he would condemn, what tears he would weep, what laughter he would laugh, with what <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> he would <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>; for we commit such actions as deserve both laughter, and the charge of folly, and tears, and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. One man keeps dogs to catch  brute animals, himself sinking into brutality; another keeps oxen and asses to transport stones, but neglects men wasting with hunger; and spends gold without limit to make men of stone, but neglects real men, who are becoming like stones through their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> state. Another, collecting with great pains golden quarries,  puts them about his walls, but when he beholds the naked bellies of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, is not moved.  Some again contrive garments over their very garments, while their brother has not even wherewithal to cover his naked body. Again, one has swallowed up another in the  law-courts; another has spent his money on <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and parasites, another on stage-players and theatrical bands,  another on splendid edifices, on purchases of fields and houses. Again, one man is counting interest, another interest of interest; another is putting together  bands full of many deaths, and does not enjoy rest even at night, lying awake for others' harm. Then, when it is day, they run, one to his <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> gain, another to his wanton expense, others to public <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>.  And great is the earnestness about things superfluous and forbidden, but of things necessary no account is taken; and they who decide questions of law have indeed the name of jurymen, but are really  thieves and murderers. And if one should enquire into law suits and wills, he would find there again ten thousand mischiefs, frauds, robberies, plots, and about these things is all time spent; but for spiritual things there is no care, and they all inconvenience the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for the sake of seeing only. But this is not what is required; we need works, and a pure mind.  But if you spend all the day in grasping after riches, and then coming in sayest a few words, you have not only not propitiated <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but hast even angered Him more. Would you conciliate your Lord, exhibit works, make yourself acquainted with the mass of woes, look upon the naked, the hungry, the wronged; He has cut out for you ten thousand ways of showing <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for men. Let us not then deceive ourselves by living aimlessly and to no purpose, nor presume, because we now are in health; but bearing in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that often when we have fallen into sickness, and have reached the extreme of debility, we have been dead with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and the looking for things to come, let us expect to fall again into the same state, let us get again the same <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and let us become better men; since what is done now deserves <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> condemnation. For those in the courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> are like lions and dogs; those in the public places like foxes; and those who lead a life of leisure, even they do not use their leisure as they ought, spending all their time on theaters and the mischiefs arising from them. And there is no one to reprove what is being done; but there are many who <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, and are vexed that they are not in the like condition,  so that these in their turn are punished, though not actually doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things. For they <q>not only do these things, but also have pleasure in them that do them.</q> Because what belongs to their will is alike  corrupt; whence it is plain, that the intention also will be punished. These things I say each day, and I will not cease to say them. For if any listen, it is gain; but if none give heed, you shall then hear these things, when it will avail you nothing, and you shall blame yourselves, and we shall be flee from fault. But may it never come to pass that we should only have this excuse, but that you may be our boast before the judgment-seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that together we may enjoy the blessings, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
