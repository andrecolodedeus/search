<h1>Homily 83 on Matthew</h1>

<p><strong><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse36">Matt. XXVI. 36-38</a>.</strong></p>

<p> <em><q>Then comes Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and says unto the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Sit ye here, while I go and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> yonder. And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy: and He says unto them, My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here, and watch with me.</q></em>  </p>

<p>Because they clung to Him inseparably, therefore He says, <q>Tarry ye here, while I go away and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.</q> For it was usual with Him to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> apart from them. And this He did teaching us in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, to prepare silence for ourselves and great retirement.</p>

<p>And He takes with Him the three, and says unto them, <q>my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death.</q> Wherefore does He not take all with Him? That they might not be cast down; but these He takes that had been spectators of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. However, even these He dismisses: <q>And He went on a little farther, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, saying, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as You will. And He comes unto them, and finds them sleeping, and says unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</q>  </p>

<p>Not without reason does He inveigh against Peter most, although the others also had slept; but to make him feel by this also, for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which I mentioned before. Then because the others also said the same thing (for when Peter had said (these are the words), <q>Though I must die with You, I will not deny You; likewise also,</q> it is added, <q>said all the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a></q>); <span class="stiki" id="note202991"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;26:36</a></span> He addresses Himself to all, convicting their weakness. For they who are desiring to die with Him, were not then able so much as to sorrow with Him wakefully, but sleep overcame them.</p>

<p>And He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> with earnestness, in order that the thing might not seem to be acting. And sweats flow over him for the same <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> again, even that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> might not say this, that He acts the agony. Therefore there is a sweat like drops of blood, and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appeared strengthening Him, and a thousand sure signs of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest any one should affirm the words to be feigned. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> also was this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. By saying then, <q>If it be possible, let it pass from me,</q> He showed His humanity; but by saying, <q>Nevertheless not as I will, but as You will,</q> He showed His <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and self-command, teaching us even when nature pulls us back, to follow God. For since it was not enough for the foolish to show His face only, He uses words also. Again, words sufficed not alone, but <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> likewise were needed; these also He joins with the words, that even they who are in a high degree contentious may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, that He both became man and died. For if, even when these things are so, this be still disbelieved by some, much more, if these had not been. See by how many things He shows the reality of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>: by what He speaks, by what He suffers. After that He comes and says to Peter, as it is said, <q>What, couldest thou not watch one hour with me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202992"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse37">Mark&nbsp;14:37</a></span> All were sleeping, and He re  bukes Peter, hinting at him, in what He spoke. And the words, <q>with me,</q> are not employed without reason; it is as though He had said, You could not watch with me one hour, and will you lay down your life for me? And what follows also, intimates this self-same thing. For <q>Watch,</q> says He, <q>and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not to enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> See how He is again instructing them not to be self-confident, but contrite in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and to be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, and to refer all to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>And at one time He addresses Himself to Peter, at another to all in common. And to him He says, <q>Simon, Simon, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for you;</q> and to all in common, <q>Pray that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>;</q> every way plucking up their self-will, and making them earnest-minded. Then, that He might not seem to make His language altogether condemnatory, He says, <q>The spirit indeed is ready, but the flesh is weak.</q> For even although thou dost desire to despise death, yet you will not be able, until God stretch forth His hand, for the carnal mind draws down.</p>

<p>And again He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> in the same way, saying, <q>Father, if this cannot pass from me except I drink it, Your will be done,</q> showing here, that He fully harmonizes with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and that we must always follow this, and seek after it.</p>

<p><q>And He came and found them asleep.</q>  For besides that it was late at night, their eyes also were weighed down by their despondency. And the third time He went and spoke the same thing, establishing the fact, that He was become man. For the second and third time is in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> especially indicative of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; like as Joseph also said to <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, <q>Did the dream appear to you the second time? For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was this done, and that you might be assured that this shall surely be.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202995"><a href="../bible/gen041.htm#verse32">Genesis&nbsp;41:32</a></span> Therefore He too once, and twice, and three times spoke the same thing, for the sake of proving the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>.  </p>

<p>And wherefore came He the second time? In order to reprove them, for that they were so drowned in despondency, as not to have any sense even of His presence. He did not however reprove them, but stood apart from them a little, showing their unspeakable weakness, that not even when they had been rebuked, were they able to endure. But He does not awake and rebuke them again, lest He should smite them that were already smitten, but He went away and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and when He has come back again, He says, <q>Sleep on now, and take your rest.</q> And yet then there was need to be wakeful, but to show that they will not bear so much as the sight of the dangers, but will be put to flight and desert Him from their terror, and that He has no need of their succor, and that He must by all means be delivered up, <q>Sleep on now,</q> He says, <q>and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202997"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;26:45</a></span> </p>

<p>He shows again that what is done belongs to a divine dispensation.</p>

<p>2. But He does not this only, but also, by saying, <q>into the hands of sinners,</q> He cheers up their minds, showing it was the effect of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, not of His being liable to any charge.</p>

<p><q>Rise, let us be going; behold, he is at hand that does betray me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202998"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;26:46</a></span> For by all means He taught them, that the matter was not of necessity, nor of weakness, but of some secret dispensation. For, as we see, He foreknew that Judas would come, and so far from flying, He even went to meet him. At any rate, <q>While He yet spoke, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and elders of the people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note202999"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse47">Matthew&nbsp;26:47</a></span> Seemly surely are the instruments of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>! <q>with swords and staves</q> do they come against Him! And Judas, it is said, with them, one of the twelve. Again he calls him <q>of the twelve,</q> and is not ashamed. Now he that betrayed Him gave them a sign, saying, <q>Whomsoever I shall <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, that same is He, hold Him fast.</q>  Oh! What depravity had the traitor's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> received. For with what kind of eyes did he then look at his Master? With what mouth did he <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> Him? Oh! accursed purpose; what did he devise? What did he dare? What sort of sign of betrayal did he give? Whomsoever I shall <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, he says. He was emboldened by his Master's gentleness, which more than all was sufficient to shame him, and to deprive him of all excuse for that he was betraying one so meek.</p>

<p>But wherefore does He say this? Because often when seized by them He had gone out through the midst, without their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it. Nevertheless, then also this would have been done, if it had not been His own will that He should be taken. It was at least with a view to teach them this, that He then blinded their eyes, and Himself asked, <q>Whom do you seek?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note203001"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;18:4</a></span> And they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not, though being with  lanterns and torches, and having Judas with them. Afterwards, as they had said, <q>Jesus;</q> He says, <q>I am He</q> whom you seek: and here again, <q>Friend, wherefore are you come?</q>  </p>

<p>For after having shown His own strength, then at once He yielded Himself. But John says, that even to the very moment He continued to reprove him, saying, <q>Judas, do you betray the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note203003"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;22:48</a></span> Are you not ashamed even of the form of the betrayal? Says He. Nevertheless, forasmuch as not even this checked him, He submitted to be kissed, and gave Himself up willingly; and they laid their hands on Him, and seized Him that night on which they ate the passover, to such a degree did they boil with rage, and were mad. However, they would have had no strength, unless He had Himself suffered it. Yet this delivers not Judas from intolerable punishment, but even more exceedingly condemns him, for that though he had received such <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His power, and lenity, and meekness, and gentleness, he became fiercer than any wild beast.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> then these things, let us flee from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. For that, that it was, which then drove him to <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; that exercises them who are taken thereby in the most extreme cruelty and inhumanity. For, when it makes them to despair of their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, much more does it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to overlook that of the rest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. And so tyrannical is the passing, as sometimes to prevail over the keenest <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Wherefore indeed I am exceedingly ashamed, that to spare their money, may indeed have bridled their unchastity, but for the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Christ they were not willing to live chastely and with gravity.</p>

<p>Wherefore I say, let us flee from it; for I will not cease for ever saying this. For why, O man, do you gather gold? Why do you make your bondage more bitter? Why your watching more grievous? Why your anxiety more painful? Account for your own the metals buried in the mines, those in the kings' courts. For indeed if you had all that heap, you would keep it only, and wouldest not use it. For if now you have not used the things you possess, but abstainest from them as though they belonged to others, much more would this be the case with you, if you had more. For it is the way of the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, the more they heap up around them, the more to be sparing of it. <q>But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> do you say, <q>that these things are mine.</q> The possession then is in supposition only, not in enjoyment. But I should be an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, do you say. Nay, but you would by this become a more easy prey both to rich and poor, to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and false accusers, and servants, and in general to all that are minded to plot against you. For if you are desirous to be an object of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, cut off the occasions by which they are able to lay hold of you and pain you, whoever have set their hearts thereon. Do you not hear the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> that says, that the poor and naked man, not even a hundred men gathered together are ever able to strip? For he has his poverty as his greatest protection, which not even the king shall ever be able to subdue and take.</p>

<p>3. The <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man indeed all join in vexing. And why do I say men, when moths and worms <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against such a man? And why do I speak of moths? Length of time is enough alone, even when no one troubles him, to do the greatest injury to such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</p>

<p>What then is the pleasure of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>? For I see its discomforts, but do thou tell me the pleasure of it. And what are its discomforts? Do you say: anxieties, plots, enmities, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; to be ever thirsting and in pain.</p>

<p>For if any one were to embrace a damsel he loves, but were not able to satisfy his desire, he undergoes the utmost torment. Even so also does the rich man. For he has plenty, and is with her, but cannot satisfy all his desire; but the same result takes place as some wise man mentions; <q>The <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of eunuch to deflower a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>;</q> and, <q>Like an eunuch embracing a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> and groaning;</q> so are all the rich.</p>

<p>Why should one speak of the other things? How such a one is displeasing to all, to his servants, his laborers, his neighbors, to them that handle public affairs, to them that are injured, to them that are not injured, to his wife most of all, and to his children more than to any. For not as men does he bring them up, but more miserably than menials and purchased slaves.</p>

<p>And countless occasions for <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and vexation, and insult, and ridicule against himself, does he bring about, being set forth as a common laughing stock to all. So the discomforts are these, and perhaps more than these; before one could never go through them all in discourse, but experience will be able to set them before us.</p>

<p>But tell me the pleasure from hence. <q>I appear to be rich,</q> he says, <q>and am reputed to be rich.</q> And what kind of pleas  ure to be so reputed? It is a very great name for <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. I say a name, for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is a name only void of reality.</p>

<p><q>Yet he that is rich,</q> says he, <q>indulges and delights himself with this notion.</q> He delights himself in those things about which he ought to grieve. <q>To grieve? Wherefore?</q> asks he. Because this renders him useless for all purposes, and cowardly and unmanly both with regard to banishment and to death, for he holds this double, longing more for money than for light. Such a one not even <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> delights, because it bears not gold; nor the sun, forasmuch as it puts not forth golden beams.</p>

<p>But there are some, says he, who do enjoy what they possess, living in luxury, in <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, in <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, spending sumptuously. You are telling me of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> worse than the first. For the last above all are the men, who have no enjoyment. For the first at least abstains from other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, being bound to one <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but the others are worse than these, besides what we have said, bringing in upon themselves a crowd of cruel masters, and doing service every day to the belly, to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, to <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, to other kinds of intemperance, as to so many cruel tyrants, keeping harlots, preparing expensive feasts, purchasing parasites, flatterers, turning aside after unnatural <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, involving their body and their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in a thousand diseases springing therefrom.</p>

<p>For neither is it on what they want they spend their goods, but on ruining the body, and on ruining also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> therewith; and they do the same, as if any one, when adorning his person, were to think he was spending his money on his own wants.</p>

<p>So that he alone enjoys pleasure and is master of his goods, who uses his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> for a proper object; but these are slaves and captives, for they aggravate both the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of the body and the diseases of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. What manner of enjoyment is this, where is siege and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and a storm worse than all the raging of the sea? For if <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> find men fools, it renders them more foolish; if wanton, more wanton.</p>

<p>And what is the use of understanding, you will say, to the poor man? As might be expected you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; for neither does the blind man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is the advantage of light. Listen to Solomon, saying, <q>As far as light excels darkness, so does wisdom excel folly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note203005"><a href="../bible/ecc002.htm#verse13">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;2:13</a></span> </p>

<p>But how shall we instruct him that is in darkness? For the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> is darkness, permitting nothing that is to appear as it is, but otherwise. For much as one in darkness, though he should see a golden vessel, though a precious stone, though purple garments, supposes them to be nothing, for he sees not their beauty; so also he that is in <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not as he ought the beauty of those things that are worthy of our care. Disperse then I pray you the mist that arises from this passion, and then will you see the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of things.</p>

<p>But nowhere do these things so plainly appear as in poverty, nowhere are those things so disproved which seem to be, and are not, as in self-denial.</p>

<p>4. But oh! Foolish men; who do even curse the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and say that both houses and living are disgraced by poverty, confounding all things. For what is a disgrace to a house? I pray you. It has no couch of ivory, nor silver vessels, but all of earthenware and wood. Nay, this is the greatest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and distinction to a house. For to be indifferent about worldly things, often occasions all a man's leisure to be spent in the care of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>When therefore you see great care about outward things, then be ashamed at the great unseemliness. For the houses of them that are rich most of all want seemliness. For when you see tables covered with hangings, and couches inlaid with silver, much as in the theatre, much as in the display of the stage, what can be equal to this unseemliness? For what kind of house is most like the stage, and the things on the stage? The rich man's or the poor man's? Is it not quite plain that it is the rich man's? This therefore is full of unseemliness. What kind of house is most like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a>? It is quite evident that it is the poor man's. This therefore is most adorned, and to be approved. And that you may learn that this is, above all, a house's adorning, enter into the house of Zacch&aelig;us, and learn, when Christ was on the point of entering therein, how Zacch&aelig;us adorned it. For he did not run to his neighbors begging curtains, and seats, and chairs made of ivory, neither did he bring forth from his closets Laconian hangings; but he adorned it with an adorning suitable to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. What was this? <q>The half of my goods I will give,</q> he says, <q>to the poor; and whomsoever I have <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a>, I will restore fourfold.</q>  On this wise let us too adorn our houses, that Christ may enter in unto us also. These are the fair curtains, these are wrought in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, they are woven there. Where these are, there is also the King of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. But if you  adorn it in another way, you are inviting the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his company.</p>

<p>He came also into the house of the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> Matthew. What then did this man also do? He first adorned himself by his readiness, and by his leaving all, and following Christ.</p>

<p>So also Cornelius adorned his house with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>; wherefore even unto this day it shines above the very palace. For the vile state of a house is not in vessels lying in disorder, nor in an untidy bed, nor in walls covered with smoke, but in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of them that dwell therein. And Christ shows it, for into such a house, if the inhabitant be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, He is not ashamed to enter; but into that other, though it have a golden roof, He will never enter. So that while this one is more gorgeous than the palace, receiving the Lord of all, that with its golden roof and columns is like filthy drains and sewers, for it contains the vessels of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>But these things we have spoken not of those who are rich for a useful purpose, but of the grasping, and the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>. For neither is there among these, diligence nor care about the things needful, but about pampering the belly, and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and other like unseemliness; but with the others about self-restraint. Therefore nowhere did Christ enter into a gorgeous house, but into that of the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> and chief <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>, and fisherman, leaving the kings' palaces, and them that are clothed with soft raiment.</p>

<p>If then thou also desirest to invite Him, deck your house with <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, with supplications, with <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>. These are the decorations of Christ the King, but those of <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, the enemy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Let no one be ashamed then of a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> house, if it has this furniture; let no rich man <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> himself on having a costly house, but let him rather hide his face, and seek after this other, forsaking that, that both here he may receive Christ, and there enjoy the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> tabernacles, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards man of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
