<h1>Homily 8 on Second Timothy</h1>

<p class="c12"><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse1">2 Timothy 3:1-4</a></span> </p>

<p><q>This <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, boasters, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, disobedient to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, unthankful, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>, without natural affection, truce-breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, Traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>If any now takes offense at the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, let him remember that it was so from the beginning, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> always setting up <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by the side of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. God from the beginning promised good, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> came too with a promise. God planted Paradise, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> deceived, saying, <q>You shall be as gods.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis 3:5</a></span> For as he could show nothing in actions, he made the more promises in words. Such is the character of deceivers. After this were Cain and Abel, then the sons of Seth and the daughters of men; afterwards Ham and Japhet, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, Jacob and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>; and so it is even to the end, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the magicians, the Prophets and the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, the Apostles and the false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, Christ and <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>. Thus it was then, both before and at that time. Then there was Theudas, then Simon, then were the Apostles, then too this party of Hermogenes and Philetus. In short, there was no time when <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> was not set up in opposition to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Let us not therefore be distressed. That it would be so, was foretold from the beginning. Therefore he says, <q>Know that in the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, boasters, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, disobedient to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, unthankful, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>, without natural affection.</q> The unthankful then is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>, and this is natural, for what will he be to others, who is not grateful to his benefactor? The unthankful man is a truce-breaker, he is without natural affection.</p>

<p><q>False accusers,</q> that is, slanderers. For those who are conscious that they have no good in themselves, while they commit many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and offenses, find consolation in defaming the characters of others.</p>

<p><q>Incontinent,</q> with respect both to their tongue and their appetite, and everything else.</p>

<p><q>Fierce,</q> hence their inhumanity and cruelty, when any one is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, selfish, ungrateful, licentious.</p>

<p><q>Despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady.</q> <q>Traitors,</q> betrayers of friendship; <q>heady,</q> having no steadiness; <q>high-minded,</q> filled with arrogance. <q>Lovers of pleasures more than lovers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse5">Ver. 5</a>. <q>Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.</q></p>

<p>In the Epistle to the Romans, he says somewhat on this wise, <q>Having the form of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the law</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse20">Romans 2:20</a></span>, where he speaks in commendation of it: but here he speaks of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beyond all other defects. And why is this? Because he does not use the words in the same signification. For an image is often taken to signify a likeness; but sometimes a thing without life, and worthless. Thus he says himself in his Epistle to the Corinthians, <q>A man ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse7">1 Corinthians 11:7</a></span> But the Prophet says, <q>Man walks in an image.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa038.htm#verse9">Psalm 39:9</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> And the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> sometimes takes a lion to represent royalty, as, <q>He couched as a lion, and as a lion's cub, who shall raise him up?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse9">Genesis 49:9</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> And sometimes to signify rapacity, as, <q>a ravening and a roaring lion.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa021.htm#verse13">Psalm 22:13</a></span> And we ourselves do the same. For as things are compounded and varied in themselves, they are fitly adduced for various images and examples. As when we would express our admiration of a beautiful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, we say, she is like a picture; and when we admire a painting, we say that it speaks, that it breathes. But we do not mean to express the same thing, but in one case to mark likeness, in the other beauty. So here with respect to form, in the one passage, it means a model, or representation, a doctrine, or pattern of godliness; in the other, something that is lifeless, a mere appearance, show, and hypocrisy. Faith therefore, without works, is fitly called a mere form without the power. For as a fair and florid body, when it has no strength, is like a painted figure, so is a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> apart from works. For let us suppose any one to be <q><a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, a traitor, heady,</q> and yet to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> aright; of what advantage is it, if he wants all the qualities becoming a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, if he does not the works that characterize godliness, but outdoes the Greeks in impiety, when he is a mischief to those with whom he associates, causes God to be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, and the doctrine to be <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> by his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>?</p>

<p><q>From such turn away,</q> he says. But how is this, if men are to be so <q>in the latter times</q>? There were probably then such, in some degree at least, though not to the same excess. But, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, through him he warns all to turn away from such characters.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse6">Ver. 6</a>. <q>For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, led away with various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse7">Ver. 7</a>. <q>Ever learning, and never able to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<p>Do you see them employing the artifice of that old deceiver, the weapons which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> used against Adam? <q>Entering into houses,</q> he says. Observe how he shows their impudence by this expression,  their dishonorable ways, their deceitfulness. <q>Leading captive silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>,</q> so that he who is easy to be deceived is a <q>silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> and nothing like a man: for to be deceived is the part of silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <q>Laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> See whence arises their persuasion, from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, from their being conscious to themselves of nothing good! And with great propriety has he said <q>laden.</q>  For this expression marks the multitude of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and their state of disorder and confusion; <q>led away with various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> He does not accuse nature, for it is not <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> simply, but such <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as these, that he blames. And why <q>various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a></q>? By that are implied their various faults, their luxury, their disorderly conduct, their wantonness. <q>Divers <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>,</q> he says, that is, of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, of pleasure, of self-will, of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>: and perchance other vile desires are implied.</p>

<p><q>Ever learning, and never able to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> He does not say thus to excuse, but to threaten them severely; for their understanding was callous, because they had weighed themselves down with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse8">Ver. 8</a>. <q>Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, so do these also resist the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q></p>

<p>Who are these?  The magicians in the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. But how is it their names are nowhere else introduced? Either they were handed down by tradition, or it is probable that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them by inspiration.</p>

<p><q>Men of corrupt minds,</q> he says, <q>reprobate concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse9">Ver. 9</a>. <q>But they shall proceed no further; for their folly shall be manifested unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as theirs also was.</q></p>

<p><q>They shall proceed no further</q>; how then does he say elsewhere, <q>They will increase unto more ungodliness</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse16">2 Timothy 2:16</a></span> He there means, that beginning to innovate and to deceive, they will not pause in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but will always invent new deceits and corrupt doctrines, for <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is never stationary. But here he says, that they shall not be able to deceive, nor carry men away with them, for however at first they may seem to impose upon them, they will soon and easily be detected. For that he is speaking to this effect appears from what follows. <q>For their folly shall be manifest unto all.</q> Whence? Every way&mdash; <q>as theirs also was.</q> For if <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> flourish at first, they do not continue to the end, for so it is with things that are not fair by nature, but fair in appearance; they flourish for a time, and then are detected, and come to nought. But not such are our doctrines, and of these you are a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, for in our doctrines there is no deceit, for who would choose to die for a deceit?</p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse10">Ver. 10</a>. <q>But you have fully <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>  my doctrine.</q> Wherefore be strong; for thou were not merely present, but followed closely. Here he seems to imply that the period had been long, in that he says, <q>You have followed up my doctrine</q>; this refers to his discourse. <q>Manner of life</q>; this to his conduct. <q>Purpose</q>; this to his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and the firmness of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. I did not say these things, he says, and not do them; nor was I a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> in words only. <q>Faith, longsuffering.</q> He means, how none of these things troubled me. <q>Charity,</q> which those men had not; <q>patience,</q> nor yet this. Towards the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, he means, I show much longsuffering; <q>patience,</q> that under <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse11">Ver. 11</a>. <q>Persecutions, afflictions.</q></p>

<p>There are two things that disquiet a teacher, the number of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and men's wanting <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to endure sufferings. And yet he has  said much about these, that such always have been, and always will be, and no age will be free from them, and that they will not be able to injure us, and that in the world there are vessels of gold and of silver. You see how he proceeds to discourse about his afflictions, <q>which came upon me at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, at Iconium, at Lystra.</q></p>

<p>Why has he selected these instances out of many? Because the rest was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Timothy, and these perhaps were new events, and he does not mention the former ones, for he is not enumerating them particularly, for he is not actuated by ambition or vainglory, but he recounts them for the consolation of his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, not from ostentation. And here he speaks of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> in Pisidia, and Lystra, whence Timothy himself was. <q>What <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> I endured.</q> There was twofold matter of consolation, that I displayed a generous <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and that I was not forsaken. It cannot be said, that God abandoned me, but He rendered my crown more radiant.</p>

<p><q>What <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</q></p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse12">Ver. 12</a>. <q>Yea, and all those that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.</q></p>

<p>But why, he says, should I speak only of myself? Each one that will live godly will be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Here he calls afflictions and sorrows, <q><a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>,</q> for it is not possible that a man pursuing the course of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should not be exposed to grief, tribulation, and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. For how can he escape it who is treading in the strait and narrow way, and who has heard, that <q>in the world you shall have tribulation</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John 16:33</a></span> If Job in his time said, <q>The life of man upon earth is a state of trial</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job007.htm#verse1">Job 7:1</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span>; how much more was it so in those days?</p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse13">Ver. 13</a>. <q>But <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</q></p>

<p>Let none of these things, he says, disturb you, if they are in prosperity, and thou in trials. Such is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case. From my own instance you may learn that it is impossible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in his warfare with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, not to be exposed to tribulation. One cannot be in combat and live luxuriously, one cannot be wrestling and feasting. Let none therefore of those who are contending seek for ease or joyous living. Again, the present state is contest, warfare, tribulation, straits, and trials, and the very scene of conflicts. The season for rest is not now, this is the time for toil and labor. No one who has just stripped and anointed himself thinks of ease. If you think of ease, why did you strip, or prepare to fight? <q>But do I not maintain the fight?</q> you say. What, when you do not conquer your desires, nor resist the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> bias of nature?</p>

<p><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse14">Ver. 14</a>. <q>But continue thou in the things that you have learned and hast been assured of, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> of whom you have learned them; And that from a child you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, which are able to make you wise unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q></p>

<p>What is this? As the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David exhorted, saying, <q>Be not thou <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> against the workers of iniquity</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa036.htm#verse1">Psalm 37:1</a></span>, so <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> exhorts, <q>Continue thou in the things which you have learned,</q> and not simply learned, but <q>hast been assured of,</q> that is, hast <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. And what have I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? That this is the Life. And if you see things happening contrary to your belief, be not troubled. The same happened  to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, yet he was not affected at it. He had heard, <q>In Isaac shall your seed be called</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gen021.htm#verse12">Genesis 21:12</a></span>; and he was commanded to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> Isaac, yet he was not troubled nor dismayed. Let no one be offended because of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. This the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> taught from the beginning.</p>

<p>What then, if the good be in prosperity, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> be punished? The one is likely to happen, the other not so. For the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> will possibly be punished, but the good cannot always be rejoicing. No one was equal to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, yet he passed all his life in afflictions, in tears and groanings night and day. <q>For the space of three years,</q> he says, <q>I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse31">Acts 20:31</a></span> And again: <q>That which comes upon me daily.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse28">1 Corinthians 11:28</a></span> He did not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> today, and grieve tomorrow, but he ceased not daily to grieve. How then does he say, <q>Evil men shall wax worse and worse</q>? He has not said, they shall find rest, but <q>they shall wax worse and worse.</q> Their progress is for the worse. He has not said, they shall be in prosperity. But if they are punished, they are punished that you may not suppose their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are unavenged. For since we are not deterred from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, in very tenderness He rouses us from our insensibility, and awakens us. If no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man was ever punished, no one would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God presides over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs. If all were punished, no one would expect a future resurrection, since all had received their due here. On this account He both punishes, and forbears to punish. On this account the righteous suffer tribulation here, because they are sojourners, and strangers, and are in a foreign country. The just therefore endure these things for the purpose of trial. For hear what God said to Job: <q>Do you think that I have warned you otherwise, than that you might appear just?</q>  <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/job040.htm#verse3">Job 40:3</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> But sinners when they endure any affliction suffer but the punishment of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Under all circumstances, therefore, whether afflictive or otherwise, let us give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For both are beneficial. He does nothing in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> or enmity to us, but all things from care and consideration for us.</p>

<p><q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that from a child you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the sacred writings.</q> The <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> he calls <q>sacred writings.</q> In these you were nurtured, so that through them your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought to be firm and unshaken. For the root was laid deep, and nourished by length of time,  nor will anything subvert it.</p>

<p>And speaking of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, he has added, <q>Which are able to make you wise,</q> that is, they will not suffer you to have any foolish feeling, such as most men have. For he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> as he ought, is not offended at anything that happens; he endures all things manfully, referring them partly to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to the incomprehensible nature of the divine dispensation, and partly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> reasons for them, and finding examples in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. Since it is a great sign of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> not to be curious about everything, nor to wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things. And if you will allow me, I will explain myself by an example. Let us suppose a river, or rather rivers (I ask no allowance, I only speak of what rivers really are,) all are not of the same depth. Some have a shallow bed, others one deep enough to drown one unacquainted with it. In one part there are whirlpools, and not in another. It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> therefore to forbear to make trial of all,  and it is no small <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> not to wish to sound all the depths: whereas he that would venture on every part of the river, is really most <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the peculiar nature of rivers, and will often be in danger of perishing, from venturing into the deeper parts with the same boldness with which he crossed the shallows. So it is in the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He that will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all things, and ventures to intrude into everything, he it is that is most <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> what God is. And of rivers indeed, the greater part is safe, and the depths and whirlpools few, but with respect to the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the greater part is hidden, and it is not possible to trace out His works. Why then are you bent on drowning yourself in those depths?</p>

<p>Know this, however, that God dispenses all things, that He provides for all, that we are free agents, that some things He works, and some things He permits; that He wills nothing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be done; that all things are not done by His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but some by ours also; all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things by ours alone, all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things by our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> conjointly with His influence; and that nothing is without His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Therefore He works all things.  Thou then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this canst reckon what things are good, what are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and what are indifferent. Thus <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but riches and poverty, life and death, are things indifferent. If you know this, you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> thereby, that the righteous are afflicted that they may be crowned, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that they may receive the punishment of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But all sinners are not punished here, lest the generality should disbelieve the Resurrection; nor all the righteous afflicted, lest men should think that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, is approved. These are the rules and limits. Bring what you will to the test of these, and you will not be perplexed with <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. For as there is among calculators the number of six thousand, to which all things can be reduced, and everything can be divided and multiplied in the scale of six thousand, and this is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all who are acquainted with arithmetic;  so he who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> those rules, which I will briefly recapitulate, will never be offended. And what are these? That <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a good, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; that diseases, poverty, ill-treatment, false accusations, and the like, are things indifferent; that the righteous are afflicted here, or if ever they are in prosperity, it is that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may not appear odious; that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> enjoy pleasure now that hereafter they may be punished, or if they are sometimes visited, it is that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> may not seem to be approved, nor their actions to go unpunished; that all are not punished, lest there should be a disbelief of the time of resurrection; that even of the good, some who have done bad actions are quit of them here; and of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, some have good ones, and are rewarded for them here, that their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> may be punished hereafter <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse5">Matthew 6:5</a></span>; that the works of God are for the most part incomprehensible, and that the difference between us and Him is greater than can be expressed. If we reason on these grounds, nothing will be able to trouble or perplex us. If we listen to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> continually, we shall find many such examples.</p>

<p><q>Which are able,</q> he says, <q>to make you wise unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q></p>

<p>For the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> suggest to us what is to be done, and what is not to be done. For hear this blessed one elsewhere saying, <q>You are confident that you yourself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse19">Romans 2:19-20</a></span> You see that the Law is the light of them which are in darkness; and if that which shows the letter, the letter which kills, is light, what then is the Spirit which quickens? If the Old Covenant is light, what is the New, which contains so many, and so great revelations? Where the difference is as great, as if any one should open heaven to those who only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the earth, and make all things there visible. There we learn concerning <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, heaven, and judgment. Let us not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in things irrational. They are nothing but imposture. <q>What,</q> you say, <q>when what they foretell comes to pass?</q> It is because you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it, if it does come to pass. The <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">impostor</a> has taken you captive. Your life is in his power, he manages you as he will. If a captain of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> should have under his power and disposal the son of a king, who had fled to him, preferring the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, and his lawless company, would he be able to pronounce whether he would live or die? Assuredly he would, not because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the future, but because he is the disposer of his life or death, the youth having put himself in his power. For according to his own pleasure, he may either kill him, or spare his life, as he has become subject to him, and it is equally at his  disposal to say whether you shall be rich or poor. The greater part of the world have delivered themselves up into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>And furthermore, it contributes much to favor the pretenses of these deceivers, that a man has accustomed himself to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in them. For no one takes notice of their failures, but their lucky conjectures are observed. But if these men have any power of prognosticating, bring them to me, a believer. I say not this, as magnifying myself, (for it is no great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to be superior to these things,) and indeed I am deep-laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but with respect to these matters, I will not be humble-minded; by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God I despise them all. Bring me this pretender to magic; let him, if he has any power of prognosticating, tell me what will happen to me tomorrow. But he will not tell me. For I am under the power of the King, and he has no claim to my allegiance or submission. I am far from his holes and caverns. I <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> under the king. <q>But some one committed theft,</q> you say, <q>and this man discovered it.</q> This is not always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, certainly, but for the most part absurdities and falsehoods. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing. If indeed they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything, they ought rather to speak of their own concerns, how the numerous offerings to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> have been stolen, how so much of their gold has been melted. Why have they not informed their Priests? Even for the sake of money, they have not been able to give information when their idol-temples have been burnt, and many have perished with them.  Why do they not provide for their own safety? But it is altogether a matter of chance, if they have predicted anything. With us there are <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and they do not fail. They do not speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in one instance and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in another, but always declare the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for this is the privilege of foreknowledge.</p>

<p>Cease, then, from this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, I beseech you, if at least you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ; and if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> not, why do you expose yourselves? Why do you deceive? <q>How long will you halt on both your hips?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse21">1 Kings 18:21</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> Why do you go to them? Why enquire of them? The instant you go to them, the instant you enquire, you put yourself in slavery to them. For you enquire, as if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. <q>No,</q> you say, <q>I do not enquire, as believing, but making trial of them.</q> But to make trial, whether they speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, is the part not of one who believes that they are false, but of one who still doubts. Wherefore then do you enquire what will happen? For if they answered, <q>This will happen, but do so and so, and you will escape it</q>; even in that case you ought by no means to be an idolater; yet your <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> were not so great. But if they foretell future events,  he that listens to them will gain nothing more than unavailing sorrow. The event does not happen, but he suffers the uneasiness, and torments,  himself.</p>

<p>If it were for our good, God would not have grudged us this foreknowledge. He who has revealed to us things in heaven, would not have envied us. For, <q>All things,</q> He says, <q>that I have heard of the Father I have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you</q>; and, <q>I call you not servants, but friends. You are my friends.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John 15:15</a></span> Why then did He not make these things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto us? Because He would not have us concerned about them. And as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that He does not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> us this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, such things were revealed to the ancients, because they were babes, even about an ass,  and the like. But to us, because He would not have us concerned about such things, He has not cared to reveal them. But what do we learn? Things which they never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, for little indeed were all those things of old. But what we are taught is this, that we shall rise again, that we shall be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and incorruptible, that our life shall have no end, that all things will pass away, that we shall be caught up in the clouds, that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall suffer punishment, and numberless other things, and in all these there is no <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. Is it not better to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these than to hear that the ass that was lost is found? Lo, you have gotten your ass! Lo, you have found him! What is your gain? Will he not soon be lost again some other way? For if he leave you not, at least you will lose him in your death. But the things which I have mentioned, if we will but hold them fast, we shall retain perpetually. These therefore let us pursue. To these stable and enduring goods let us attach ourselves. Let us not give heed to soothsayers, fortune-tellers, and jugglers, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things certainly, whose <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is universal. Thus we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all that it befits us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and shall obtain all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness, etc.</p>
