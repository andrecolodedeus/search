<h1>Homily 8 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 1:9</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.</q></div>

<p>1. Nothing hinders us from handling today also the same words, since before we were prevented by the setting forth of doctrines, from considering all that was read. Where now are those who deny that He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? For here He is called <q>the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John 14:6</a></span>, and elsewhere very <q>Truth</q> and very <q>Life.</q> That saying we will discuss more clearly when we come to the place; but at present we must for a while be speaking to your Charity of that other matter.</p>

<p>If He <q>lights every man that comes into the world,</q> how is it that so many continue unenlightened? For not all have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the majesty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. How then does He <q>light every man</q>? He lights all as far as in Him lies. But if some, wilfully closing the eyes of their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, would not receive the rays of that Light, their darkness arises not from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Light, but from their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, who willfully deprive themselves of the gift. For the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is shed forth upon all, turning itself back neither from Jew, nor Greek, nor Barbarian, nor Scythian, nor free, nor bond, nor male, nor female, nor old, nor young, but admitting all alike, and inviting with an equal regard. And those who are not willing to enjoy this gift, ought in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to impute their blindness to themselves; for if when the gate is opened to all, and there is none to hinder, any being willfully <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>  remain without, they perish through none other, but only through their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<h2>John 1:10</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>He was in the world.</q></div>

<p>But not as of equal duration with the world. Away with the thought. Wherefore he adds, <q>And the world was made by Him</q>; thus leading you up again to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>  <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the Only-Begotten. For he who has heard that this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is His work, though he be very dull, though he be a hater, though he be an enemy of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will certainly, willing or unwilling, be forced to confess that the maker is before his works. Whence wonder always comes over me at the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>, who dared to look in the face so manifest a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and voluntarily threw himself down the precipice.   For he erred not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> but with full <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, being in the same case as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For as they, looking to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, gave up sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he was the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but not confessing Him, because of their rulers, lest they should be cast out of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>; so it is said that he, to gratify a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,  sold his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. A powerful thing, powerful indeed, is the tyranny of vainglory; it is able to make blind the eyes even of the wise, except they be sober; for if the taking of gifts can effect this, much more will the yet more violent feeling of this passion. Wherefore Jesus said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>How can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, which receive <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> one of another, and seek not the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that comes from God only?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse44">John 5:44</a></span></p>

<p><q>And the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not.</q> By <q>the world</q> he here means the multitude, which is corrupt, and closely attached  to earthly things, the common  turbulent, silly people. For the friends and favorites  of God all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, even before His coming in the flesh. Concerning the Patriarch Christ Himself speaks by name, <q>that your father <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John 8:56</a></span> And concerning David, confuting the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> He said, <q>How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, the Lord said unto my Lord, Sit on My right hand.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse43">Matthew 22:43</a>; <a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse36">Mark 12:36</a>; <a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse42">Luke 20:42</a></span> And in many places, disputing with them, He mentions <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; and the Apostle (mentions) the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; for Peter declares, that all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> from Samuel <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, and proclaimed beforehand His coming afar off, when he says, <q>All the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse24">Acts 3:24</a></span> But Jacob and his father, as well as his grandfather, He both appeared to and talked with, and promised that He would give them many and great blessings, which also He brought to pass.</p>

<p><q>How then,</q> says one, <q>did He say Himself, 'Many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have desired to see those things which you see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which you hear, and have not heard them'? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse24">Luke 10:24</a></span> Did they then not share in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him?</q> Surely they did; and I will endeavor to make this plain from this very saying, by which some think that they are deprived of it. <q>For many,</q> He says, <q>have desired to see the things which you see.</q> So that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He would come [to men] from heaven, and would live and teach  as He lived and taught; for had they not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, they could have not desired, since no one can conceive desire for things of which he has no idea; therefore they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and that He would come among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. What then are the things which they did not hear? What those which they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? The things which you now see and hear. For if they did hear His voice and did see Him, it was not in the Flesh, not among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; nor when He was living so familiarly, and conversing so frankly with them.  And indeed He to show this said not simply, <q>to see</q> <q>Me</q>: but what? <q>the things which you see</q>; nor <q>to hear</q> <q>Me</q>: but what? <q>the things which you hear.</q>  So that if they did not behold His coming in the Flesh, still they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it would be, and they desired it, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him without having seen Him in the Flesh.</p>

<p>When therefore the Greeks bring charges such as these against us, and say; <q>What then did Christ in former time, that He did not look upon the race of men? And for what possible reason did He come at last to assist in our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, after neglecting us so long?</q> we will reply, that before this He was in the world, and took thought for His works, and was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all who were worthy. But if you should say, that, because all did not then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, because He was only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by those noble and excellent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, therefore He was not acknowledged; at this rate you will not allow that He is worshipped even now, since even now all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him. But as at present no one, because of those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him, would refuse credit to those who do, so as regards former times, we must not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that He was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to many, or rather to all of those noble and admirable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<p>2. And if any one say, <q>Why did not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> give heed to Him? Nor all worship Him, but the just only?</q> I also will ask, why even now do not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him? But why do I speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when not all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> His Father then, or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him now? For some say, that all things are borne along by chance, while others commit the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> to devils. Others invent another God besides Him, and some blasphemously assert, that His is an opposing power,  and think that His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> are the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> d&aelig;mon. What then? Shall we say that He is not God because there  are some who say so? And shall we confess Him to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? For there are some who even so <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him. Away with such mental wandering, such utter insanity. If we should delineate  doctrines according to the judgment of madmen, there is nothing to hinder us from being mad ourselves with most grievous <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. No one will assert, looking to those who have weak vision, that the sun is injurious to the eyes, but he will say that it is fitted to give light, drawing his judgments from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in health. And no one will call honey bitter, because it seems so to the sense of the sick. And will any, from the imaginations of men diseased (in mind) decide that God either is not, or is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; or that He sometimes indeed exerts His Providence, sometimes does not so at all? Who can say that such men are of sound <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or deny that they are beside themselves, delirious, utterly mad?</p>

<p><q>The world,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not</q>; but they of whom the world was not worthy <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him. And having spoken of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not, he in a short time puts the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; for he does not absolutely say, that no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, but that <q>the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him not</q>; that is, those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are as it were nailed to the world alone, and who mind the things of the world. For so Christ was wont to call them; as when He says, <q>O Holy  Father, the world has not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> You.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse25">Luke 17:25</a></span> The world then was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, not only of Him, but also of His Father, as we have said; for nothing so darkens  the mind as to be closely attached  to present things.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> therefore this, remove yourselves from the world, and tear yourselves as much as possible from carnal things, for the loss which comes to you from these lies not in common matters, but in what is the chief of goods. For it is not possible for the man who clings strongly to the things of the present life really  to lay hold on those in heaven, but he who is earnest about the one must needs lose the other. <q>You cannot,</q> He says, <q>serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">Mammon</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew 6:24</a></span>, for you must hold to the one and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the other. And this too the very experience of the things proclaims aloud. Those, for instance, who deride the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of money, are especially the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God as they ought, just as those who respect that sovereignty (of Mammon), are the men who above all others have the slackest  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Him. For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when made captive once for all  by <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, will not easily or readily refuse doing or saying any of the things which <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as being the slave of another master, and one who gives all his commands in direct opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Return then at length to your sober senses, and rouse yourselves, and calling to mind whose servants we are, let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> His kingdom only; let us weep, let us wail for the times past in which we were servants of Mammon; let us cast off once for all his yoke so intolerable, so heavy, and continue to bear the light and easy yoke of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For He lays no such commands upon us as Mammon does. Mammon bids us be enemies to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but Christ, on the contrary, to embrace and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> all. The one having nailed us  to the clay and the brickmaking, (for gold is this,) allows us not even at night to take breath a little; the other releases us from this excessive and insensate care, and bids us gather treasures in heaven, not by <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> towards others, but by our own righteousness. The one after our many toils and sufferings is not able to assist us when we are punished in that place  and suffer because of his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, nay, he increases the flame; the other, though He command us to give but a cup of cold water, never allows us to lose our reward and recompense even for this, but repays us with great abundance. How then is it not extremest folly to slight a rule so mild, so full of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and to serve a thankless, ungrateful tyrant, and one who neither in this world nor in the world to come is able to help those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> and give heed to him. Nor is this the only dreadful thing, nor is this only the penalty, that he does not defend them when they are being punished; but that besides this, he, as I before said, surrounds those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> him with ten thousand <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For of those who are punished in that place, one may see that the greater part are punished for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, that they were slaves to money, that they loved gold, and would not assist those who needed. That we be not in this case, let us scatter, let us give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, let us deliver our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from hurtful cares in this world, and from the vengeance, which because of these things is appointed for us in that place. Let us store up righteousness in the heavens. Instead of riches upon earth, let us collect treasures impregnable, treasures which can accompany us on our journey to heaven, which can assist us in our peril, and make the Judge propitious at that hour. Whom may we all have gracious unto us, both now and at that day, and enjoy with much confidence  the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things prepared in the heavens for those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him as they ought, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom, to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, now and ever, and world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
