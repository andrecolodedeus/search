<h1>Homily 8 on the Statues</h1>

<p><strong>An exhortation to virtue&mdash; and particularly upon the passage, <q>God was walking in Paradise in the cool of the day:</q>&mdash; and again on the subject of abstaining from oaths.</strong></p>

<p>You have lately heard, how all Scripture brings consolation and comfort, although it be an historical narrative. For instance, <q>In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191366"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> was an historical declaration; but it was shown in our discourse, that this sentence was one pregnant with comfort; as, for example, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made us a twofold table,  by spreading out the sea and the land at the same time; by kindling above the twofold lights, the sun and moon; by determining the twofold seasons of their course, the day and night, the one for labour, and the other for rest. For the night ministers to us no less benefit than the day. But as I said with reference to trees, those which are barren, rival in their utility those which bear fruit; since we are thus not necessitated to touch those trees which are pleasant for food, for the purposes of building. The wild and untamed animals are also subservient to our need, in no less a degree than the tame animals; by driving us together, through the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of them, into cities; making us more cautious, and binding us to one another; and by exercising the strength of some, and freeing others from their sicknesses; for the physicians concoct many medicines out of these;  and by reminding us of our ancient <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For when I hear it said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of you, and the dread of you, shall be upon all the wild beasts of the earth:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191369"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;9:2</a></span> and then observe, that this <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was afterwards curtailed, I am reminded of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which has dissipated the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of us, and undermined our authority. Thus I become a better and a wiser  man, while I learn the harm that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has occasioned us. As then, what I said was, that the things alluded to, and others of a similar kind, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is the Maker, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of, contribute not a little to our present life; so now also I say, that the night no less than the day brings along with it its advantage, being a rest from labours, and a medicine for disease. Often, indeed, physicians, though exerting themselves in many ways, and preparing an endless variety of remedies, are not able to deliver the man who is labouring under infirmity. But sleep coming upon him of its own accord has entirely removed the disease, and freed them  from an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> deal of trouble. Night, again, is not only a medicine for bodily labours, but also for mental diseases, in giving rest to anguished <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Ofttimes it happens that some one has lost a son;  and comforters without number have been of no avail to withdraw him from tears and groans. But on the approach of night, conquered by the despotic power  of sleep, he has closed his eyelids in slumber, and received some small relief from the miseries of the day time.</p>

<p>2. And now, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, let us proceed to the subject which has given rise to these observations. For well I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that you are all eagerly awaiting this matter; and that each one of you is in pain till he learn on what account this Book was not given from the beginning. But even now I do not see that the time is fit for a discourse on this subject. And why so? Because the week has nearly arrived at its close with us, and I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to touch upon a subject, the exposition of which I should presently afterwards be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to cut short. For the subject requires of us several days in succession, and a continuous effort of memory: wherefore we must again defer it.  But take it not amiss! We will assuredly pay you the debt with interest; for thus it is expedient both for you, and for us who are to discharge it. Meanwhile, however, let us now speak on that subject which we left out yesterday. And what was it we left out yesterday? <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was walking,</q> it says, <q>in Paradise in the cool of the day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191375"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;3:8</a></span> What is here meant, I ask? <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was walking!</q> God was not walking; for how should He do this who is everywhere present and fills all things? But He caused a perception of this sort in Adam, in order that he might collect  himself; that he might not be careless; that in flying and in hiding himself, he might present beforehand some portion of the excuse, even before any words had passed. For even as those who are about to be led to the tribunal, to sustain the charges respecting the crimes they have committed, present themselves before those who are to try them with a squalid, begrimed, sad, and subdued visage, in order that from their appearance, they may incline them to loving-kindness, mercy, and forgiveness, so also did it happen in the case of Adam. For it was necessary that he should be led to this Tribunal in a subdued state. Therefore God took him beforehand, and humbled him. But that some one was walking there, he perceived; but whence came he to suppose that God was walking there? Such is the habitual custom of those who have committed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. They are suspicious of all things; they tremble at shadows; they are in terror at every sound, and they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that every one is approaching them in a hostile manner. Often therefore the guilty, when they observe people running on another business, suppose that they have come against them; and when others are conversing one with another on quite a different subject, they that are conscious of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> suppose they are conversing about them.</p>

<p>3. For such is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that it betrays while no one finds fault; it condemns while no one accuses; it makes the sinner a timid being; one that trembles at a sound; even as righteousness has the contrary effect. Hear, at least, how the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> describes this cowardice of the former, and this boldness of the latter. <q>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> flee when no man pursues.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191377"><a href="../bible/pro028.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;28:1</a></span> How does he flee when no man pursues? He has that within which drives him on&mdash; an accuser in his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; and this he carries about everywhere; and just as it would be impossible to flee from himself, so neither can he escape the persecutor within; but wherever he goes,  he is scourged, and has an incurable wound! But not such is the righteous man. Of what nature then is he? Hear: <q>The righteous is bold as a lion!</q> Such a man was Elias. He saw, for instance, the king coming towards him, and when he said, <q>Why is it that you pervert <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</q>  he answered, <q>I pervert not <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, but you and your father's house.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note191380"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;18:17-18</a></span> Truly, the just man is bold as a lion; for he stood up against the king just as a lion does against some vile cur. Although the one had the purple, the other had the sheepskin, which was the more venerable garment of the two; for that purple brought forth the grievous famine; but this sheepskin effected a liberation from that calamity! It divided the Jordan! It made Elisha a two-fold  Elias! O how great is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the Saints! Not only their words; not only their bodies, but even their very garments are always esteemed venerable by the whole creation. The sheepskin of this man divided the Jordan! The sandals of the Three Children trampled down the fire! The word of Elisha changed the waters, so that it made them to bear the iron on their surface! The rod of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> divided the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> and cleft  the rock! The garments of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> expelled diseases! The shadow of Peter put death to flight! The ashes of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Martyrs  drive away <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>! For this reason they do all things with authority, even as Elias did. For he looked not on the diadem, nor the outward pomp  of the king, but he looked on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> clad in rags, squalid, begrimed, and in a more wretched condition than that of any criminal; and seeing him the captive and slave of his <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, he despised his power. For he seemed to see a king but in a scene, and not a real one. For what was the advantage of outward abundance, when the poverty within was so great? And what harm could outward poverty do, when there was such a treasure of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> within? Such a lion also was the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>; for when he had entered into the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and only raised his voice, he shook all the foundations; he gnawed in pieces  the fetters, employing not his teeth, but words; on which account it were fitting to call such men not merely lions, but something more than lions; for a lion ofttimes, after he has fallen into a net, is taken; but the Saints when they are bound, become still more powerful; just as this blessed man did then in the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, having loosed the prisoners, shaken the walls, and bound the keeper, and overcome him by the word of godliness. The lion utters his voice, and puts all the wild beasts to flight. The Saint utters his voice, and drives away the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> on every side! The weapons of the lion are a hairy mane, pointed claws, and sharp teeth. The weapons of the righteous man are spiritual wisdom, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, patience, contempt of all present things. Whoever has these weapons shall not only be able to deride <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, but even the adverse powers themselves.</p>

<p>4. Study then, O man, the life according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and no one shall conquer you at any time; and although you may be accounted the most insignificant of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, you shall be more powerful than all. On the other hand, if you are indifferent about <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, though thou were the most powerful of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, you will easily be worsted by all that assail you. And the examples already quoted <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> this. But if you are desirous, I will also endeavour to teach you by actual facts  the unconquerableness of the righteous, and the vulnerable condition of sinners. Hear then how the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> intimates both these particulars. <q>The ungodly,</q> says he, <q>are not so, but are like the chaff which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth.</q>  For even as chaff lies exposed to the gusts of wind, and is easily caught up and swept along, so is also the sinner driven about by every <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>; for while he is at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with himself, and bears the warfare about with him, what hope of safety does he possess; betrayed as he is at home, and carrying with him that <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which is a constant enemy? Such, however, is not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the righteous man. But what manner of man is he? Hear the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying, <q>They that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion.</q>  What means then, <q>As Mount Zion?</q> <q>He shall not be shaken,</q> says he, <q>for ever.</q> For whatever engines you bring up, whatever darts you hurl, desiring to overturn a mountain, you will never be able to prevail; for how can you? You will break in pieces all your engines, and exhaust your own strength. Such also is the righteous man. Whatever blows he may receive, he suffers no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> therefrom; but destroys the power of those who take counsel against him, and not of men only, but of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. You have heard often what engines the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> brought up against Job; but not only did he fail to overthrow that mountain, but drew back exhausted, his darts broken to pieces, and his engines rendered useless, by that assault!</p>

<p>5. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> these things, let us take heed to our life; and let us not be earnest as to the goods that perish; neither as to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that goes out; nor as to that body which grows old; nor as to that beauty which is fading; nor as to that pleasure which is fleeting; but let us expend all our care about the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and let us provide for the welfare of this in every way. For to cure the body, when diseased, is not an easy matter to every one; but to cure a sick <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is easy to all; and the sickness of the body requires medicines, as well as money, for its healing; but the healing of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is a thing that is easy to procure, and devoid of expense. And the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the flesh is with much labour delivered from those wounds which are troublesome; for very often the knife must be applied, and medicines that are bitter; but with respect to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> there is nothing of this kind. It suffices only to exercise the will, and the desire, and all things are accomplished. And this has been the work of God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>. For inasmuch as from bodily sickness no great injury could arise, (for though we were not diseased, yet death would in any case come, and destroy and dissolve the body); but everything depends upon the health of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; this being by far the more precious and necessary, He has made the medicining of it easy, and void of expense or pain. What excuse therefore, or what pardon shall we obtain, if when the body is sick, and money must be expended on its behalf, and physicians called in, and much anguish endured, we make this so much a matter of our care (though what might result from that sickness could be no great injury to us), and yet treat the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with neglect? And this, when we are neither called upon to pay down money; nor to give others any trouble; nor to sustain any sufferings; but without any of all these things, by only choosing and willing, have it in our power to accomplish the entire amendment of it; and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> assuredly that if we fail to do this, we shall sustain the extreme sentence, and punishments, and penalties, which are inexorable! For tell me, if any one promised to teach you the healing art in a short space of time, without money or labour, would you not think him a benefactor? Would you not submit both to do and to suffer all things, whatsoever he who promised these things commanded? Behold, now, it is permitted you without labour to find a medicine for wounds, not of the body, but of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and to restore it to a state of health, without any suffering! Let us not be indifferent to the matter! For <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> what is the pain of laying aside <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against one who has aggrieved you? It is a pain, indeed, to remember injuries, and not to be reconciled! What labour is it to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and to ask for a thousand <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is ready to give? What labour is it, not to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of any one? What difficulty is there in being delivered from <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and ill-will? What trouble is it to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one's neighbour? What suffering is it not to utter shameful words, nor to revile, nor to insult another? What fatigue is it not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>? For again I return to this same admonition. The labour of swearing is indeed exceedingly great. Oftentimes, while under the influence of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, we have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, perhaps, that we would never be reconciled to those who have injured us. Yet afterwards, when our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> was quenched, and our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> allayed, desiring to be reconciled, and restrained by the obligation of these oaths, we have suffered the same anguish, as if we were in a snare, and held fast by indissoluble bonds. Of which fact the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> being aware, and understanding clearly that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is a fire; that it is easily extinguished, and that when it is extinguished, then reconciliation and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> follows; wishing this fire to remain unquenched, he often binds us by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>; so that although the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> should cease, the obligation of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> remaining may keep up the fire within us; and that one of these two things may take place, either that being reconciled we are forsworn, or that not being reconciled we subject ourselves to the penalties of cherishing <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.</p>

<p>6. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> these things then, let us avoid oaths; and let our mouth continually practise the saying, <q>Believe me;</q>  and this will be to us a foundation for all <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> behaviour;  for the tongue, when it has been disciplined to use this one expression, is ashamed, and would blush to utter words that are disgraceful and ugly; and should it at any time be drawn away by habit, it will be checked again, by having many accusers. For when any one observes him who is not a swearer giving utterance to foul words, he will take his advantage over him, and ridicule, and exclaim tauntingly, <q>You who sayest in all affairs, 'Believe me,' and venturest not to utter an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, do you disgrace your tongue with these shameful expressions?</q> So that being forcibly urged by those who are with us, even if unwilling, we shall return again to a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> behaviour. <q>But what,</q> says one, <q>if it be necessary to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>?</q> Where there is a transgression of the law, there is no such thing as necessity. <q>Is it possible then,</q> it is replied, <q>not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> at all?</q> What do you say? Hath God commanded, and do you dare to ask if it be possible for His law to be kept? Why, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> it is a thing impossible that His law should not be kept; and I am desirous to persuade you from present circumstances of this; that so far from its being impossible not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, it is impossible to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>.  For behold, the inhabitants of the city were commanded to bring in a payment of gold,  such as it might have seemed beyond the power of many to do; yet the greater part of the sum has been collected; and you may hear the tax gatherers saying, <q>Why delay, man? Why put us off from day to day? It is not possible to avoid it. It is the law of the Emperor, which admits of no delay.</q> What do you say, I ask? The Emperor has commanded you to bring in your money, and it is impossible not to bring it in! God has commanded you to avoid oaths! And how do you say, it is impossible to avoid them!</p>

<p>7. I am now for the sixth day admonishing you in respect of this precept. Henceforth, I am desirous to take leave  of you, meaning to abstain from the subject, that you may be on your guard. There will no longer be any excuse or allowance for you; for of right, indeed, if nothing had been said on this matter, it ought to have been amended of yourselves, for it is not a thing of an intricate nature, or that requires great preparation. But since you have enjoyed the advantage of so much admonition and counsel, what excuse will you have to offer, when you stand accused before that dread tribunal, and are required to give account of this transgression. It is impossible to invent any excuse; but of necessity you must either go hence amended, or, if you have not amended, be punished, and abide the extremest penalty! Thinking, therefore, upon all these things, and departing hence with much anxiety about them, exhort ye one another, that the things spoken of during so many days may be kept with all watchfulness in your minds, so that while we are silent, you instructing, edifying, exhorting one another, may exhibit great improvement; and having fulfilled all the other precepts, may enjoy <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> crowns; which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> grant we may all obtain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom and with whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
