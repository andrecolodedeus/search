<h1>Homily 9 on Philippians</h1>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>--><span class="c1"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse19">Philippians 2:19-21</a></span> </p>

<p><q>But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your state. For I have no man likeminded, who will care <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> for your state. For they all seek their own, not the things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q></p>

<p>He had said, <q>have fallen out unto the progress of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole pr&aelig;torian guard.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse12">Philippians 1:12-13</a></span> Again, <q>Yea, and if I am offered upon the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and service of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse17">Philippians 2:17</a></span> By these words he strengthened them. Perchance they might suspect that his former words were spoken just to comfort them. What then? <q>I send Timothy unto you,</q> says he; for they desired to hear all things that concerned him. And wherefore said he not, <q>that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my state,</q> but, <q>that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yours</q>? Because Epaphroditus would have reported his state before the arrival of Timothy. Wherefore further on he says, But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse25">Philippians 2:25</a></span>; but I wish to learn of your affairs. For it is likely that he had remained long time with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> through his bodily weakness. So that he says, I wish to <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your state.</q> See then how he refers everything to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even the mission of Timothy, saying, <q>I hope in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>,</q> that is, I am confident that God will facilitate this for me, that I too may be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, when I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your state. As I refreshed you when you heard the very things of me which you had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> had advanced, that its enemies were put to shame, that the means by which they thought to injure, rather made me <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>; thus too do I wish to learn of your affairs, that I too may be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> when I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your state. Here he shows that they ought to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> for his bonds, and to be conformed to them, for they begot in him great pleasure; for the words, <q>that I too may be of good comfort,</q> imply, just as you are.</p>

<p>Oh, what longing had he toward Macedonia! He testifies the same to the Thessalonians, as when he says, <q>But we, brethren, being bereaved of  you for a short season,</q> etc. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse17">1 Thessalonians 2:17</a></span> And here he says, <q>I hope to send Timothy</q> that I may <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your state,</q> which is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of excessive care: for when he could not himself be with them, he sent his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as he could not endure to remain, even for a little time, in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of their state. For he did not learn all things by revelation of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and for this we can see some reason; for if the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that it were so, they would have lost all sense of shame,  but now from expectation of concealment, they were more easily corrected. In a high degree did he call their attention by saying, <q>that I too may be of good comfort,</q> and rendered them more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a>, so that, when Timothy came he might not find any other state of things, and report it to him. He seems to have acted in like sort in his own person, when he delayed his coming to the Corinthians, that they might repent; wherefore he wrote, <q>to spare you I forbare to come to <a href="../cathen/04363b.htm">Corinth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse23">2 Corinthians 1:23</a></span> For his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was manifested not simply in reporting his own state, but in his desire to learn of theirs; for this is the part of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has a care of others, which takes thought for them, which is always wrestling for them.</p>

<p>At the same time too, he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> them by sending Timothy. <q>What do you say? Do you send Timothy? And wherefore?</q> Because <q>I have no one likeminded</q>; that is, none of those whose care is like mine, none who <q>will care <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> for you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse20">Philippians 2:20</a></span> Had he then no one of those who were with him? No one likeminded, that is, who has yearnings and takes thought for you as I do. No one would lightly choose, he means, to make so long a journey for this purpose. Timothy is the one with me who loves you.  For I might have sent others, but there was none like him. This then is that likemindedness, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> as the master loves them. <q>Who,</q> says he, <q>will <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> care for you,</q> that is, as a father. <q>For they all seek their own, not the things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians 2:21</a></span>, their own comfort, their own safety. This too he writes to Timothy. But why does he lament such things as these? To teach us his hearers not to fall in like sort, to teach his hearers not to seek for remission from toil; for he who seeks remission from toil, seeks not the things that are Christ's, but his own. We ought to be prepared against every toil, against every distress.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse22">Ver. 22</a>. <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of him, that as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q></p>

<p>And that I speak not at random, <q>you yourselves,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> He presents then Timothy to them, and with reason, that he might enjoy much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from them. This too he does when he writes to the Corinthians, and he says, <q>Let no man therefore despise him, for he works the work of the Lord as I also do.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 16:10</a></span> This he said not as caring for him, but for those who receive him, that they might receive a great reward.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse23">Ver. 23</a>. <q>Him therefore,</q> he says, <q>I hope to send immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me,</q> that is, when I see where I stand, and what end my affairs will have.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse24">Ver. 24</a>. <q>But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come to you shortly.</q></p>

<p>I am not therefore sending him, as though I myself would not come, but that I may be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> when I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your state, that even in the mean time I may not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it. <q>But I trust in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,</q> says he. See how he makes all things depend on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and speaks nothing of his own mind. That is, God willing. </p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse25">Ver. 25</a>. <q>But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and fellow-worker, and fellow-soldier.</q></p>

<p>And him too he sends with the same praises as Timothy, for he commended him on these two points; first, in that he loved them, when he says, <q>who will care <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> for you</q>; and secondly, in that he had approved himself in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. And for the same reason, and in the same terms, he praises this man also: and how? By calling him a brother, and a fellow-worker, and not stopping at this point, but also <q>fellow-soldier,</q> he showed how he shared in his dangers, and testifies of him the same things which he testifies of himself. For <q>fellow-soldier</q> is more than <q>fellow-worker</q>; for perchance he gave aid in quiet matters, yet not so in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and dangers; but in saying <q>fellow-soldier,</q> he showed this too.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse25">Ver. 25</a>. <q>To send to you your messenger, and minister to my needs</q>; that is, I give you your own, since I send to you him that is your own, or, perhaps, that is your Teacher.  Again he adds many things concerning his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in saying,</p>

<p><!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Ver. 26, 27. <q>Since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because you had heard that he was sick. For indeed he was sick near unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</q></p>

<p>Here he aims at a farther point, making it manifest, that Epaphroditus too was well aware, how he was beloved of them. And this is no light thing toward loving. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how he was sick, he says; and he grieved that on his recovery he did not see you, and free you from the grief you had by reason of his sickness. Here too he gives another reason for sending so late to them, not from any remissness, but he kept Timothy because he had no one else, (for, as he had written, he had <q>no one likeminded,</q>) and Epaphroditus because of his sickness. He then shows that this was a long sickness, and had consumed much time, by adding, <q>for he was sick near unto death.</q> You see how anxious <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is to cut off from his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> all occasion of slighting or contempt, and every suspicion that his not coming was because he despised them. For nothing will have such power to draw a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> toward one, as the persuasion that his superior cares for him, and that he is full of heaviness on his account, for this is the part of exceeding <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Because <q>you have heard,</q> he says, <q>that he was sick; for he was sick near unto death.</q> And that I am not making an excuse, hear what follows. <q>But God had mercy on him.</q> What do you say, O <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>? Here it is written, that God's mercy retained and brought back again him who was on the point of departure. And yet if the world is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it is no mercy to leave a man in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Our answer to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is easy, but what shall we say to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>? For he perchance will question, and say, <q>if to depart and to be with Christ is far better,</q> how says he that he has obtained mercy? I would ask why the same Apostle says, that <q>it is more needful to abide with you</q>?  For as it was needful for him, so too for this man, who would hereafter depart to God with more exceeding riches, and greater boldness. Hereafter that would take place, even if it did not now, but the winning <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> is at an end for those who have once departed there. In many places too, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaks according to the common habits of his hearers, and not every where in accordance with his own heavenly wisdom: for he had to speak to men of the world who still feared death. Then he shows how he esteemed Epaphroditus, and thence he gets for him respect, by saying, that his preservation was so useful to himself, that the mercy which had been shown to Epaphroditus reached him also. Moreover, without this the present life is a good; were it not so, why does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> rank with punishment untimely deaths? As when he says, <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> many are weak and sickly among you, and not a few sleep</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse30">1 Corinthians 11:30</a></span>; for the future life is not (merely) better than an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> state, since (then) it were not good, but better than a good state.</p>

<p><q>Lest I should have,</q> he says, <q>sorrow upon sorrow</q>; sorrow from his death in addition to that which sprung from his sickness. By this he shows how much he prized Epaphroditus.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse28">Ver. 28</a>. <q>I have sent him therefore the more diligently.</q> What means <q>more diligently</q>? It is, without procrastination, without delay, with much speed, having bidden him lay all aside, and to go to you, that he might be freed from heaviness; for we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> not on hearing of the health of those we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, so much as when we see them, and chiefly so when this happens contrary to hope, as it was in the case of Epaphroditus.</p>

<p><q>I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that when you see him again, you may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</q> How <q>less sorrowful</q>? Because if you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, I too <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and he too joys at a pleasure of such sort, and I shall be <q>less sorrowful.</q> He said not sorrowless, but <q>less sorrowful,</q> to show that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> never was free from sorrow: for he who said, <q>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I burn not?</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2 Corinthians 11:29</a></span>, when could such an one be free from sorrow? That is, this despondency I now cast off.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse29">Ver. 29</a>. <q>Receive him therefore in the Lord with all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</q></p>

<p><q>In the Lord</q> either means spiritually and with much <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, or rather <q>in the Lord</q> means God willing. Receive him in a manner worthy of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> should be received with all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</p>

<p>All this he does for their sakes, not for that of his messengers, for greater gain has the doer than the receiver of a good deed. <q>And such hold in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>,</q> that is, receive him in a manner worthy of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse30">Ver. 30</a>. <q>Because for the work of Christ he came near unto death, hazarding his life, to supply that which was lacking in your service towards me.</q></p>

<p>This man had been publicly sent by the city of the Philippians, who had come as minister to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and perchance bringing him some contribution,  for toward the end of the Epistle he shows that he also brought him money, when he says, <q>Having received of Epaphroditus the things that came from you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse18">Philippians 4:18</a></span></p>

<p>It is probable then, that on his arrival at the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he found <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in great and urgent peril, so that those who were accustomed to resort to him were unable safely to do so, but were themselves in peril by their very attendance; which is wont to happen chiefly in very great dangers, and the exceeding <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of kings, (for when any one has offended the king, and is cast into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, and is strictly guarded, then even his servants are debarred from access, which probably then befell <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,) and that Epaphroditus, being of a noble nature, despised all danger, that he might go in unto him, and minister unto him, and do everything which need required. He therefore sets forth two facts, by which he gains for him their respect; the one, that he was in jeopardy well near unto death, he says, for my sake; the other, that in so suffering he was representing their city, so that the recompense for that his peril would be accounted to those who sent him, as if the city had sent him as their ambassador, so that a kind reception of him and approval of what he had done may rather be called a participation in the things that he had dared. And he said not, <q>for my sake,</q> but obtains the more credit for his words, by saying, <q>because for the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> since he acted not for my sake, but for God's sake <q>he was near unto death.</q> What then? Though by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God he died not, yet he himself regarded not his life, and gave himself up to any suffering that might befall him, so as not to remit his attendance on me. And if he gave himself up to death to attend on <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, much more would he have endured this for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel's</a> sake. Or rather, this also had been for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel's</a> sake, even to have died for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. For we may bind about our brows the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, not only by refusing to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, but such causes as these also make death <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and if I may say something startling, these latter do so far more than the former. For he who dares to face death for the lesser <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, will much rather for the greater. Let us therefore, when we see the Saints in danger, regard not our life, for it is impossible without daring ever to perform any noble act, but need is that he who takes thought beforehand for his safety here, should fall from that which is to come.</p>

<p><q>To supply,</q> he says, <q>your lack of service toward me.</q> What is this? The city was not present, but by sending him, it fulfilled through him all service toward me. He therefore supplied your lack of service, so that for this reason too he deserves to enjoy much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, since, what ye all should have done, this has he performed on your behalf. Here he shows that there is also a foregoing service rendered by those in safety to those in danger, for so he speaks of the lack,  and the lack of service. Do you see the spirit of the Apostle? These words spring not from arrogance, but from his great care towards them; for he calls the matter a <q>service</q> and a <q>lack,</q> that they may not be puffed up, but be moderate, nor think that they have rendered some great thing, but rather be humble-minded.</p>

<p>For we owe the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> a debt, and are not doing them a favor. For as supplies are due by those who are in peace and not engaged in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to such as stand in the army and fight (for these stand on their behoof), thus too is it here. For if <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had not taught, who would have cast him into <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>? Wherefore we ought to minister to the Saints. For is it not absurd to contribute to an earthly king, when engaged in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, all that he wants, as clothing and food, not according to his need alone, but abundantly, while to the King of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, when engaged in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and contending against far more bitter foes (for it is written, <q>our wrestling is not against flesh and blood</q>) <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians 6:12</a></span>, we will not supply urgent necessity? What folly is this! What ingratitude! What base <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of gain! But, as it seems, the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has greater force with us than <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and the future torments. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, all things are turned upside down; for political affairs are daily accomplished with much earnestness, and one must not be left behind, while of spiritual things there is no account taken at all; but the things which are demanded of us of necessity, and with compulsion, as though we were slaves, and against our wills, are laid down by us with much readiness, while such as are asked from willing minds, and as if from free men, are again deficient. I speak not against all, but against those who are behindhand with these supplies. For might not God have made these contributions compulsory? Yet He would not, for He has more care of you than of those whom you support. Wherefore He would not that you should contribute of necessity, since there is no recompense. And yet many of those who stand here are lower minded  than the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. Consider how great things the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> gave, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>,  <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a>, <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a> again, and again other <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithes</a>, and besides this thirteenths, and the shekel, and no one said, how much they devour; for the more they receive, the greater is the reward. They say not, They receive much, they are <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttons</a>; which words I hear now from some. They for their part, while they are building houses, and buying estates, still think they have nothing; but if any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is clothed in dress more bright than usual, and enjoys more than what is necessary for his sustenance, or has an attendant, that he may not be forced himself to act unbecomingly, they set the matter down for riches. And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we are rich even at this rate, and they admit it against their will; for we, though we have but little, are rich, while they, though they get everything about them, are poor.</p>

<p>How far shall our folly extend? Does it not suffice to our punishment that we do no good deed, but must we add to it the punishment of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> speaking? For if what he has were your gifts, you lose your reward by upbraiding him for what you gave. In a word, if you gave it, why do you upbraid him? You have already borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to his poverty, by saying that what he has are your gifts. Why then do you upbraid? You should not have given, did you intend so to do. But do you speak thus, when another gives? It is then more grievous, in that when you yourself hast not given, you upbraid for another man's good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. How great reward do you think those who are thus spoken of will receive? It is for God's sake they thus suffer. How and wherefore? Had they so willed, they might have taken up a trader's life, even though they received it not from their ancestors. For I hear many speaking thus at random, when we say that a certain man is poor. Had he willed, they say, he might have been rich, and then tauntingly add, His father, his grandfather, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not who was so; but now see what a robe he wears! But what? Tell me, ought he to go about naked? You then start nice questionings on these points, but see lest you thus speakest against yourself. Listen to that exhortation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which says, <q>Judge not that you be not judged.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse1">Matthew 7:1</a></span> He might, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, if he had willed, have led a trader's or a merchant's life, and would surely not have lacked. But he would not. What then, says one, is he here profited? Tell me, what is he profited? Does he wear silken robes? Does he proudly clear his way through the forum with a troop of followers? Is he borne along on horseback? Does he build houses, having where to dwell? If he act so, I too accuse him, and spare him not, but declare that he is unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. For how can he exhort others not to spend their time on these superfluities, who cannot advise himself? But if he has sufficient for support, is he therefore doing wrong? Would you have him lead a vagabond life, and beg? Would you, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, not also be put to shame? But if your father in the flesh did this, you would think shame of the thing. If your spiritual father be compelled so to do, will you not veil your head, and even think you are sinking into the earth? It is written, <q>A father's dishonor is a reproach to the children.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse11">Sirach 3:11</a></span> But what? Should he perish with famine? This were not like a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man; for God wills it not. But what do they straightway philosophize? It is written, say they, <q>Get you no gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, neither two coats, nor yet staves</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse9">Matthew 10:9-10</a></span>, while these men have three or four garments, and beds well spread. I am forced now to heave a bitter sigh, and, but that it had been indecorous, I had wept too! How so? Because we are such curious searchers into the motes of others, while we feel not the beams in our own eyes. Tell me, why do you not say this to yourself? The answer is, Because the command is laid only on our Teachers. When then <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>having food and covering we shall be therewith content</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 6:8</a></span>, says he this only to Teachers? By no means, but to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and this is clear, if we will begin farther back. For what does he say? <q>Godliness with contentment is great gain <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse6">1 Timothy 6:6</a></span>; for we brought nothing into this world, it is certain that neither can we carry anything out</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse7">1 Timothy 6:7</a></span>; he then straightway adds, <q>And having food and covering, we shall be therewith content; but they that desire to be rich, fall into a <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and a snare, and many foolish and hurtful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1 Timothy 6:8-9</a></span> You see that this is spoken to all; and how is it when he says again, <q>Make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans 13:14</a></span>, is not this said absolutely to all? And what when he says, <q>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats, but God shall bring to nought both it and them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse13">1 Corinthians 6:13</a></span>; or what when he says, <q>But she that gives herself to pleasure, is dead while she lives</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1 Timothy 5:6</a></span>, speaking of a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. Is then the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> a Teacher? Has not he said himself, <q>But I permit not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach, nor to have dominion over a man</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 2:12</a></span> But if a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, in old age, (and age has need of great attendance,) and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> nature too, (for the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> sex, being weak, has need of more refreshment,) if then, where there is both the age and the nature, he suffers her not to live in luxury, but even says that she is dead, (for he did not simply forbid a life of luxury, but said, <q>she who gives herself to luxury is dead while she lives,</q>) and thus has cut her off, (for she that is dead is cut off,) what indulgence then will any man have, who does those things, for which a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and an aged one too is punished?</p>

<p>Yet no one gives a thought to these things, no one searches them out. And this I have been compelled to say, not from any wish to free the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from these charges, but to spare you. They indeed suffer no harm at your hands, even if it is with <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that they are thus charged of being greedy of gain; for, whether you speak, or whether you forbear, they must there give an account to the Judge, so that your words hurt them not at all; but if your words are false besides, they for their part gain by these false accusations, while you hurt yourselves by these means. But it is not so with you; for be the things <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, which you bring against them, or be they false, you speak ill of them to your hurt. And how so? If they be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, in that you judge your Teachers, and subvert order, you do it to your hurt. For if we must not judge a brother, much less a Teacher. But if they be false, the punishment and retribution is intolerable; for of <q>every idle word you shall give account.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew 12:36</a></span> For your sake then I thus act and labor.</p>

<p>But as I said, no one searches out these things, no one busies himself about these things, no one communes with himself on any of these things. Would ye that I should add still more? <q>Whosoever forsakes not all that he has, says the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, is not worthy of Me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse33">Luke 14:33</a>; <a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse37">Matthew 10:37</a></span> What when he says, <q>It is hard for a rich man to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a></q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse23">Matthew 19:23</a>; <a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse24">Mark 10:24</a></span> What when he says again, <q>Woe unto you that are rich, for you have received your consolation</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse24">Luke 6:24</a></span> No one searches this out, no one bears it in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, no one reasons with himself, but all sit as severe inquisitors on other men's cases. Yet this is to make themselves sharers in the charges. But listen, that for your own sake I may free the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> from the charges, which you say lie against them, for the persuasion that they transgress the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inclines you not a little towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Come then, let us examine this matter. Christ said, <q>Provide neither gold nor silver, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor girdle, nor yet staves.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse9">Matthew 10:9-10</a></span> What then? Tell me, did Peter transgress this command? Surely he did so, in having a girdle and a garment, and shoes, for listen to the words of the Angel, <q>Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act012.htm#verse8">Acts 12:8</a></span> And yet he had no such great need of sandals, for at that season a man may go even unshod; their great use is in the winter, and yet he had them. What shall we say of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when he writes thus to Timothy, <q>Do your diligence to come before winter</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse21">2 Timothy 4:21</a></span> He gives him orders too and says, <q>The cloak that I left at <a href="../cathen/15063c.htm">Troas</a> with Carpus bring when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse13">2 Timothy 4:13</a></span> See he speaks of a cloak, and no one can say that he had not another which he wore; for if he did not wear one at all, it were superfluous to order this one to be brought, and if he could not be without one to wear, it is clear he had a second.</p>

<p>What shall we say of his remaining <q>two whole years in his own hired dwelling</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse30">Acts 28:30</a></span> Did then this chosen vessel disobey Christ? This man who said, <q>Yet I live; and yet no longer I, but Christ lives in me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians 2:20</a></span>, concerning whom Christ testified, saying, <q>He is a chosen vessel unto Me</q>? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts 9:15</a></span> I ought to leave this difficulty with you, without supplying any solution to the question. I ought to exact of you this penalty for your negligence in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, for this is the origin of all such difficulties. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, we are not trained in the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so we become sharp inquirers into the faults of others, while we take no account of our own. I ought then to have exacted from you this penalty. But what shall I do? Fathers freely give to their sons many things beyond what is fitting: when their fatherly compassion is kindled, on seeing their child with downcast look, and wasted with grief, they themselves also feel sharper pangs than he, and rest not until they have removed the ground of his dejection.</p>

<p>So be it at least here, be ye at least dejected at not receiving, that you may receive well. What then is it? They opposed not, far be it; but diligently followed the commands of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for those commands were but for a season, and not enduring; and this I say not from conjecture, but from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. And how? Luke relates that Christ said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and girdle, and shoes, did you lack anything? And they said nothing. But for the future provide them.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse35">Luke 22:35</a></span> But tell me, what could he do? Could he have but one coat? How then? If need was that this be washed, should he, because without it, stay at home? Should he without it go abroad in an unbecoming manner, when need called? Consider what a thing it would have been that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who made the circuit of the world with such great success, should remain at home for want of raiment, and thus hinder his noble work. And what if violent cold had set in, or rain had drenched it, or perhaps frozen in, how could he dry his raiment? Must he again remain without it? And what if cold had deprived his body of strength? Must he waste away with disease, and be unable to speak? For hear what he says to Timothy, to prove that they were not furnished with adamantine bodies, <q>Use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and your frequent infirmities.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1 Timothy 5:23</a></span> And again, when he speaks of another, <q>I counted it necessary to send to you your messenger, and minister to my needs.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse25">Philippians 2:25</a></span> <q>For indeed he was sick, near unto death; but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse27">Philippians 2:27</a></span> So that they were subject to every sort of sickness. What then? Must they die? By no means. For what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> then did Christ at that time give them that command? To show His own power, and to prove that in after times He was able to do it, though He did it not. But wherefore did He not do it? They were much more admirable than the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, whose shoes did not wax old, neither their garments, and that too while they were journeying through that desert where the glowing rays of the sun strike so hot, that they are capable of consuming even stones. <span class="stiki">cf. <a href="../bible/deu029.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy 29:5</a></span> Why then did he do this? For your sake. For since you would not remain in health, but be full of wounds, He gave you that which might serve for medicine. And this is hence manifest; could He not Himself have fed them? He that gave to you, who wast an enemy with Him, would He not much more have given to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? He who gave to the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, those murmurers, those fornicators, those idolaters, would He not much more have given to Peter, who spent all for His sake? He who suffered <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men to possess anything, would He not much more have freely given to John, who for Him forsook even his father? Yet he would not: through your hands he feeds them, that you may be sanctified. And see the excess of His lovingkindness. He chose that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> should be in want, that you might be a little refreshed.</p>

<p>For if He had freed them from all want, they would have been much more admirable, far more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. But then that which is to you <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> would have been cut off. God willed not then that they should be admirable, that you might be saved, but that they should rather be lowered. He has suffered them to be less accounted of, that you might be able to be saved. The Teacher who receives is not equally reverenced, but he who receives not is chiefly <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>. But then in the latter case the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is not benefited, he is hindered of his fruit. Do you see the wisdom of God who thus loves man? For as He Himself sought not His own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nor had respect to Himself, but when He was in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, chose to be dishonored for your sake, thus too is it in the case of your Teachers. When they might have been highly reverenced, He preferred that they should be subject to contempt for your sake, that you might be able to profit, that you might be able to be rich. For he is in want of the things of this life, that you may abound in things spiritual. If then He might have made them above all want, He showed that for your sake He suffers them to be in want. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> then these things, let us turn ourselves to well doing, not to accusations. Let us not be overcurious about the failings of others, but take account of our own; let us reckon up the excellences of other men, while we bear in mind our faults; and thus shall we be well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he who looks at the faults of others, and at his own excellences, is injured in two ways; by the latter he is carried up to arrogance, through the former he falls into listlessness. For when he perceives that such an one has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, very easily will he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> himself; when he perceives that he has in anything excelled, very easily becomes he arrogant. He who consigns to oblivion his own excellences, and looks at his failings only, while he is a curious enquirer of the excellences, not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, of others, is profited in many ways. And how? When he sees that such an one has done excellently, he is raised to emulate the same; when he sees that he himself has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, he is rendered <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and modest. If we act thus, if we thus regulate ourselves, we shall be able to obtain the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are promised, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom, etc.</p>
