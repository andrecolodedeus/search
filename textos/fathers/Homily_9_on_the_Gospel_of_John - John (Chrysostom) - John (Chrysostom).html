<h1>Homily 9 on the Gospel of John</h1>

<h2>John 1:11</h2> <div class="h2a"><q>He came unto His own, and His own received Him not.</q></div>

<p>1. If you remember our former reflections, we shall the more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> proceed with the building up  of what remains, as doing so for great gain. For so will our discourse be more intelligible to you who remember what has been already said, and we shall not need much labor, because you are able through your great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of learning to see more clearly into what remains. The man who is always losing what is given to him will always need a teacher, and will never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> anything; but he who retains what he has received, and so receives in addition what remains, will quickly be a teacher instead of a learner, and useful not only to himself, but to all others also; as, conjecturing from their great readiness to hear, I anticipate that this assembly will specially be. Come then, let us lay up in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as in a safe treasury, the Lord's money, and unfold, as far as the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit may afford us power, the words this day set before us.</p>

<p>He (St. John) had said, speaking of the old times, that <q>the world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> him not</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse10">John 1:10</a></span>; afterwards he comes down in his narrative to the times of the proclamation (of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>), and says, <q>He came to His own, and His own received Him not,</q> now calling the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <q>His own,</q> as His peculiar people, or perhaps even all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, as created by Him. And as above, when perplexed at the folly of the many, and ashamed of our common nature, he said that <q>the world by Him was made,</q> and having been made, did not recognize its Maker; so here again, being troubled beyond bearing  at the stupidity of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the many, he sets forth the charge in a yet more striking manner, saying, that <q>His own received Him not,</q> and that too when <q>He came to them.</q> And not only he, but the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> also, wondering, said the very same, as did afterwards <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, amazed at the very same things. Thus did the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> cry aloud in the person of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, saying, <q>A people whom I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, have served Me; as soon as they heard Me, they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> Me; the strange children have dealt <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> with Me.  The strange children have waxed aged, and have halted from their paths.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/psa017.htm#verse43">Psalm 18:43-45</a>, <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a></span> And again, <q>They to whom it had not been told concerning Him, shall see, and they which had not heard, shall understand.</q> And, <q>I was found of them that sought Me not</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse15">Isaiah 52:15</a></span>; <q>I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse1">Isaiah 45:1</a>, as quoted in <a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse20">Romans 10:20</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in his Epistles to the Romans, has said, <q>What then? <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has not obtained that which he seeks for: but the election has obtained it.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse7">Romans 11:7</a></span> And again; <q>What shall we say then? That the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> which followed not after righteousness, have attained unto righteousness: but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse30">Romans 9:30</a></span></p>

<p>For it is a thing indeed worthy of our amazement, how they who were nurtured in (<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of) the prophetical books, who heard <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> every day telling them ten thousand things concerning the coming of the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, and the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> afterwards, who moreover themselves beheld Christ Himself daily working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> among them, giving up His time  to them alone, neither as yet allowing His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to depart into the way of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, or to enter into a city of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a>, nor doing so Himself, but everywhere  declaring that He was sent to the lost sheep of the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse5">Matthew 10:5</a></span>: how, (I say), while they saw the signs, and heard the Prophets, and had Christ Himself continually putting them in remembrance, they yet made themselves once for all so blind and dull, as by none of these things to be brought to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse24">Matthew 15:24</a></span> While they of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who had enjoyed none of these things, who had never heard the oracles of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not, as one may say, so much as in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, but ever ranging among the fables of madmen, (for <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is this,) having ever in their hands  the sillinesses of their poets, nailed to stocks and stones, and neither in doctrines nor in conversation  possessing anything good or sound. (For their way of life was more impure and more accursed than their doctrine. As was likely; for when they saw their gods delighting in all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, worshipped by shameful words, and more shameful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, reckoning this festivity and praise, and moreover <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by foul murders, and child-slaughters, how should not they emulate these things?) Still, fallen as they were as low as the very depth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, on a  sudden, as by the agency of some machine, they have appeared to us shining from on high, and from the very summit of heaven.</p>

<p>How then and whence came it to pass? Hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> telling you. For that blessed person searching exactly into these things, ceased not until he had found the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and had declared it to all others. What then is it? And whence came such blindness upon the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? Hear him who was entrusted with this stewardship declare. What then does he say in resolving this <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of the many? <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 9:17</a></span> <q>For they,</q> says he, <q>being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans 10:3</a></span> Wherefore they have suffered this. And again, explaining the same matter in other terms, he says, <q>What shall we say then? That the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> which followed not after righteousness, have attained unto righteousness, even the righteousness which is of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness. Wherefore? Because they sought it not by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For they stumbled at that stumbling stone.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse30">Romans 9:30-32</a></span> His meaning is this: <q>These men's unbelief has been the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their misfortunes, and their haughtiness was parent of their unbelief.</q> For when having before enjoyed greater privileges than the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>,  through having received the law, through <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the rest which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> enumerates, they after the coming of Christ saw the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and themselves called on equal terms through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and after <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> received one of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> in nothing preferred to the Gentile, they came to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and were stung by their haughtiness, and could not endure the unspeakable and exceeding lovingkindness of the Lord. So this has happened to them from nothing else but <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and unkindness.</p>

<p>2. For in what, O most foolish of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, are you injured by the care  bestowed on others? How are your blessings made less through having others to share the same? But of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is blind, and cannot readily perceive anything that it ought. Being therefore stung by the prospect of having others to share the same confidence,  they thrust a sword against themselves, and cast themselves out from the lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And with good reason. For He says, <q>Friend, I do you no wrong, I will give to 'these also' even as unto you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse14">Matthew 20:14</a></span> Or rather, these <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> are not deserving even of these words. For the man in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> if he was discontented, could yet speak of the labors and weariness, the heat and sweat, of a whole day. But what could these men have to tell? Nothing like this, but slothfulness and profligacy and ten thousand <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things of which all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> continued ever to accuse them, and by which they like the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> had offended against God. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declaring this says, <q>For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: For all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and come short of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God: being justified freely by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse12">Romans 10:12</a>; <a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse22">Romans 3:22-24</a></span> And on this head he treats profitably and very wisely throughout that Epistle. But in a former part of it he proves that they are worthy of still greater punishment. <q>For as many as have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the law shall be judged by the law</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse12">Romans 2:12</a></span>; that is to say, more severely, as having for their accuser the law as well as nature. And not for this only, but for that they have been the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that God is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>: <q>My  Name,</q> He says, <q>is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> through you.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse24">Romans 2:24</a>; <a href="../bible/isa052.htm#verse5">Isaiah 52:5</a></span></p>

<p>Since now this it was that stung them most, (for the thing appeared incredible even to those of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and therefore they brought it as a charge against Peter, when he had come up to them from Cesarea, that he <q>went in to men uncircumcised, and did eat with them</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act011.htm#verse3">Acts 11:3</a></span>; and after that they had learned the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even so still  they wondered how <q>on the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> also was poured out the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse45">Acts 10:45</a></span>: showing by their astonishment that they could never have expected so incredible a thing,) since then he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that this touched them nearest, see how he has emptied  their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and relaxed  their highly swelling insolence. For after having discoursed on the case of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>,  and shown that they had not from any quarter any excuse, or hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and after having definitely charged them both with the perversion  of their doctrines and the uncleanness of their lives, he shifts his argument to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; and  after recounting all the expressions of the Prophet, in which he had said that they were polluted, treacherous, <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritical</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and had <q>altogether become unprofitable,</q> that there was <q>none</q> among them <q>that seeks after <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> that they had <q>all gone out of the way</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse12">Romans 3:12</a></span>, and the like, he adds, <q>Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what things soever the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse19">Romans 3:19</a></span> <q>For all have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and come short of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse23">Romans 3:23</a></span></p> 

<p>Why then exaltest you yourself, O Jew? Why are you high minded? For your mouth also is stopped, your boldness also is taken away, you also with all the world have become guilty, and, like others, are placed in need of being justified freely. You ought surely even if you had stood upright and had had great boldness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not even so to have envied those who should be pitied and saved through His lovingkindness. This is the extreme of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, to pine at the blessings of others; especially when this was to be effected without any loss of yours. If indeed the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others had been prejudicial to your advantages, your grieving might have been reasonable; though not even then would it have been so to one who had learned <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom.  But if your reward is not increased by the punishment of another, nor diminished by his welfare, why do you bewail yourself because that other is freely saved? As I said, you ought not, even were thou (one) of the approved, to be pained at the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which comes to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. But when you, who are guilty before your Lord of the same things as they, and have yourself offended, are displeased at the good of others, and think great things, as if you alone ought to be partaker of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, you are guilty not only of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and insolence, but of extreme folly, and may be liable to all the severest torments; for you have planted within yourself the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</p>

<p>Wherefore a wise man has said, <q>Pride is the beginning of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse13">Sirach 10:13</a></span>: that is, its root, its source, its mother. By this the first created was banished from that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> abode: by this the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who deceived him had fallen from that height of dignity; from which that accursed one, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was sufficient to cast down even from heaven itself, came this way when he labored to bring down <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> from such high <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. For having puffed him up with the promise that he should be as a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so he broke him down, and cast him down into the very gulfs of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.  Because nothing so alienates men from the lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and gives them over to the fire of the pit,  as the tyranny of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For when this is present with us, our whole life becomes impure, even though we fulfill <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, almsgiving, anything. For, <q>Every one,</q> says the wise man, <q>that is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> in heart is an abomination  to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/pro016.htm#verse5">Proverbs 16:5</a></span> Let us then restrain this swelling of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, let us cut up by the roots this lump of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, if at least we would wish to be clean, and to escape the punishment appointed for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For that the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> must fall under the same punishment as that (<a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>) one, hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> declare; <q>Not a novice, lest being lifted up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, he fall into the judgment, and the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q>  What is <q>the judgment</q>?  He means, into the same <q>condemnation,</q> the same punishment. How then does he say, that a man may avoid this dreadful thing? By reflecting upon  his own nature, upon the number of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, upon the greatness of the torments in that place, upon the transitory nature of the things which seem bright in this world, differing in nothing from grass, and more fading than the flowers of spring. If we continually stir within ourselves these considerations, and keep in mind those who have walked most upright, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, though he strive ten thousand ways, will not be able to lift  us up, nor even to trip  us at all.
