<h1>Homily on Ephesians</h1>

<p>Ephesus is the metropolis of Asia. It was dedicated to Diana, whom especially they worshipped there as their great goddess. Indeed so great was the <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> of her worshippers, that when her temple was burnt, they would not so much as divulge the name of the man who burnt it.</p>

<p>The blessed John the Evangelist spent the chief part of his time there: he was there when he was banished,  and there he died. It was there too that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> left Timothy, as he says in writing to him, <q>As I exhorted you to tarry at Ephesus.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse3">1 Timothy 1:3</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> also, those more particularly who flourished in Asia, were there; and even Pythagoras himself is said to have come from thence; perhaps because Samos, whence he really came, is an island of Ionia.  It was the resort also of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Parmenides, and Zeno, and Democritus, and you may see a number of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> there even to the present day.</p>

<p>These facts I mention, not merely as such, but with a view of showing that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> would needs take great pains and trouble in writing to these Ephesians. He is said indeed to have entrusted them, as being <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> already well-instructed, with his profoundest conceptions; and the Epistle itself is full of sublime thoughts and doctrines. </p>

<p>He wrote the Epistle from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and, as he himself informs us, in bonds. <q>Pray for me, that utterance may be given unto me, in opening my mouth to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> with boldness the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, for which I am an ambassador in chains.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse19">Ephesians 6:19</a></span> It abounds with sentiments of overwhelming loftiness and grandeur. Thoughts which he scarcely so much as utters any where else, he here plainly declares; as when he says, <q>To the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> through the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the manifold wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse10">Ephesians 3:10</a></span> And again; <q>He raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in heavenly places.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse6">Ephesians 2:6</a></span> And again; <q>Which in other generations was not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as it has now been revealed unto His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are fellow-heirs, and fellow-partakers of the promise in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse5">Ephesians 3:5</a></span></p>
