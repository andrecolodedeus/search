<h1>Homily on "Father, if it be possible..."</h1>

<p><strong>Against Marcionists and Manich&aelig;ans</strong></p>

<p>On the passage <q>Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me, nevertheless not as I will but as you will:</q> and against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionists</a> and <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>: also, that we ought not to rush into danger, but to prefer the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> before every other will.</p>

<p>1. I lately inflicted a severe stroke upon those who are grasping and wish to overreach others;  I did this not in order to wound them but in order to correct them; not because I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the men, but because I detest their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. For so the physician also lances the abscess, not as making an attack upon the suffering body, but as a means of contending with the disorder and the wound. Well today let us grant them a little respite, that they may recover from their distress, and not recoil from the remedy by being perpetually afflicted. Physicians also act thus; after the use of the knife they apply plasters and drugs, and let a few days pass while they devise things to allay the pain. Following their example let me today, devising means for them to derive benefit from my discourse, start a question concerning doctrine, directing my speech to the words which have been read. For I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that many feel perplexed as to the reason why these words were uttered by Christ: and it is probable also that any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who are present may pounce upon the words, and thereby upset many of the more simple-minded brethren.</p>

<p>In order then to build a wall against their attack and to relieve those who are in perplexity from bewilderment and confusion, let us take in hand the words which have been cited, and dwell upon the passage, and dive into the depths of its meanings. For reading does not suffice unless <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also be added to it. Even as the eunuch of Candace read, but until one came who instructed him in the meaning of what he was reading he derived no great benefit from it. In order therefore that you may not be in the same condition attend to what is said, exert your understanding, let me have your mind disengaged from other thoughts, let your eye be quick-sighted, your intention earnest: let your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be set free from worldly cares, that we may not sow our words upon the thorns, or upon the rock, or by the way side, but that we may till a deep and rich field, and so reap an abundant harvest. For if you thus attend to what is said you will render my labour lighter and facilitate the discovery of that which you are seeking.</p>

<p>What then is the meaning of the passage which has been read <q>Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me?</q> What does the saying mean? For we ought to unlock the passage by first giving a clear interpretation of the words. What then does the saying mean? <q>Father if it be possible take away the cross.</q> How do you say? Is he <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> whether this be possible or impossible? Who would venture to say this? Yet the words are those of one who is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>: for the addition of the word <q>if,</q> is indicative of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>: but as I said we must not attend to the words merely, but turn our attention to the sense, and learn the aim of the speaker, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and the occasion, and by putting all these things together turn out the hidden meaning. The unspeakable Wisdom then, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Father even as the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, how should he have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this? For this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> was not greater than the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> concerning His essential nature, which He alone accurately <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. <q>For as the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> me</q> He says <q>even so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190630"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;10:15</a></span> And why do I speak of the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? For even the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> appear not to have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this fact, but to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it clearly, and to have declared beforehand with much assurance that so it must come to pass, and would certainly be.</p>

<p>Hear at least how variously all announce the cross. First of all the patriarch Jacob: for directing his discourse to Him he says <q>Out of a tender shoot did you spring up:</q>  by the word shoot signifying the Virgin and the undefiled nature of Mary. Then indicating the cross he said <q>You lied down and slumber as a lion, and as a lion's cub; who shall raise him up?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190632"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse9"> <em>Ibid</em></a></span> Here he called death a slumbering and a sleep, and with death he combined the resurrection when he said <q>who shall raise him up?</q> No one indeed save he himself&mdash; wherefore also Christ said <q>I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190633"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;10:18</a></span> and again <q>Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190634"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> And what is meant by the words <q>you lied down and slumber as a lion?</q> For as the lion is terrible not only when he is awake but even when he is sleeping, so Christ also not only before the cross but also on the cross itself and in the very moment of death was terrible, and wrought at that time great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, turning back the light of the sun, cleaving the rocks, shaking the earth, rending the veil, alarming the wife of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a>, convicting Judas of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for then he said <q>I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in that I have betrayed the innocent blood;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190635"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;27:4</a></span> and the wife of <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> declared <q>Have nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered many things in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> because of Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190636"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;27:19</a></span> The darkness took possession of the earth, and night appeared at midday, then death was brought to nought, and his tyranny was destroyed: many bodies at least of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which slept arose. These things the patriarch declaring beforehand, and demonstrating that, even when crucified, Christ would be terrible, said <q>you lied down and slumber as a lion.</q> He did not say you shall slumber but you slumbered, because it would certainly come to pass. For it is the custom of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in many places to predict things to come as if they were already past. For just as it is impossible that things which have happened should not have happened, so is it impossible that this should not happen, although it be future. On this account they predict things to come under the semblance of past time, indicating by this means the impossibility of their failure, the certainty of their coming to pass. So also spoke David, signifying the cross; <q>They pierced my hands and my feet.</q>  He did not say they <q>shall pierce</q> but <q>they pierced</q> <q>they counted all my bones.</q>  And not only does he say this, but he also describes the things which were done by the soldiers. <q>They parted my garments among themselves, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</q>  And not only this but he also relates they gave Him gall to eat, and vinegar to drink. For he says <q>they gave me gall for my food, and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</q>  And again another one says that they smote him with a spear, for <q>they shall look on Him whom they pierced.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190641"><a href="../bible/zec012.htm#verse10">Zechariah&nbsp;12:10</a></span> Esaias again in another fashion predicting the cross said <q>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, so opens he not his mouth.</q> <q>In his humiliation his judgment was taken away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190642"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7-8</a></span> </p>

<p>2. Now observe I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> how each one of these writers speaks as if concerning things already past, signifying by the use of this tense the absolute inevitable certainty of the event. So also David, describing this tribunal, said, <q>Why did the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rage and the people <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> vain things? The Kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.</q>  And not only does he mention the trial, and the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and the incidents on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, but also him who betrayed him, declaring that he was his familiar companion and guest. <q>For,</q> he says, <q>he that eats bread with me did magnify his heel against me.</q>  Thus also does he foretell the voice which Christ was to utter on the cross saying <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, My God why have you forsaken me?</q>  and the burial also does he describe: <q>They laid me in the lowest pit, in dark places, and in the shadow of death.</q>  And the resurrection: <q>you shall not leave my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, neither shall you suffer your Holy One to see corruption;</q>  and the ascension: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has gone up with a merry noise, the Lord with the sound of the trump.</q>  And the session on the right hand: <q>The Lord said to my Lord sit thou on my right hand until I make your foes your footstool.</q>  But Esaias also declares the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; saying, <q>for the transgressions of my people is He brought to death,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190650"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;53:8</a></span> and because all have strayed like sheep, therefore is he <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note190651"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;53:6-7</a></span> Then also he adds mention of the result, saying <q>by his stripes we have all been healed:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190652"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;53:5</a></span> and <q>he has borne the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of many.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190653"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;53:12</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> then <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the cross and that which was effected by it, and the burial and the resurrection, and the ascension, and the betrayal, and the trial, and described them all with accuracy: and is He who sent them and commanded them to speak these things <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them Himself? What reasonable man would say that? Do you see that we must not attend merely to the words? For this is not the only perplexing passage, but what follows is more perplexing. For what does He say? <q>Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me.</q> Here he will be found to speak not only as if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, but as if deprecating the cross: For this is what He says. <q>If it be permissible let me not be subjected to crucifixion and death.</q> And yet when Peter, the leader of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, said this to Him, <q>Be it far from you Lord, this shall not happen unto You,</q> He rebuked him so severely as to say; <q>get you behind me <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, you are an offense unto me, for you savour not the things which be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but those which be of men:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190654"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;16:22-23</a></span> although a short time before he had pronounced him blessed. But to escape crucifixion seemed to Him so monstrous a thing, that him who had received the revelation from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, him whom He had pronounced blessed, him who had received the keys of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, He called <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and an offense, and accused him of not savouring the things which be of God because he said to Him, <q>Be it far from you Lord, this shall never be unto You</q>&mdash; namely crucifixion. He then who thus vituperated the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and poured such an invective upon him as actually to call him <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> (after having bestowed such great praise on him), because he said <q>avoid crucifixion,</q> how could He desire not to be crucified? And how after these things when drawing the picture of the good shepherd could He declare this to be the special <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that he should be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> for the sake of the sheep, thus saying, <q>I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190655"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;10:11</a></span> Nor did He even stop there, but also added, <q>but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep, and flees.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190656"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;10:12</a></span> If then it is the sign of the good shepherd to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> himself, and of the hireling to be unwilling to undergo this, how can He who calls Himself the good shepherd beseech that he may not be <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>? And how could He say <q>I lay down my life of myself</q>? For if you lay down your life of yourself, how can you beseech another that you may not lay it down? And how is it that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> marvels at Him on account of this declaration, saying <q>Who being in the form of God counted it not a prize to be on an equality with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but emptied Himself taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself, becoming <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190657"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6-8</a></span> And He Himself again speaks in this wise, <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> does my Father <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190658"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;10:17</a></span> For if He does not desire to lay it down, but deprecates the act, and beseeches the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, how is it that He is loved on this account? For <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is of those who are like minded. And how does <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> say again <q>Love one another even as Christ also loved us and gave Himself for us?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190659"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;5:2</a></span> And Christ Himself when He was about to be crucified said <q>Father, the hour has come: glorify your Son,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190660"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;17:1</a></span> speaking of the cross as <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>: and how then does He deprecate it here when He urges it there? For that the cross is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> listen to what the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190661"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;7:39</a></span> Now the hearing of this expression is <q><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was not yet given because the enmity towards men was not yet destroyed by reason that the cross had not yet done its work.</q> For the cross destroyed the enmity of God towards man, brought about the reconciliation, made the earth <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, associated men with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, pulled down the citadel of death, unstrung the force of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, extinguished the power of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, delivered the world from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, brought back the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, expelled the Demons, destroyed temples, overturned altars, suppressed the sacrificial offering, implanted <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, founded the Churches. The cross is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the rejoicing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, the boast of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>for,</q> he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should boast save in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190662"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> The cross is that which is brighter than the sun, more brilliant than the sunbeam: for when the sun is darkened then the cross shines brightly: and the sun is darkened not because it is extinguished, but because it is overpowered by the brilliancy of the cross. The cross has broken our bond, it has made the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> of death ineffectual, it is the demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190663"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;3:16</a></span> And again <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says <q>If being enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190664"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;5:10</a></span> The cross is the impregnable wall, the invulnerable shield, the safeguard of the rich, the resource of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, the defence of those who are exposed to snares, the armour of those who are attacked, the means of suppressing passion, and of acquiring <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the wonderful and marvellous sign. <q>For this generation seeks after a sign: and no sign shall be given it save the sign of Jonas;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190665"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;12:39</a></span> and again <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, <q>for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> ask for a sign and the Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190666"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:22</a></span> The cross opened Paradise, it brought in the robber, it conducted into the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> the race of man which was about to perish, and was not worthy even of earth. So great are the benefits which have sprung and do spring from the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and yet does He not desire to be crucified I ask? Who would venture to say this? And if He did not desire it who compelled Him, who forced Him to it? And why did He send <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> beforehand announcing that He would be crucified, if He was not to be, and did not wish to undergo it? And for what reason does He call the cross a cup, if He did not desire to be crucified? For that is the word of one who signifies the desire which he has concerning the act. For as the cup is sweet to those who are thirsty so also was crucifixion to Him: wherefore also He said <q>With desire have I desired to eat this <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> with you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190667"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;22:15</a></span> and this He meant not absolutely, but relatively, because after that evening the cross was awaiting Him.</p>

<p>3. He then who calls the thing <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and rebukes the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> because he was trying to hinder Him, and proves that what constitutes the good shepherd is his <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> himself on behalf of the sheep, and declares that he earnestly longs for this thing, and willingly goes to meet it, how is it that He beseeches it may not come to pass? And if He did not wish it what difficulty was there in hindering those who came for that purpose? But in fact you behold Him hastening towards the deed. At least when they came upon Him He said <q>Whom do you seek?</q> and they replied <q>Jesus.</q> Then He says to them <q>Lo! I am He: and they went backward and fell to the ground.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190668"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;18:6</a></span> Thus having first crippled them and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that He was able to escape their hands, He then surrendered Himself, that you might learn that not by compulsion or force, or the tyrannical power of those who attacked Him, did He unwillingly submit to this, but willingly with purpose and desire, preparing for it a long time before. Therefore also were <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> sent beforehand, and patriarchs foretold the events, and by means of words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> the cross was prefigured. For the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Isaac also signified the cross to us: wherefore also Christ said <q><a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> your father rejoiced to see my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and he saw it and was glad.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190669"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56</a></span> The patriarch then was glad beholding the image of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and does He Himself deprecate it? Thus <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also prevailed over Amalek when he displayed the figure of the cross: and one may observe countless things happening in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> descriptive by anticipation of the cross. For what reason then was this the case if He who was to be crucified did not wish it to come to pass? And the sentence which follows this is yet more perplexing. For having said Let this cup pass from me He added <q>nevertheless not as I will but as You will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190670"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;26:39</a></span> For herein as far as the actual expression is concerned we find two wills opposed to one another: if at least the Father desires Him to be crucified, but He Himself does not desire it. And yet we everywhere behold Him desiring and purposing the same things as the Father. For when He says <q>grant to them, as I and Thou are one that they also may be one in us,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190671"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;17:11</a></span> it is equivalent to saying that the purpose of the Father and of the Son is one. And when He says <q>The words which I speak I speak not myself, but the Father which dwells in me, He does these works,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190672"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;14:10</a></span> He indicates the same thing. And when He says <q>I have not come of myself</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190673"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;7:28</a></span> and <q>I can of my own self do nothing</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190674"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;5:30</a></span> he does not say this as signifying that He has been deprived of authority, either to speak or to act (away with the thought!), but as desiring to prove the concord of his purpose, both in words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and in every kind of transaction, to be one and the same with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as I have already frequently demonstrated. For the expression <q>I speak not of myself</q> is not an abrogation of authority but a demonstration of agreement. How then does He say here <q>Nevertheless not as I will but as You will</q>? Perhaps I have excited a great conflict in your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but be on the alert: for although many words have been uttered I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well that your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> is still fresh: for the discourse is now hastening on to the solution. Why then has this form of speech been employed? Attend carefully, The doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> was very hard to receive. For the exceeding measure of His lovingkindness and the magnitude of His condescension  were full of awe, and needed much preparation to be accepted. For consider what a great thing it was to hear and to learn that God the ineffable, the incorruptible, the unintelligible, the invisible, the incomprehensible, in whose hand are the ends of the earth,  who looks upon the earth, and causes it to tremble, who touches the mountains, and makes them smoke,  the weight of whose condescension not even the Cherubim were able to bear but veiled their faces by the shelter of their wings, that this God who surpasses all understanding, and baffles all calculation, having passed by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, archangels, and all the spiritual powers above, deigned to become man, and to take flesh formed of earth and clay, and enter the womb of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and be borne there the space of nine months, and be nourished with milk, and suffer all things to which man is liable. Inasmuch then as that which was to happen was so strange as to be disbelieved by many even when it had taken place, He first of all sends <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> beforehand, announcing this very fact. For instance the patriarch predicted it saying <q>You sprang from a tender shoot my son: you lied down and slumber as a lion;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190677"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse9">Genesis&nbsp;49:9</a></span> and Esaias saying <q>Behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and they shall call His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190678"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> and elsewhere again <q>We beheld Him as a young child, as a root in a dry ground;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190679"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;53:2</a></span> and by the dry ground he means the virgin's womb. And again <q>unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190680"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;9:6</a></span> and again <q>there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall spring out of his root.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190681"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;11:1</a></span> And Baruch in the book of Jeremiah says <q>this is our God: no other shall be reckoned by the side of Him: He found out every path of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and gave it to Jacob His servant, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> his beloved. After these things also He appeared upon the earth, and held converse with men.</q>  And David signifying His incarnate presence said <q>He shall come down like the rain into a fleece of wool, and like the drop which distills upon the earth</q>  because He noiselessly and gently entered into the Virgin's womb.</p>

<p>4. But these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> alone did not suffice, but even when He had come, lest what had taken place should be deemed an illusion, He warranted the fact not only by the sight but by duration of time and by passing through all the phases incident to man. For He did not enter once for all into a man matured and completely developed, but into a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> womb, so as to undergo the process of gestation and birth and suckling and growth, and by the length of the time and the variety of the stages of growth to give assurance of what had come to pass. And not even here were the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> concluded, but even when bearing about the body of flesh He suffered it to experience the infirmities of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and to be hungry, and thirsty, and to sleep and feel fatigue; finally also when He came to the cross He suffered it to undergo the pains of the flesh. For this reason also streams of sweat flowed down from it and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was discovered strengthening it, and He was sad and down-cast: for before He uttered these words He said <q>my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is troubled, and exceeding sorrowful ever unto death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190684"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38</a></span> If then after all these things have taken place the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> mouth of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> speaking through <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, and Manich&aelig;us of <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and many more <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, has attempted to overthrow the doctrine of the Incarnation and has vented a diabolical utterance declaring that He did not become flesh, nor was clothed with it, but that this was mere fancy, and illusion, a piece of acting and pretence, although the sufferings, the death, the burial, the thirst, cry aloud against this teaching; supposing that none of these things had happened would not the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> have sown these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doctrines of impiousness much more widely? For this reason, just as He hungered, as He slept, as He felt fatigue, as He ate and drank, so also did He deprecate death, thereby manifesting his humanity, and that infirmity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which does not submit without pain to be torn from this present life. For had He not uttered any of these things, it might have been said that if He were a man He ought to have experienced <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feelings. And what are these? In the case of one about to be crucified, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and agony, and pain in being torn from present life: for a sense of the charm which surrounds present things is implanted in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: on this account wishing to prove the reality of the fleshly clothing, and to give assurance of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> He manifests the actual feelings of man with full demonstration.</p>

<p>This is one consideration, but there is another no less important. And what is this? Christ having come to earth wished to instruct men in all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: now the instructor teaches not only by word, but also by deed: for this is the teacher's best method of teaching. A pilot for instance when he makes the apprentice sit by his side shows him how he handles the rudder, but he also joins speech to action, and does not depend upon words alone or example alone: in like manner also an architect when he has placed by his side the man who is intended to learn from him how a wall is constructed, shows him the way by means of action as well as by means of oral teaching; so also with the weaver, and embroiderer, and gold refiner, and coppersmith&mdash;and every kind of art has teachers who instruct both orally and practically. Inasmuch then as Christ Himself came to instruct us in all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, He both tells us what ought to be done, and does it. <q>For,</q> he says, <q>he who does and teaches the same shall be called great in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190685"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;5:19</a></span> Now observe; He commanded men to be lowly-minded, and meek, and He taught this by His words: but see how He also teaches it by His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. For having said <q>Blessed are the poor in spirit, blessed are the meek,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190686"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;5:3-4</a></span> He shows how these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> ought to be practised. How then did He teach them? He took a towel and girded Himself and washed the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet. <span class="stiki" id="note190687"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;13:4-5</a></span> What can match this lowliness of mind? For He teaches this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> no longer by His words only but also by His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Again He teaches meekness and forbearance by His acts. How so? He was struck on the face by the servant of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, and said <q>If I have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: but if well why do you smite me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190688"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;18:23</a></span> He commanded men to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for their enemies: this also again He teaches by means of His acts: for when He had ascended the cross He said <q>Father forgive them for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190689"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> As therefore He commanded men to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> so does He Himself <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, instructing you to do so by his own unflagging utterances of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Again He commanded us to do good to those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us, and to deal fairly with those who treat us despitefully: <span class="stiki" id="note190690"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse44">Matthew&nbsp;5:44</a></span> and this He did by his own acts: for he cast devils out of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, who said that He Himself was possessed by a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, He bestowed benefits on His persecutors, He fed those who were forming designs against Him, He conducted into His kingdom those who were desiring to crucify Him. Again He said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <q>Get you no gold nor silver neither brass in your purses,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190691"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;10:9</a></span> thus training them for poverty: and this also He taught by His example, thus saying, <q>Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests, but the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has not where to lay His head.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190692"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;8:20</a></span> And He had neither table nor dwelling nor anything else of that kind: not because He was at a loss to obtain them, but because He was instructing men to go in that path. After the same manner then he taught them also to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. They said to Him <q>Teach us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190693"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;11:1</a></span> Therefore also He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, in order that they may learn to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. But it was necessary for them not merely to learn to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> but also how they ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: for this reason He delivered to them a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in this form: <q>Our Father which art in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> hallowed be your name, Your kingdom come: Your will be done, as in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, so on earth. Give us this day our daily bread: and forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors: and lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190694"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;11:2-4</a></span> that is into danger, into snares. Since then He commanded them to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <q>lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> He instructs them in this very precept by putting it in practice Himself, saying <q>Father if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me,</q> thus teaching all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> not to plunge into dangers, not to fling themselves into them but to wait for their approach, and to exhibit all possible <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, only not to rush forwards themselves, or to be the first to advance against terrors. Why so, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>? Both to teach us lowliness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and also to deliver us from the charge of vainglory. On this account it is said also in this passage that when He had spoken these words <q>He went away and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>:</q> and after He had <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> He speaks thus to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <q>Could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190695"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;26:39-41</a></span> Do you see He not only <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> but also admonishes? <q>For the Spirit indeed is willing,</q> He said, <q>but the flesh is weak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190696"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a></span> Now this He said by way of emptying their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of vanity, and delivering them from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, teaching them self-restraint, training them to practice moderation. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which He wished to teach them, He Himself also offered, speaking after the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not according to His Godhead (for the divine nature is impassable) but according to His manhood. And He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> as instructing us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and even to seek deliverance from distress; but, if this be not permitted, then to acquiesce in what seems good to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore He said <q>Nevertheless not as I will but as You will:</q> not because He had one will and the Father another; but in order that He might instruct men even if they were in distress and trembling, even if danger came upon them, and they were unwilling to be torn from present life, nevertheless to postpone their own will to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>: even as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also when he had been instructed practically exhibited both these principles; for he besought that <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> might be removed from him, thus saying <q>For this thing I besought the Lord thrice:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190697"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:8</a></span> and yet since it did not please God to remove it, he says <q>Wherefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in insults, in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190698"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:10</a></span> But perhaps what I have said is not quite clear: therefore I will make it clearer. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> incurred many dangers and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that he might not be exposed to them. Then he heard Christ saying <q>my <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190699"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:9</a></span> As soon then as he saw what the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was, he in future submitted his will to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. By means of this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> then Christ taught both these truths, that we should not plunge into dangers, but rather <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may not fall into them; but if they come upon us we should bear them bravely, and postpone our own will to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> these things then let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may never enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>: but if we do enter it let us beseech God to give us patience and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and let us <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> in preference to every will of our own. For then we shall pass through this present life with safety, and shall obtain the blessings to come: which may we all receive by the favour and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with Whom be to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, might, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, now and for ever world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
