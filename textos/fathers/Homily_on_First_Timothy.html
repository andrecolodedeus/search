<h1>Homily on First Timothy</h1>

<p>1. Timothy too  was one of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>. To the extraordinary qualities of this youth testimony is borne by Luke, who informs us, that he was <q>well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse2">Acts 16:2</a></span> He became at once a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> and a teacher, and gave this singular instance of his <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, that hearing <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preach without insisting upon <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, and understanding that he had formerly withstood Peter upon that point, he chose not only not to preach against it, but to submit to that rite. For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, it is said, <q>took and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> him</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse3">Acts 16:3</a></span>, though he was of adult age, and so trusted him with his whole economy. </p>

<p>The affection of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> for him is a sufficient evidence of his character. For he elsewhere says of him, <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of him, that as a son with a father, he has served with me in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse22">Philippians 2:22</a></span> And to the Corinthians again he writes: <q>I have sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse17">1 Corinthians 4:17</a></span> And again: <q>Let no man despise him, for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse10">1 Corinthians 16:10-11</a></span> And to the Hebrews he writes, <q>Know that our brother Timothy is set at liberty.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse23">Hebrews 13:23</a></span> Indeed his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for him is everywhere apparent, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>  that are now wrought still attest his claims. </p>

<p>2. If it should be asked why he addresses Epistles to Titus and Timothy alone, though Silas was approved, as also was Luke, for he writes, <q>Only Luke is with me</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse11">2 Timothy 4:11</a></span>, and Clement was one of his associates, of whom he says, <q>with Clement and other my fellow-laborers</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse3">Philippians 4:3</a></span>, for what reason then does he write only to Titus and Timothy? It is because he had already committed the care of churches to these, and certain marked  places had been assigned to them, but the others were in attendance upon him. For so pre&euml;minent in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was Timothy, that his youth was no impediment to his promotion; therefore he writes, <q>Let no man despise your youth</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse12">1 Timothy 4:12</a>, and <a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse2">5:2</a></span>; and again, <q>The younger <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as sisters.</q>  For where there is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, all other things are superfluous, and there can be no impediment. Therefore when the Apostle discourses of Bishops, among the many things he requires of them, he makes no particular mention of age. And if he speaks of a Bishop <q>being the husband of one wife,</q> and <q>having his children in subjection</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1 Timothy 3:2-4</a></span>, this is not said, as if it were necessary he should have a wife and children; but that if any should happen from a secular life to be advanced to that office, they might be such as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> how to preside over their household and children, and all others committed to them. For if a man were both secular and deficient in these points, how should he be  entrusted with the care of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>?</p>

<p>3. But why, you will say, does he address an Epistle to a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> already appointed to the office of a Teacher? Ought he not to have been made perfect for his office, before he was sent? Yes; but the instruction which he needed was not that which was suited to a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, but that which was proper for a Teacher. You will perceive him therefore through the whole Epistle adapting his instructions to a Teacher. Thus at the very beginning he does not say, <q>Do not attend to those who teach otherwise,</q> but, <q>Charge them that they teach no other doctrine.</q> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse3">1 Timothy 1:3</a></span></p>
