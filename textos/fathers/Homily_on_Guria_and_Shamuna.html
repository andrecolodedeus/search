<h1>Homily on Guria and Shamuna</h1>

<p>Shamuna and Guria, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> who made themselves illustrious in their afflictions,</p>

<p class="indent">Have in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> required of me to tell of their illustrious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</p>

<p>To champions of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the doctrine calls me,</p>

<p class="indent">That I should go and behold their contests and their crowns.</p>

<p>Children of the right hand, who have done battle against the left,</p>

<p class="indent">Have called me this day to recite the marvellous tale of their conflicts:&mdash; </p>

<p>Simple old men, who entered into the fight like heroes,</p>

<p class="indent">And nobly distinguished themselves in the strife of blood:</p>

<p>Those who were the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of our land, and it was sweetened thereby,</p>

<p class="indent">And its savour was restored, which had become insipid through unbelief:</p>

<p>Candlesticks of gold, which were full of the oil of the crucifixion,</p>

<p class="indent">By which was lighted up all our region, which had turned to darkness:</p>

<p>Two lamps, of which, when all the winds were blowing</p>

<p class="indent">Of every <em>kind of</em> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the lights were not put out;</p>

<p>Good labourers, who from the spring of day laboured</p>

<p class="indent">In the blessed vineyard of the house of God right duteously:</p>

<p>Bulwarks of our land, who became to us as it were a defence</p>

<p class="indent">Against all spoilers in all the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> that surrounded us:</p>

<p>Havens of peace, a place also of retreat for all that were distressed,</p>

<p class="indent">And a resting-place for the head of every one that was in need of succour:</p>

<p>Two precious pearls, which were</p>

<p class="indent">An ornament for the bride of my lord <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a>, the Aram&aelig;an's son.</p>

<p>Teachers they were who practised their teaching in blood,</p>

<p class="indent">And whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their sufferings.</p>

<p>On their bodies they wrote the story of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></p>

<p class="indent">With <em>the marks of</em> combs and scourges which thickly covered them.</p>

<p>They showed their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, not by words of the mouth alone,</p>

<p class="indent">But by tortures and by the rending of their limbs asunder.</p>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> they gave up their bodies:</p>

<p class="indent">Since it beseems the lover that for his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he should give up himself.</p>

<p>Fire and sword <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <em>it was;</em></p>

<p class="indent">And more beautiful than silver tried in <em>a furnace of</em> earth were their necks.</p>

<p>They looked on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, because they saw His exalted beauties,</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore did they look with contempt upon their sufferings for His sake.</p>

<p>The Sun of righteousness had arisen in their hearts;</p>

<p>And they were enlightened by it, and with <em>His</em> light chased they away the darkness.</p>

<p>At the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of vanity, which <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> had brought in, they laughed,</p>

<p class="indent">Instinct with the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> which is full of light.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Lord was as a fire in their hearts;</p>

<p class="indent">Nor could all the brambles of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> stand before it.</p>

<p>Fixed was their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> on God unchangeably: </p>

<p>And therefore did they look with scorn upon the sword,  all thirsty as it was for blood.</p>

<p>With guilelessness and <em>yet with</em> wisdom stood they in the judgment-hall,</p>

<p class="indent">As they had been commanded by the Teacher of that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>

<p>Despising as they did kindred and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, guileless were they;</p>

<p class="indent">Forasmuch, also, as possessions and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> were held in no account by them.</p>

<p> <em>Nor guileless only:</em> for in the judgment-hall with the wisdom of serpents <em>too</em></p>

<p class="indent">They were heedful of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>When a serpent is seized and struck, he guards his head,</p>

<p class="indent">But gives up and leaves exposed all his body to his captors:</p>

<p>And, so long as his head is kept <em>from harm</em>, his life abides in him;</p>

<p class="indent">But, if the head be struck, his life is left <em>a prey</em> to destruction.</p>

<p>The head of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is men's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">And, if this be preserved <em>unharmed</em>, by it is also preserved their life: </p>

<p>Even though the whole body be lacerated with blows,</p>

<p class="indent"> <em>Yet</em>, so long as <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is preserved, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is alive;</p>

<p>But, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is struck <em>down</em> by unbelief,</p>

<p class="indent">Lost is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and life has perished from the man.</p>

<p>Shamuna and Guria of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as men </p>

<p class="indent">Were heedful, that it should not be struck <em>down</em> by persecutors:</p>

<p>For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that, if <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is preserved,</p>

<p class="indent">Both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body are preserved from destruction.</p>

<p>And, because of this, touching their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> were they solicitous,</p>

<p class="indent">That that should not be struck <em>down</em> in which their very life was hidden.</p>

<p>They gave up their bodies both to blows and to dislocation, </p>

<p class="indent">Yea to every <em>kind of</em> torture, that their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should not be stricken <em>down;</em></p>

<p>And, even as the serpent also hides his head from blows,</p>

<p class="indent">So hid they their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> within their hearts;</p>

<p>And the body was smitten, and endured stripes, and bore sufferings:</p>

<p class="indent">But overthrown was not their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was within their hearts.</p>

<p>The mouth betrays the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to death when it speaks,</p>

<p class="indent">And with the tongue, as with a sword, works slaughter.</p>

<p>And from it spring up both life and death to men:</p>

<p class="indent">Denying <em>a man</em> dies, confessing he lives, and <em>the mouth</em> has power over it.</p>

<p>Denial is death, and in confession is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> life;</p>

<p class="indent">And power has the mouth over them both, like a judge.</p>

<p>The word of the mouth opens the door for death to enter in;</p>

<p class="indent">This, too, calls for life, and it beams forth upon the man.</p>

<p>Even the robber by one word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></p>

<p class="indent">Won him the kingdom, and became heir of paradise,  all fraught with blessings.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> judges too, from the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the sons of the right hand,</p>

<p class="indent">Demanded that by word of mouth only they should <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>;</p>

<p>But, like <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> men holding fast the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">They uttered not a word by which unbelief might be served.</p>

<p>Shamuna, beauty of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who is adequate to <em>tell of</em> you?</p>

<p class="indent">All too narrow is my mouth for your praise, too mean for you to be spoken of by it.</p>

<p>Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is your beauty, your crown your suffering, your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> your stripes,</p>

<p class="indent">And by reason of your blows magnificent is the beauty of your championship.</p>

<p>Proud of you is our country, as of a treasury which is full of gold:</p>

<p>Since <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> are you to us, and a <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> store which cannot be stolen <em>from us</em>.</p>

<p>Guria, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, staunch hero of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">Who shall suffice you, to recount your beauties divine?</p>

<p>Lo! Tortures on your body are set like gems of beryl,</p>

<p class="indent">And the sword on your neck like a chain of choice gold.</p>

<p>Your blood upon your form is a robe of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> full of beauty,</p>

<p class="indent">And the scourging of your back a vesture with which the sun may not compare.</p>

<p>Radiant you are and comely by virtue of these your sufferings, so abounding;</p>

<p class="indent">And resplendent are your beauties, because of the pains which are <em>so</em> severe upon you.</p>

<p>Shamuna, our riches, richer are you than the rich:</p>

<p class="indent">For lo! The rich stand at your door, that you may relieve them.</p>

<p>Small your village, poor your country: who, then, gave you</p>

<p class="indent">That lords of villages and cities should court your favour?</p>

<p>Lo! judges in their robes and vestments</p>

<p class="indent">Take dust from your threshold, as <em>though it were</em> the medicine of life.</p>

<p>The cross is rich, and to its worshippers increases riches;</p>

<p class="indent">And its poverty despises all the riches of the world.</p>

<p>Shamuna and Guria, sons of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, lo! At your doors</p>

<p class="indent">Bow down the rich, that they may receive from you <em>supplies for</em> their wants.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> in poverty and want</p>

<p class="indent">Showed to the world that all its riches are as nothing,</p>

<p> <em>His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a></em>, all fishermen, all poor, all weak,</p>

<p class="indent">All men of little note, became illustrious through His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>One fisherman, whose <q>village</q> too was a home of fishermen, </p>

<p class="indent">He made chief over the twelve, yea head of the house. </p>

<p>One a tentmaker, who aforetime was a persecutor,</p>

<p class="indent">He seized upon, and made him a chosen vessel for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Shamuna and Guria came from villages that were not <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">And lo! In a great city became they lords;</p>

<p>And its chief men, its judges also, stand before their doors,</p>

<p class="indent">And they solicit their charity to satisfy their wants.</p>

<p>From their confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a></p>

<p class="indent">These blessed men acquired riches beyond compute.</p>

<p>Poor did He Himself become, and the poor made He rich;</p>

<p class="indent">And lo! enriched is the whole creation through His poverty.</p>

<p>The chosen <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> did battle against <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">And in the confession of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> stood they firm like valiant men.</p>

<p>They went in and confessed Him before the judge with look undaunted, </p>

<p class="indent">That He too might confess them, even as they confessed Him, before His Father.</p>

<p>There arose against them the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> like a tempest;</p>

<p class="indent">But the cross was their helmsman, and steered them on.</p>

<p>They were required to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to lifeless images,</p>

<p class="indent">But they departed not from their confession of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>The wind of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> blew in their faces,</p>

<p class="indent">But they themselves were as rocks piled up against the hurricane.</p>

<p>Like a swift whirlwind, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> snatched at them;</p>

<p class="indent">But, forasmuch as they were sheltered by the crucifixion, it hurt them not.</p>

<p>The Evil One set on all his dogs to bark, that they might bite them;</p>

<p>But, forasmuch as they had the cross for a staff, they put them all to flight.</p>

<p>But who is sufficient to tell of their contests,</p>

<p class="indent">Or their sufferings, or the rending asunder of their limbs?</p>

<p>Or who can paint the picture of their coronation, </p>

<p class="indent">How they went up from the contest covered with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>?</p>

<p>To judgment they went in, but of the judge they took no account;</p>

<p class="indent">Nor were they anxious what they should say when questioned.</p>

<p>The judge menaced <em>them</em>, and multiplied his words of threatening;</p>

<p class="indent">And recounted tortures and all <em>kinds of</em> inflictions, that he might terrify them.</p>

<p>He spoke great words,  that by fright and intimidation,</p>

<p class="indent">By menaces too, he might incline them to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<p>Yet the combatants despised the menaces, and the intimidations,</p>

<p class="indent">And the sentence of judgment, and all bodily deaths;</p>

<p>And they prepared themselves for insult and stripes, and for blows,</p>

<p class="indent">And for provocation, and to be dragged along, and to be burnt;</p>

<p>For imprisonment also, and for bonds, and for all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things,</p>

<p class="indent">And for all tortures, and for all sufferings, rejoicing all the while.</p>

<p>They were not alarmed nor affrighted, nor dismayed,</p>

<p class="indent">Nor did the sharpness of the tortures bend them to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<p>Their body they despised, and as dung upon the ground accounted they it:</p>

<p class="indent">For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that, the more it was beaten, the more would its beauty increase;</p>

<p>And, the more the judge increased his menaces to alarm them,</p>

<p class="indent">The more did they show their contempt of him, having no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of his threats.</p>

<p>He kept telling them what tortures he had prepared for them;</p>

<p class="indent">And they continued telling him about Gehenna which was reserved for him.</p>

<p>By those things which he told <em>them</em> he tried to frighten them to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">And they spoke to him about the fearful judgment yonder.</p>

<p>Truth is wiser than wise words,</p>

<p class="indent">And very hateful, however much it may be adorned, is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<p>Shamuna and Guria went on speaking <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">While the judge continued to utter <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<p>And therefore were they not afraid of his threatening,</p>

<p class="indent">Because all his menaces against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were accounted <em>by them</em> as empty sound. </p>

<p>The intercourse of the world they despised, they contemned and scorned, <em>yea</em> they abandoned;</p>

<p class="indent">And to return to it they had no wish, or to enter it <em>again</em>.</p>

<p>From the place of judgment they set their faces to depart</p>

<p class="indent">To that meeting-place for them all, the life of the new world.</p>

<p>They cared neither for possessions nor for houses,</p>

<p class="indent">Nor for the advantages of this world, so full of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>In the world of light was their heart bound captive with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">And to <q>that</q> country did they set their face to depart;</p>

<p>And they looked to the sword, to come and be a bridge</p>

<p class="indent">To let them pass over to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for whom they were longing.</p>

<p>This world they accounted as a little tent,</p>

<p class="indent">But that yonder as a city full of beauties;</p>

<p>And they were in haste by the sword to depart hence</p>

<p class="indent">To the land of light, which is full of blessing for those who are worthy of it.</p>

<p>The judge commanded to hang them up by their arms,</p>

<p class="indent">And without mercy did they stretch them out in bitter agony.</p>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon's</a> fury breathed rage into the heart of the judge,</p>

<p class="indent">And embittered him against the steadfast ones, <em>inciting him</em> to crush them;</p>

<p>And between the height and the depth he stretched them out to afflict them:</p>

<p class="indent">And they were a marvel to both sides, <em>when they saw</em> how much they endured.</p>

<p>At the old men's frame heaven and earth marvelled,</p>

<p class="indent"> <em>To see</em> how much suffering it bore nor cried out for help under <em>their</em> affliction.</p>

<p>Hung up and dragged along are their feeble bodies by their arms,</p>

<p class="indent">Yet is there deep silence, nor is there one that cries out for help or that murmurs.</p>

<p>Amazed were all who beheld their contests,</p>

<p class="indent"> <em>To see</em> how <em>calmly</em> the outstretched forms bore the inflictions <em>laid upon them</em>. </p>

<p>Amazed too was <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> at their spotless frames,</p>

<p class="indent"> <em>To see</em> what weight of affliction they sustained without a groan.</p>

<p>Yea, and gladdened too were the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> by that <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> <em>of theirs</em>,</p>

<p class="indent"> <em>To see</em> how patiently it bore that contest so terrible that was.</p>

<p>But, as combatants who were awaiting their crowns,</p>

<p class="indent">There entered no sense of weariness into their minds.</p>

<p>Nay, it was the judge that grew weary; yea, he was astonished:</p>

<p class="indent">But the noble men <em>before him felt</em> no weariness in their afflictions.</p>

<p>He asked them whether they would consent to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">But the mouth was unable to speak from pain.</p>

<p>Thus did the persecutors increase their inflictions,</p>

<p class="indent">Until they gave no place for the word to be spoken.</p>

<p>Silent was the mouth from the inflictions laid on their limbs;</p>

<p class="indent">But the will, like that of a hero, was nerved with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> from itself.</p>

<p>Alas for the persecutors! How destitute were they of righteousness!</p>

<p class="indent">But the children of light&mdash; how were they clad in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>!</p>

<p>They demand speech, when there is no place for speaking,</p>

<p class="indent">Since the word of the mouth was forbidden them by pain.</p>

<p>Fast bound was the body, and silent the mouth, and it was unable</p>

<p class="indent">To utter the word when unrighteously questioned.</p>

<p>And what should the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> do, who had no power to say,</p>

<p class="indent">When he was questioned, that he would not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>?</p>

<p>All silent were the old men full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">And from pain they were incapable of speaking.</p>

<p>Yet questioned they were: and in what way, if a man is silent</p>

<p class="indent">When he is questioned, shall he assent to that which is said?</p>

<p>But the old men, that they might not be thought to assent,</p>

<p class="indent">Expressed clearly by signs the word which it behooved them to speak.</p>

<p>Their heads they shook, and, instead of speech, by a dumb sign they showed</p>

<p class="indent">The resolve of the new man that was within.</p>

<p>Their heads hung down, signifying amidst their pains</p>

<p class="indent">That they were not going to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and every one understood their meaning.</p>

<p>As long as there was in them place for speech, with speech did they confess;</p>

<p class="indent">But, when it was forbidden them by pain, they spoke with a dumb sign.</p>

<p>Of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they spoke both with the voice and without the voice:</p>

<p class="indent">So that, when speaking and also when silent, they were <em>alike</em> steadfast.</p>

<p>Who but must be amazed at the path of life, how narrow it is,</p>

<p class="indent">And how straight to him that desires to walk in it?</p>

<p>Who but must marvel <em>to see</em> that, when the will is watchful and ready,</p>

<p class="indent">It is very broad and full of light to him that goes therein?</p>

<p>About the path are ditches; full also is it of pitfalls;</p>

<p class="indent">And, if one turn but a little aside from it, a ditch receives him.</p>

<p>That dumb sign only is there between the right and the left,</p>

<p class="indent">And on <q>Yea</q> and <q>Nay</q> stand  <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and righteousness.</p>

<p>By a dumb sign only did the blessed men plainly signify that they would not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">And in virtue of a single dumb sign did the path lead them to <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>;</p>

<p>And, if this same dumb sign had inclined and turned down but a little</p>

<p class="indent">Toward the depth, the path of the old men would have been to Gehenna.</p>

<p>Upwards they made a sign, <em>to signify</em> that upwards were they prepared to ascend;</p>

<p class="indent">And in consequence of that sign they ascended and mingled with the heavenly ones.</p>

<p>Between sign and sign were Paradise and Gehenna:</p>

<p class="indent">They made a sign that they would not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, and they inherited the place of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Even while they were silent they were advocates for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>:</p>

<p class="indent">For not in multitude of words does <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> consist.</p>

<p>That <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of theirs was a full-voiced confession,</p>

<p class="indent">And as though with open mouth declared they <em>their</em> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by signs;</p>

<p>And every one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what they were saying, though silent,</p>

<p class="indent">And enriched and increased was the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was put to shame by reason of two old men, who, though they spoke not,</p>

<p class="indent">Vanquished it; and they kept silence, and their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> stood fast.</p>

<p>And, though tempestuous accents were heard from the judge,</p>

<p class="indent">And the commands of the emperor were dreadful, yea violent,</p>

<p>And paganism had a bold face and an open mouth,</p>

<p class="indent">And its voice was raised, and silent were the old men with pain,</p>

<p> <em>Yet</em> null and void became the command and drowned was the voice of the judge,</p>

<p class="indent">And without speech the mute sign of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> bore off the palm.</p>

<p>Talking and clamour, and the sound of stripes, on the left;</p>

<p class="indent">And deep silence and suffering standing on the right;</p>

<p>And, by one mute sign with which the old men pointed above their heads,</p>

<p class="indent">The head of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was lifted up, and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was put to shame.</p>

<p>Worsted in the encounter were they who spoke, and the victory was to the silent:</p>

<p class="indent">For, voiceless they uttered by signs the discourse of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>They took them down, because they had vanquished while silent;</p>

<p class="indent">And they put them in bonds, threatening <em>yet</em> to vanquish them.</p>

<p>Bonds and a dungeon void of light were by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a></p>

<p class="indent">Held of no account&mdash; yea <em>rather</em> as the light which has no end.</p>

<p> <em>To be</em> without bread, and without water, and without light,</p>

<p class="indent">Pleased them well, because of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>The judge commanded by their feet to hang them up</p>

<p class="indent">With their heads downwards, by a sentence all unrighteous:</p>

<p>Hanged up was Shamuna with his head downwards; and he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a></p>

<p class="indent"> <em>In</em> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> pure and strained clear by pain.</p>

<p>Sweet fruit was hanging on the tree in that judgment-hall,</p>

<p class="indent">And its taste and smell made the very denizens of heaven to marvel.</p>

<p>Afflicted was his body, but sound was his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">Bound fast was his person, but unfettered was his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> over his deed.</p>

<p>For, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> nothing whatsoever turns aside,</p>

<p class="indent">And <em>nothing</em> hinders it&mdash; not even sword, not even fire.</p>

<p>His form was turned upside down, but <em>his</em> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was unrestrained,</p>

<p class="indent">And straight was its path on high to the abode of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>The more the affliction of the chosen <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was increased,</p>

<p class="indent">The more from his lips was all confession heard.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> longed for the whetted sword affectionately,</p>

<p class="indent">And sought it as a treasure full of riches.</p>

<p>A new work has the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> wrought in the world&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent">That dreadful death should be yearned for  by many.</p>

<p>That men should run to meet the sword is a thing unheard of,</p>

<p class="indent">Except they were those whom Jesus has enlisted in His service by His crucifixion.</p>

<p>That death is bitter, every one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> lo! From earliest time:</p>

<p class="indent">To <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> alone is it not bitter to be slain.</p>

<p>They laughed at the whetted sword when they saw it,</p>

<p class="indent">And greeted it with smiles: for it was that which was the occasion of their crowns.</p>

<p>As though it had been something <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a>, they left the body to be beaten:</p>

<p class="indent">Even though loving it, they held it not back from pains.</p>

<p>For the sword they waited, and the sword went forth and crowned them:</p>

<p class="indent">Because for it they looked; and it came to meet them, even as they desired.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> slew death by His crucifixion;</p>

<p class="indent">And, inasmuch as death is slain, it caused no suffering to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</p>

<p>With a wounded serpent one plays without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">A slain lion even a coward will drag along:</p>

<p>The great serpent our Lord crushed by His crucifixion;</p>

<p class="indent">The dread lion did the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> slay by His sufferings.</p>

<p>Death bound He fast, and laid him prostrate and trampled on him at the gate of Hades;</p>

<p class="indent">And <em>now</em> whosoever will draws near and mocks at him, because he is slain.</p>

<p>These old men, Shamuna and Guria, mocked at death,</p>

<p class="indent">As at that lion which by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was slain.</p>

<p>The great serpent, which slew <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> among the trees,</p>

<p class="indent"> <em>Who</em> could seize, so long as he drank not of the blood of the cross?</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> crushed the dragon by His crucifixion,</p>

<p class="indent">And lo! Boys and old men mock the wounded serpent.</p>

<p>Pierced is the lion with the spear which <em>pierced</em> the side of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">And whosoever will tramples on him, yea mocks at him.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; He is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things,</p>

<p class="indent">And Him does it behoove every mouth to celebrate.</p>

<p>He did Himself espouse  the bride with the blood which flowed from His wounds,</p>

<p class="indent">And of His wedding-friends He demanded as a nuptial gift  the blood of their necks.</p>

<p>The Lord of the wedding-feast hung on the cross in nakedness,</p>

<p class="indent">And whosoever came to be a guest, He let fall His blood upon him.</p>

<p>Shamuna and Guria gave up their bodies for His sake</p>

<p class="indent">To sufferings and tomes and to all the various forms of woe. </p>

<p>At Him they looked as He was mocked by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men,</p>

<p class="indent">And thus did they themselves endure mockery without a groan.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> was enriched by your slaughter, O blessed ones:</p>

<p class="indent">For you adorned her with your crowns and with your sufferings.</p>

<p>Her beauty are you, her bulwark ye, her <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> ye,</p>

<p class="indent">Her riches and her store, yea her boast and all her treasure.</p>

<p>Faithful stewards are you: </p>

<p class="indent">Since by your sufferings ye did array the bride in beauty.</p>

<p>The daughter of the Parthians, who was espoused to the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, </p>

<p class="indent">Of <em>you</em> makes her boast: since by your teaching lo! she was enlightened.</p>

<p>Her advocates are you; <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> who, though silent, vanquished</p>

<p class="indent">All <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, while its voice was uplifted high in unbelief.</p>

<p>Those old men  of the daughter of the Hebrews were sons of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>, </p>

<p class="indent">False witnesses, who killed Naboth, feigning themselves <em>to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a></em>.</p>

<p>Her did <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> outdo by her two old men full of beauty,</p>

<p class="indent">Who were witnesses to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and died like Naboth.</p>

<p>Two were there, and two here, old men;</p>

<p class="indent">And these were called witnesses, and witnesses those.</p>

<p>Let us now see which of them were witnesses chosen of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">And which city is beloved by reason of her old men and of her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> ones.</p>

<p>Lo! The sons of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> who slew Naboth are witnesses;</p>

<p class="indent">And here Shamuna and Guria, again, are witnesses.</p>

<p>Let us now see which witnesses, and which old men,</p>

<p class="indent">And which city can stand with confidence  before God.</p>

<p>Sons of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a> were those witnesses of that adulterous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">And lo! Their shame is all portrayed in their names.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa's</a> just and righteous old men, her witnesses,</p>

<p class="indent">Were like Naboth, who himself also was slain for righteousness' sake.</p>

<p>They were not like the two lying sons of <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">Nor is <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> like Zion, which also crucified <em>the Lord</em>.</p>

<p>Like herself her old men were false, yea dared</p>

<p class="indent">To shed on the ground innocent blood wickedly.</p>

<p> <em>But</em> by these witnesses here lo! The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is spoken.&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent">Blessed be He who gave us the treasure-store of their crowns!</p>

<p> <em>Here</em> ends the Homily on Guria and Shamuna.</p>
