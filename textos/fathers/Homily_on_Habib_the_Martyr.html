<h1>Homily on Habib the Martyr</h1>

<p> <em>Homily on Habib the Martyr, Composed by Mar Jacob. </em></p>

<p>Habib the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, clad in flame, has called to me out of the fire,</p>

<p class="indent">That for him likewise I should fashion an image of beauty among the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</p>

<p>Comrade of conquerors, lo! He beckons to me out of the burning,</p>

<p class="indent">That, as for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of his Lord, I should sing concerning him.</p>

<p>In the midst of live coals stands the <em>heroic</em> man, and lo! He calls to me,</p>

<p class="indent">That I should fashion his image: but the blazing fire permits me not.</p>

<p>His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is fervid, glowing is his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">His fire also burns, and who is adequate to recount his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>?</p>

<p>Nay, by reason of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which led the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> into the fire,</p>

<p class="indent">No man is able to recount his beauties divine.</p>

<p>For who shall dare enter and see in the blazing fire</p>

<p>To whom he is like, and after what pattern he is to be fashioned among the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>?</p>

<p>Shall I fashion his image by the side of the youths, the children of the furnace?</p>

<p class="indent">With Hananiah shall I reckon Habib? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.</p>

<p>Lo! These were not burned there: how, then, is he like?</p>

<p class="indent">He, <em>I say</em>, like them, when he was burned and the youths not?</p>

<p>Which, I ask, <em>the more</em> beautiful&mdash; Habib the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, or Azariah?</p>

<p class="indent">Difficult for me is the image: how I am to look upon it, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not.</p>

<p>Lo! Michael was not burned by the flame;</p>

<p class="indent">But Habib was burned: which, then, <em>the more</em> beautiful to him that looks upon him?</p>

<p>Who shall dare say that this is repulsive, or that;</p>

<p class="indent">Or not so comely this as that, to him that beholds him?</p>

<p>Three <em>there are</em> in the fire, and the flame comes not near them;</p>

<p class="indent">But one was burned: and how shall I suffice to tell</p>

<p>That the Fourth <em>form</em> is that of Him who went down into the midst of the furnace,</p>

<p class="indent">That He might fashion an image for Habib there along with <em>those of</em> the three?</p>

<p>He gives a place in the fire to him who was burned,</p>

<p class="indent">That he may be, instead of Him the Fourth, by the side of the conquerors.</p>

<p>And, if of the three the beauties be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, though they were not burned,</p>

<p class="indent">How shall not this one, who <em>was</em> burned, be mingled with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>?</p>

<p>If a man have the power either to be burned or not to be burned,</p>

<p class="indent">Of this man, who was burned, more exalted was the beauty than that of the three.</p>

<p>But, inasmuch as the Lord is the control <em>of all things</em>,</p>

<p class="indent"> <em>He</em> is to be praised, <em>both</em> where He rescues and where He delivers up.</p>

<p>Moreover, too, the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the three who were not burned,</p>

<p class="indent">And of him who was burned, is one and the same, in this case and in that; </p>

<p>And, had its Lord commanded the fire to burn them,</p>

<p class="indent"> <em>Even</em> those three on their part, burned they would have been;</p>

<p>And, if He had signified to it that it should not burn that one man also,</p>

<p class="indent">He would not have been burned; nor had it been of himself that he was rescued.</p>

<p>To go into the fire was of their own will, when they went in;</p>

<p class="indent">But that they were not burned&mdash; <em>because</em> the Lord of the fire willed and commanded it.</p>

<p>Therefore one equal beauty is that of him who was burned,</p>

<p class="indent">And that of him who was not burned, because the will also was equal.</p>

<p>Beloved <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>! exalted is your beauty; exalted is your rank:</p>

<p class="indent">Graceful too your crown, and mingled your story with <em>that of</em> the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</p>

<p>Choice gold are you, and the fire has tried you, and resplendent is your beauty.</p>

<p class="indent">And lo! Into the King's crown are you wrought, along with the victorious.</p>

<p>Good workman! Who, in the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">Pursues his course like a valiant  man, because of the beauty of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Habib the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was a teacher of that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">A preacher also, whose mouth was full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Watchful was he, and prompt <em>for service;</em> and he encouraged with his teaching</p>

<p class="indent">The household of the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Of light was he full, and he wrestled with the darkness</p>

<p class="indent">Which overspread the country from the paganism which had darkened it.</p>

<p>With the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of the Son was his mouth filled in the congregations;</p>

<p class="indent">And as it were a leader of the way did he become to the villages when he arrived in them.</p>

<p>Zealous he was, because he was concerned for the doctrine</p>

<p class="indent">Divine, that he might establish the adherents  of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>At the time when the winds of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> blew, a lamp was he,</p>

<p class="indent">And flamed forth while they blew upon him, and went not out.</p>

<p>All on fire was he, and filled with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his Lord, and was concerned</p>

<p class="indent">For this&mdash; that he might speak of Him without hindrance. </p>

<p>The thorns of errour sprang up in the land from paganism;</p>

<p class="indent">And, as much as in him lay, he rooted them out by his diligence.</p>

<p>He taught, admonished, and confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">The friends of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  who were harassed by persecutors.</p>

<p>Against sword and against fire did he wrestle,</p>

<p class="indent">With <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> hot as the flame, and was not afraid.</p>

<p>Like a two-edged brand,  keen was</p>

<p class="indent">His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and against <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> did he contend.</p>

<p>Leaven did he prove to be in this land which had become exhausted </p>

<p class="indent">Through fondness for the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of vanity which <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> had brought in.</p>

<p>He was like <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> by reason of his savoury doctrine</p>

<p class="indent">To this region, which had become insipid through unbelief.</p>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> was he, and filled the place of a high-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a></p>

<p class="indent">By the preaching and teaching of that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>

<p>He was to the flock a good shepherd while he was <em>its</em> overseer;</p>

<p class="indent">And his life laid he down for the flock while he tended it.</p>

<p>He chased away the wolf, and drove off from it the beast of prey.</p>

<p class="indent">And he repaired the breaches, and gathered the lambs into their folds.</p>

<p>He went out secretly <em>and</em> encouraged the congregations:</p>

<p class="indent">He strengthened them, and exhorted them, and held them up.</p>

<p>And he forged armour of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and put it on them,</p>

<p class="indent">That they might not be ignominiously overthrown  by the paganism which abounded.</p>

<p>The flocks of the fold of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> were being laid waste</p>

<p class="indent">By persecutors: and he encouraged the lambs and the ewes.</p>

<p>And he was an advocate to the household of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">And he taught them not to be daunted by persecutors.</p>

<p>He taught them to run to meet death,</p>

<p class="indent">Without being afraid either of sword or of fire.</p>

<p>In the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> he prospered,</p>

<p class="indent">So that his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> pursued its course without dread.</p>

<p>Then errour grew <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, became <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a>, and was maddened, because of him;</p>

<p class="indent">And she pursued after him, that she might shed upon the earth innocent blood.</p>

<p>The Defamer, who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">Laid snares for him, that he might rid the place of his presence. </p>

<p>He who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> pursued after him to put him to death,</p>

<p class="indent">That he might make his voice to cease  from the teaching of the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>And errour raised an outcry <em>demanding</em> that Habib should die, because she <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him;</p>

<p class="indent">Vexation goaded her on, and she sought to take away his life.</p>

<p>His story was talked about  before the pagan judge of the country,</p>

<p class="indent">And the dear fame of him reached the king: who in great rage,</p>

<p>And because the diadem was interwoven with paganism, decreed  death</p>

<p class="indent">Against Habib, because he was full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>And, when the command reached the judge, he armed himself</p>

<p class="indent">With rage and fury; and, with a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> thirsting for blood,</p>

<p>And like hunters who lay nets for the young stag,</p>

<p class="indent">After Habib did they go out to catch <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>But this man was a preacher of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">Who in the highway of the crucifixion was prospering;</p>

<p>And, that he might benefit by his teaching the children of his people,</p>

<p class="indent">His work embraced the countries round about him.</p>

<p>So, when <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> went out after him, she found him not:</p>

<p class="indent">Not that he was fled, but that he had gone out to preach the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>Then, because of the fury of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, which was great beyond all that was meet,</p>

<p class="indent">His kindred and his mother did they seize for his sake.</p>

<p>Blessed are you, O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>! Mother since you are of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">For wherefore was it that they seized you <em>and</em> bound you, iniquitously?</p>

<p>What do they require of you, O you full of beauty? What, <em>I ask</em>, have they required of you?</p>

<p class="indent">Lo! They require of you that you bring the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, that he may be a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.</p>

<p>Bring, oh bring your sweet fruit to the place of the oblation&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent"> <em>The fruit</em> whose smell is fragrant, that it may be <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to the Godhead.</p>

<p>Fair shoot, your cluster bring from where it is,</p>

<p class="indent">That its wine may be for a libation whose taste is sweet.</p>

<p>The lamb heard that they were seeking him, that he might be a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">And he set out and came to the sacrificers rejoicing.</p>

<p>He heard that others also were being afflicted for his sake,</p>

<p class="indent">And he came that he might bear the suffering which was his, in the stead of many.</p>

<p>The lot fell on him, to be himself alone a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">And the fire that was to offer him up was looking out <em>for him</em> until he came.</p>

<p>Of the many who were bound for his sake</p>

<p class="indent">Not one single person was seized to die, but only he.</p>

<p>He it was that was worthy, and for him was <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> reserved;</p>

<p class="indent">And to snatch the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> place no man was able.</p>

<p>And therefore of his own will did he present himself</p>

<p class="indent">To the judge, that he might be seized, and die for Jesus' sake.</p>

<p>He heard that they sought him, and he came that he might be seized, even as they sought him:</p>

<p class="indent">And he went in of himself before the judge, and dauntless was his look.</p>

<p>He hid not himself, nor did he wish to flee from the judge:</p>

<p class="indent">For with light was he imbued, and from the darkness he would not flee.</p>

<p>No robber <em>was he</em>, no murderer, no thief,</p>

<p class="indent">No child of night: but all his course was run in open day.</p>

<p>Wherefore from his flock should the good shepherd flee,</p>

<p class="indent">And leave his fold to be devoured by <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>?</p>

<p>Wherefore should the physician flee, who goes forth to heal diseases,</p>

<p class="indent">And to cure <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> by the blood of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</p>

<p>A fearless countenance  did the <em>brave</em> man carry with him, and a great heart;</p>

<p class="indent">And to meet death he ran, rejoicing, for Jesus' sake.</p>

<p>He went in, he stood before the judge, saying to him:</p>

<p class="indent">I am Habib, whom you sought: lo! <em>here</em> I stand.</p>

<p>And the pagan trembled, and amazement seized him, and he marvelled at him&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent">At the man who was not afraid, either of sword or of fire.</p>

<p>While he thought that he was fleeing apace, he entered in and mocked him;</p>

<p class="indent">And the judge shook, for he saw him courageous in the <em>very</em> face of death.</p>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> he of that <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who said:</p>

<p class="indent"><q>Rise, come, let us go: for he that betrays me lo! Is here.</q></p>

<p>And to the crucifiers, again, He said: <q>Whom do you seek?</q></p>

<p class="indent">They say: <q>Jesus.</q> And He said to them: <q>I am He.</q></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> of His own will came to the cross;</p>

<p class="indent">And on Him the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> looked, and presented himself <em>uncompelled</em> before the judge.</p>

<p>And the pagan beheld him, and was smitten with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and was exasperated <em>against him</em>.</p>

<p class="indent">His rage was excited, and he began in his fury to put to him questions. </p>

<p>And, as if he had been one who had shed on the ground the blood of the slain,</p>

<p class="indent">He proceeded to question the saintly man, but he was not ashamed:</p>

<p>Menacing him, and trying to terrify him, and to frighten him,</p>

<p class="indent">And recounting the sufferings which were being prepared by him on his account.</p>

<p>But Habib, when questioned, was not afraid,</p>

<p class="indent">Was not ashamed, and was not frightened by the menaces <em>he heard</em>.</p>

<p>Lifting up his voice, he confessed Jesus, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent">That he was His servant, and was His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and His minister. </p>

<p>At the fury of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, roaring at him like lions,</p>

<p class="indent">He trembled not, nor ceased  from the confession of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>He was scourged, and the scourgings were very dear to him,</p>

<p class="indent">Seeing that he bore a little of the stripes of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>He was put into bonds,  and he looked on his Lord, whom also they had bound;</p>

<p class="indent">And his heart rejoiced that in the path of His sufferings he had begun to walk.</p>

<p>He ascended the block,  and they tore him with combs, but his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was radiant with light,</p>

<p class="indent">Because he was <em>deemed</em> worthy that on him should come the agony of the sufferings of crucifixion.</p>

<p>In the pathway of death had he set his face to walk,</p>

<p class="indent">And what could he desire to find in it but sufferings?</p>

<p>The fire of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>  was <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to him, and for her did he look;</p>

<p class="indent">And she <em>on her part</em> sent him combs, and stripes, and pains, to taste.</p>

<p>All the while that she was coming, she sent him sufferings, that by means of them</p>

<p class="indent">He might be prepared, so that when she met him she might not dismay him.</p>

<p>Sufferings purged him, so that, when the blazing fire should put him to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">There might not be any dross <em>found</em> in his choice gold.</p>

<p>And he endured the whole of the pains that came upon him,</p>

<p class="indent">That he might have experience <em>of suffering</em>, and in the burning stand like a brave man.</p>

<p>And he accepted rejoicing the sufferings which he had to bear:</p>

<p class="indent">For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that at their termination he should find death.</p>

<p>And he was not afraid, either of death or of sufferings:</p>

<p class="indent">For with that wine of the crucifixion his heart was drunk.</p>

<p>He despised his body, while it was being dragged along by the persecutors;</p>

<p class="indent">And his limbs, while they were being torn asunder in bitter agony. </p>

<p>Scourges on his back, combs on his sides, stocks on his feet,</p>

<p class="indent">And fire in front of him: still was he brave and full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>They taunted him: Lo! You worship a man;</p>

<p class="indent">But he said: A man I worship not,</p>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who took a body and became man:</p>

<p class="indent">Him do I worship, because He is God with Him that begot Him.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Habib, the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, was full of light</p>

<p class="indent">And by it was enlightened <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, the faithful <em>city</em>.</p>

<p>The daughter of <a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a>, whom Add&aelig;us <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to the crucifixion&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent">Through it is her light, through it her <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Her king is from it, her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> from it, her <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from it;</p>

<p class="indent">The teachers also of <em>her</em> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are from it.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01042c.htm">Abgar</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that You are <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">And he received a blessing because of the beauty of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Sharbil the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, son of the Edess&aelig;ans, more-ever said:</p>

<p class="indent">My heart is led captive by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who became man.</p>

<p>And Habib the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who also was crowned at <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">Confessed these things: that He took a body and became man;</p>

<p>That He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and also is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and became man.</p>

<p class="indent"><a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> learned from teachers the things that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>:</p>

<p>Her king taught her, her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> taught her, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">But to others, who were fraudulent teachers, she would not hearken.</p>

<p>Habib the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, in the ear of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>, thus cried aloud</p>

<p class="indent">Out of the midst of the fire: A man I worship not,</p>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who took a body and became man</p>

<p class="indent">Him do I worship. <em>Thus</em> confessed the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> with uplifted voice.</p>

<p>From confessors torn with combs, burnt, raised up <em>on the block</em>, slain</p>

<p class="indent">And <em>from</em> a righteous king, did <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> learn the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</p>

<p>And she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> our Lord&mdash; that He is even <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">She also learned and firmly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He took a body and became man.</p>

<p>Not from common <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> did she learn the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>:</p>

<p class="indent">Her king taught her, her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> taught her; and she firmly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> them:</p>

<p>And, if she be <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> as having ever worshipped a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">She points to her <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who died for Him as being God.</p>

<p>A man I worship not, said Habib,</p>

<p class="indent">Because it is written: <q>Cursed is he that puts his trust in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> </p>

<p>Forasmuch as He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I worship Him, yea submit to be burned</p>

<p class="indent">For His sake, nor will I renounce His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> held fast from her youth,</p>

<p class="indent">And in her old age she will not barter it away as a daughter of the poor.</p>

<p>Her righteous king became to her a scribe, and from him she learned</p>

<p class="indent">Concerning our Lord&mdash; that He is the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, yea God.</p>

<p>Add&aelig;us, who brought the bridegroom's ring and put it on her hand,</p>

<p class="indent">Betrothed her thus to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, who is the Only- <em>begotten</em>.</p>

<p>Sharbil the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who made trial and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of all gods,</p>

<p class="indent">Died, even as he said, <q>for God who became man.</q></p>

<p>Shamuna and Guria, for the sake of the Only- <em>begotten</em>,</p>

<p class="indent">Stretched out their necks <em>to receive the stroke</em>, and for Him died, forasmuch as He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>And Habib the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, who was teacher of congregations,</p>

<p class="indent">Preached of Him, that He took a body and became man.</p>

<p>For a man the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> would not have <em>submitted to be</em> burned in the fire;</p>

<p class="indent">But he was burned <q>for the sake of God who became man.</q></p>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that thus he confessed while he was being burned:</p>

<p class="indent">And from the confession of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> that has been burned who is he that can escape?</p>

<p>All minds does <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> reduce to silence and despise&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent"> <em>She</em> that is full of light and stoops not to shadows.</p>

<p>She despises him that maligns the Son by denying that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">Him too that says <q>He took not a body and became man.</q></p>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was full of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he stood upon the fire;</p>

<p class="indent">And he became <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and propitiated with his fragrance the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</p>

<p>In all <em>his</em> afflictions, and in all <em>his</em> tortures, and in all <em>his</em> sufferings,</p>

<p class="indent">Thus did he confess, and thus did he teach the blessed <em>city</em>.</p>

<p>And this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> did <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a> hold fast touching our Lord&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent">Even that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and of Mary became a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</p>

<p>And the bride <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> him that denies His God-head,</p>

<p class="indent">And despises and contemns him that maligns His corporeal nature.</p>

<p>And she recognises Him <em>as</em> One in Godhead and in manhood&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent">The Only- <em>begotten</em>, whose body is inseparable from Him.</p>

<p>And thus did the daughter of the Parthians learn to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">And thus did she firmly hold, and thus does she teach him that listens to her.</p>

<p>The judge, therefore, full of <em><a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for</em> paganism, commanded</p>

<p class="indent">That the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> should be led forth and burned in the fire which was reserved for him.</p>

<p>And immediately a strap was thrust into his mouth, as <em>though he had been</em> a murderer,</p>

<p class="indent">His confession being kept within his heart towards God.</p>

<p>And they hurried him away, and he went out from the judgment-hall, rejoicing</p>

<p class="indent">That the hour had come when the crown should be given to his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>And there went out with him crowds of people, that they might bear him company,</p>

<p class="indent">Looking upon him, not as a dead man accompanied <em>to his burial</em>,</p>

<p>But as a man who was going away that by means of fire he might become a bridegroom,</p>

<p class="indent">And that there might be bestowed the crown which was by righteousness reserved for him.</p>

<p>They looked upon him as upon a man entering into battle,</p>

<p class="indent">And around him were spears, and lances, and swords, but he vanquished them.</p>

<p>They beheld him going up like a champion from the contest,</p>

<p class="indent">And in his triumph chaplets were brought to him by those who beheld.</p>

<p>They looked upon him as he vanquished principalities and powers,</p>

<p class="indent">Which all made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with him, and he put them to shame.</p>

<p>The whole congregation of the followers of Christ exulted over him,</p>

<p class="indent">Because he raised up the friends  of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by the sufferings which he bore.</p>

<p>There went forth with him the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a bride full of light;</p>

<p class="indent">And her face was beaming on the beloved <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> who was united to her.</p>

<p>Then did his mother, because it was the marriage-feast for her son,</p>

<p class="indent">Deck herself in garments nobler than her wont.</p>

<p>Since sordid raiment suited not the banquet-hall,</p>

<p class="indent">In magnificent <em>attire</em> all white she clad herself right tastefully.</p>

<p>Hither to the battle came down <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to fight</p>

<p class="indent">In the mother's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash; <em>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a></em> of nature, and <em>the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a></em> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>She looked upon her son as he went forth to be put into the flame;</p>

<p class="indent">And, forasmuch as there was in her the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Lord, she suffered not.</p>

<p>The yearnings of her mother's womb cried out on behalf of its fruit;</p>

<p class="indent">But <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> silenced them, so that their tumult ceased.</p>

<p>Nature shrieked over the limb which was severed from her;</p>

<p class="indent">But the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Lord intoxicated the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that she should not perceive it.</p>

<p>Nature loved, but the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Lord did conquer in the strife</p>

<p class="indent">Within the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the mother, that she should not grieve for her beloved.</p>

<p>And instead of suffering, her heart was filled with all emotions of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>;</p>

<p class="indent">And, instead of mourning, she went forth in splendid apparel.</p>

<p>And she accompanied him as he went out to be burned, and was elate,</p>

<p class="indent">Because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Lord vanquished that of nature.</p>

<p>And <em>clad</em> in white, as for a bridegroom, she made a marriage-feast&mdash; </p>

<p class="indent"> <em>She</em> the mother of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and was blithe because of him.</p>

<p><q>Shamuna the Second</q> may we call this blessed <em>one:</em></p>

<p class="indent">Since, had seven been burned instead of one, she had been well content.</p>

<p>One she had, and she gave him to be food for the fire;</p>

<p class="indent">And, even as that one, if she had had seven, she had given <em>them all</em>.</p>

<p>He was cast into the fire, and the blaze kindled around him;</p>

<p class="indent">And his mother looked on, and grieved not at his burning.</p>

<p>Another eye, which gazes upon the things unseen,</p>

<p class="indent">Was in her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and by reason of this she exulted when he was being burned.</p>

<p>On the gems of light which are in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> crowns she looked,</p>

<p class="indent">And on the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is laid up for them after their sufferings;</p>

<p>And <em>on</em> the promised blessings which they inherit yonder through their afflictions,</p>

<p class="indent">And <em>on</em> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> who clothes their limbs with light;</p>

<p>And <em>on</em> the manifold beauties of that kingdom which shall not be dissolved,</p>

<p class="indent">And <em>on</em> the ample door which is opened for them to enter in to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>On these did the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> mother look when he was being burned,</p>

<p class="indent">And she rejoiced, she exalted, and in white did she go forth with him.</p>

<p>She looked upon him while the fire consumed his frame,</p>

<p class="indent">And, forasmuch as his crown was very noble, she grieved not.</p>

<p>The sweet root was thrown into the fire, upon the coals;</p>

<p class="indent">And it turned to <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and cleansed the air from pollution.</p>

<p>With the fumes of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> had the air been polluted,</p>

<p class="indent">And by the burning of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> was it cleansed.</p>

<p>The firmament was fetid with the exhalations from  the altars;</p>

<p class="indent">And there rose up the sweet perfume of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, and it grew sweet thereby.</p>

<p>And the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> ceased, and there was peace in the assemblies;</p>

<p class="indent">And the sword was blunted, that it should no more lay waste the friends of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>With Sharbil it began, with Habib it ended, in our land;</p>

<p class="indent">And from that time  even until now not one has it slain, since he was burned.</p>

<p>Constantine, chief of conquerors, took the empire,</p>

<p class="indent">And the cross has trampled on the diadem of the emperor, and is set upon his head.</p>

<p>Broken is the lofty horn of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>,</p>

<p class="indent">And from the burning of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> even until now not one has it pierced.</p>

<p>His smoke arose, and it became <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to the Godhead;</p>

<p class="indent">And by it was the air purged which was tainted by paganism,</p>

<p>And by his burning was the whole land cleansed:</p>

<p class="indent">Blessed be he that gave him a crown, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and a good name!</p>

<p> <em>Here</em> ends the Homily on Habib the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, composed by Mar Jacob.</p>
