<h1>Homily on Our Lord</h1>

<p>Therefore let all mouths render praise to Him Who has removed from them <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> speech. Glory to You Who departed from one dwelling to take up your abode in another! That He might come and make us a dwelling-place for His Sender, the only-begotten departed from [being] with Deity and took up His abode in the Virgin; that by a common manner of birth, though only-begotten, He might become the brother of many. And He departed from Sheol and took up His abode in the Kingdom; that He might seek out a path from Sheol which oppresses all, to the Kingdom which requites all. For our Lord gave His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> as a pledge to mortals, that He would remove them from Sheol, which receives the departed without distinction, to the Kingdom which admits the invited with distinction; so that, from [the plan] which makes equal the bodies of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> within it, we may come to [the plan] which distinguishes the works of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> within it. This is He Who descended to Sheol and ascended, that from [the place] which corrupts its sojourners, He might bring us to the place which nourishes with its blessings its dwellers; even those dwellers who, with the possessions, the fruits, and the flowers, of this world, that pass away, have crowned and adorned for themselves there, tabernacles that pass not away. That Firstborn Who was begotten according to His nature, was born in another birth that was external to His nature; that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that after our natural birth we must have another birth which is outside our nature. For He, since He was spiritual, until He came to the corporeal birth, could not be corporeal; in like manner also the corporeal, unless they are born in another birth, cannot be spiritual. But the Son Whose generation is unsearchable, was born in another generation that may be searched out; that by the one we might learn that His Majesty is without limit, and by the other might be taught that His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is without measure. For great is His Majesty without measure, Whose first generation cannot be imagined in any of our thoughts. And His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is abundant without limit, Whose second birth is proclaimed by all mouths.</p>

<p>2. This is He Who was begotten from the Godhead according to His nature, and from manhood not after His nature, and from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> not after His custom; that we might be begotten from manhood according to our nature, and from Godhead not after our nature, and by the Spirit not after our custom. He then was begotten from the Godhead, He that came to a second birth; in order to bring us to the birth that is discoursed of, even His generation from the Father:&mdash; not that it should be searched out, but that it should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>&mdash;and His birth from the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, not that it should be despised, but that it should be exalted. Now His death on the cross witnesses to His birth from the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For He that died was also born. And the Annunciation of Gabriel declares His generation by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, namely [the power of the Highest shall overshadow you]. <span class="stiki" id="note370557"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;1:35</a></span> If then it was the power of the Highest, it is plain that it was not the seed of mortal man. So then His conception in the womb is bound up with His death on the cross; and His first generation is bound up with the declaration of the Angel; in order that whoso denies His birth may be confuted by His crucifixion, and whoso supposes that His beginning was from Mary, may be admonished that His Godhead is before all; so that whoever has concluded His beginning to be corporeal, [may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> hereby that His issuing forth from the Father is narrated]. The Father begot Him, and through Him created the creatures. Flesh bare Him and through Him slew <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. Baptism brought him forth, that through Him it might wash away stains. Sheol brought Him forth, that through Him its treasures might be emptied out. He came to us from beside His Father by the way of them that are born: and by the way of them that die, He went forth to go to His Father; so that by His coming through birth, His advent might be seen; and by His returning through resurrection, His departure might be confirmed.</p>

<p>3. But our Lord was trampled on by Death; and in His turn trod out a way over Death. This is He Who made Himself subject to and endured death of His own will, that He might cast down death against his will. For our Lord bare His cross and went forth according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Death: but He cried upon the cross <span class="stiki" id="note370558"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse50">Matthew&nbsp;27:50-52</a></span> and brought forth the dead from within Sheol against the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Death. For in that very thing by which Death had slain Him [<em>i.e</em>., the body], in that as armour He bore off the victory over Death. But the Godhead concealed itself in the manhood and fought against Death, Death slew and was slain. Death slew the natural life; and the supernatural life slew Him. And because Death was not able to devour Him without the body, nor Sheol to swallow Him up without the flesh, He came unto the Virgin, that from thence He might obtain that which should bear Him to Sheol; as from beside the ass they brought for Him the colt whereon He entered Jerusalem, and proclaimed concealing her overthrow and the destruction of her children. With the body then that [was] from the Virgin, He entered Sheol and plundered its storehouses and emptied its treasures. He came then to Eve the Mother of all living. This is the vine whose fence Death laid open by her own hands, and caused her to taste of his fruits. So Eve the Mother of all living became the well-spring of death to all living. But Mary budded forth, a new shoot from Eve the ancient vine; and new life dwelt in her, that when Death should come confidently after his custom to feed upon mortal fruits, the life that is slayer of death might be stored up [therein] against him; that when Death should have swallowed [the fruits] without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, he might vomit them forth and with them many. For [He Who is] the Medicine of life flew down from heaven, and was mingled in the body, the mortal fruit. And when Death came to feed after his custom, the Life in His turn swallowed up Death. This is the food that hungered to eat its eater. So then, by one fruit which Death swallowed hungrily, he vomited up many lives which he had swallowed greedily. The hunger then which hurried him against one, emptied out his greed which had hurried him against many. Thus Death was diligent to swallow one, but was in haste to set many free. For while One was dying on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, many that were buried from within Sheol were coming forth at His cry. <span class="stiki" id="note370559"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse50">Matthew&nbsp;27:50-53</a></span> This is the fruit that cleft asunder Death who had swallowed it, and brought out from within it the Life in quest of which it was sent. For Sheol hid away all that she had devoured. But through One that was not devoured, all that she had devoured were restored from within her. He, whose stomach is disordered, vomits forth both that which is sweet to him and that which is not sweet. So the stomach of Death was disordered, and as he was vomiting forth the medicine of life which had sickened it, he vomited forth along with it also those lives that had been swallowed by him with pleasure.</p>

<p>4. This is the Son of the carpenter, Who skilfully made His cross a bridge over Sheol that swallows up all, and brought over <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> into the dwelling of life. And because it was through the tree that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> had fallen into Sheol, so upon the tree they passed over into the dwelling of life. Through the tree then wherein bitterness was tasted, through it also sweetness was tasted; that we might learn of Him that among the creatures nothing resists Him. Glory be to You, Who laid Your cross as a bridge over death, that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> might pass over upon it from the dwelling of the dead to the dwelling of life!</p>

<p>5. The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> praise You that Your Word has become a mirror before them, that in it they might see death, secretly swallowing up their lives. But graven images were being adorned by their artificers; and by their adornments were disfiguring their adorners. But You drew them to Your cross; and while the beauties of the body were disfigured upon it, the beauties of the mind shone forth upon it. Then, as for the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> who used to go after gods which were no gods, He Who was God went after them, and by His words, as by a bridle, turned them from many gods to the One. This is that Mighty One, Whose preaching became a bridle in the jaws of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and led them away from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to Him that sent Him. But the dead <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, with their closed mouths, used to feed on the life of their worshippers. On this account You mingled in their flesh that blood of Yours, by which death was enfeebled and laid low; that the mouths of their devourers might be driven away from their lives. Also because <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> slew You and was defiled by Your blood, that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, that had been engrafted upon him was driven away from him on account of Your blood. For he was weaned from that <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> through Your blood; because that from it, he had never before been weaned.</p>

<p>6. But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> crucified our Lord, on the plea that verily He was seducing us from the One God. But they themselves used constantly to wander away from the One God through their many <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. While then they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> they crucify Him Who seduces them from the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are found to be led away by Him from all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to the One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; to the end that because they did not voluntarily learn of Him that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they might by compulsion learn of Him that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; when the good which had accrued to them through Him should accuse them concerning the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which their hands had done. Thus even though the tongue of the oppressors denied, yet the help with which they were helped convicted them. For <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> loaded them beyond their power, so that they should be ashamed, while laden with Your blessings, to deny Your person. And also You had mercy on those, whose lives had been made food for dead <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. For the one calf which they made in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note370560"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse4">Exodus&nbsp;32:4</a></span> pastured on their lives as on grass in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. For that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> which they had stolen and brought out in their hearts from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, when it was made manifest, slew openly those in whom it was dwelling secretly. For it was like fire concealed in wood, which when it is gendered from within it, burns it. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> ground to powder the calf and caused them to drink it in the water of ordeal; <span class="stiki" id="note370561"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;32:20</a></span> that by drinking of the calf all those who were living for its worship might die. For the sons of Levi ran upon them, those who ran to [help] <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and girded on their swords.  For the sons of Levi did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whom they should slay, because those that worshipped were mingled with those that worshipped not. But He, for Whom it was easy to distinguish, distinguished those who were defiled from those who were not defiled; so that the innocent might give thanks that their innocence had not passed [unseen by] the Just One; and the guilty might be convicted that their offense had not escaped [the eye of] the Judge. But the sons of Levi were the open avengers. Accordingly <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> set a mark upon the offenders, that it might be easy for the avengers to avenge. For the draught of the calf entered those in whom the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the calf was dwelling, and displayed in them a manifest sign, that the drawn sword might rush upon them. The congregation therefore which had committed fornication in [the worship of] the calf, he caused to drink of the water of ordeal, that the mark of adulteresses might appear in it. From hence was derived that law about <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note370563"><a href="../bible/num005.htm#verse17">Numbers&nbsp;5:17-27</a></span> that they should drink the water of ordeal, that by the mark that came on adulteresses, the congregation might be reminded of its fornication that was in the worship of the calf, and be on its guard with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> against another [fornication]; and remember the former [fornication] with penitence of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and that when they were judging their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, if they played the harlot against them, they might condemn themselves, who were playing the harlot against their God.</p>

<p>7. To You be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> who by Your cross hast taken away the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> in which both <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> and uncircumcised were caused to stumble! To You be praise, the medicine of life, Who hast converted all that are baptised, to Him Who is life of all, and Lord of all! The lost that are found bless You; for by the finding of the lost, You have given <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that are found and were not lost. The uncircumcised praise You, for in Your peace the enmity that was between is swallowed up, for You received in Your flesh the outward sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, through which the uncircumcised that were Yours, used to be accounted as not Yours. For You made as Your sign the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the heart; by which the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> were made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, that they were not Yours. For You came to Your own <span class="stiki" id="note370564"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;1:2</a></span> and Your own received You not; and by this they were made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that they were not Yours. But they to whom You did not come, through Your mercy cry out after You, that You would satisfy them with the crumbs which fall from the children's table.</p>

<p>8. God was sent from the Godhead, to come and convict the graven images that they were no gods. And when He took away from them the name of God which decked them out, then appeared the blemishes of their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. And their blemishes were these&mdash;They have eyes and see not, and ears and hear not.  Your preaching persuaded their many worshippers to change their many gods for the One. For in that You took away the name of godhead from the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, worship also along with the name was withdrawn; that, namely, which is bound up with the name; for worship also attends on the Name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Because, then, worship also was rendered to the Name, by all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, at the last the worshipful Name shall be gathered in entirely to its Lord. Therefore at the last worship, also shall be gathered in completely to its Lord, that it may be fulfilled that <em>all things shall be subjected to Him</em>. Then, He in His turn <em>shall be subjected to Him Who subjected all things to Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370566"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:27-28</a></span> So that that Name, rising from degree to degree, shall be bound up with its root. For when all creatures shall be bound by their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the Son through Whom they were created, and the Son shall be bound by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of that Father by Whom He was begotten, all creatures shall give thanks at the last to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, through Whom they received all blessings; and in Him and with Him they shall give thanks also to His Father, from Whose treasure He distributes all riches to us.</p>

<p>9. Glory be to You Who clothed Yourself in the body of mortal Adam, and made it a fountain of life for all mortals. You are He that livest, for Your slayers were as husbandmen to Your life, for that they sowed it as wheat in the depth [of the earth], that it may rise and raise up many with it. Come, let us make our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the great censer of the community, and offer on it as <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> our <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> and our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to Him Who made His cross a censer for the Godhead, and offered from it on behalf of us all. He that was above stooped down to those who were beneath, to distribute His treasures to them. Accordingly, though the needy drew near to His manhood, yet they used to receive the gift from His Godhead. Therefore He made the body which He put on, the treasurer of His riches, that He, O Lord, might bring them out of Your storehouse, and distribute them to the needy, the sons of His kindred.</p>

<p>10. Glory be to Him Who received from us that He might give to us; that through that which is ours we might more abundantly receive of that which is His! Yea through that Mediator, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> was able to receive life from its helper, as through a Mediator it had received in the beginning death from its slayer. You are He Who made for Yourself the body as a servant, that through it You might give to them that desire You, all that they desire. Moreover in You were made visible the hidden wishes of them that slew [You] and buried [You]; through this, that You clothed Yourself in a body. For taking occasion by that body of Yours, Your slayers slew You, and were slain by You; and taking occasion by Your body, Your buriers buried You, and were raised up with You. That Power Which may not be handled came down and clothed itself in members that may be touched; that the needy may draw near to Him, that in touching His manhood they may discern His Godhead. For that dumb man [whom the Lord healed] with the fingers of the body, discerned that He had approached his ears and touched his tongue; <span class="stiki" id="note370567"><a href="../bible/mar007.htm#verse32">Mark&nbsp;7:32-37</a></span> nay, with his fingers that may be touched, he touched Godhead, that may not be touched; when it was loosing the string of his tongue, and opening the clogged doors of his ears. For the Architect of the body and Artificer of the flesh came to him, and with His gentle voice pierced without pain his thickened ears. And his mouth which was closed up, that it could not give birth to a word, gave birth to praise to Him Who made its barrenness fruitful in the birth of words. He, then, Who gave to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> that he should speak at once without teaching, Himself gave to the dumb that they should speak easily, tongues that are learned with difficulty.</p>

<p>11. Lo, again, another question is made clear:&mdash; We enquire in what tongues our Lord gave the power of speaking to the dumb, who from all tongues came unto Him? And although this be easy to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, yet our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> impels us to that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is greater than this. That [<a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>] then is, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that through the Son the first man was made. For in this fact, that through Him speech was given to the dumb, the sons of Adam, we may learn that through Him speech was given to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> their first father. And here also defective nature was supplied by our Lord. He, then, Who was able to supply the defect of nature,&mdash; it is manifest that through Him is established the supplying of nature. But there is no greater defect than this, when a man is born without speech. For since it is in this, in speech, that we excel all the creatures, the defect of it is greater than all [other] defects. He, then, through Whom all this defect was supplied&mdash;it is manifest that through Him all fullness is established. But because through Him the members receive all fullness in the womb secretly, through Him their defect was supplied openly; that we might learn that through Him in the beginning the whole frame was constituted. He spat then on His fingers and placed them in the ears of that deaf man; and He mixed clay of His spittle, and spread it upon the eyes of the blind man; <span class="stiki" id="note370568"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;9:6</a></span> that we might learn that as there was defect in the eyeballs of that man who was blind from his mother's womb, so there was defect in the ears of this [man]. So then, by leaven from the body of Him Who completes, the defect of our formation is supplied. For it was not meet that our Lord should have cut off anything from His body to supply the deficiency of other bodies; but with that which could be taken away from Him, He supplied the deficiency of them that lacked; just as in that which can be eaten, mortals eat Him. He supplied then the deficiency, and gave life to mortality, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that from the body in which fullness dwelt, the deficiency of them that lacked was supplied; and from the body in which life dwelt, <span class="stiki" id="note370569"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse9">Colossians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> life was given to mortals.</p>

<p>12. Now the Prophets performed all [other] signs; but on no occasion supplied the deficiency of members. But the deficiency of the body was reserved, that it should be supplied through our Lord; that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> might perceive that it is through Him that every deficiency must be supplied. It is meet, then, that the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> should perceive that He Who supplies the deficiencies of the creatures, is Master of the formative power of the Creator. But when He was upon earth, our Lord gave to the deaf [and dumb], [the power] of hearing and of speaking tongues which they had not learned; that after He had ascended, [men] might understand that He gave to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> [the power] of speaking in every tongue.</p>

<p>13. Now the crucifiers supposed when our Lord was dead that His signs had died with Him. But His signs manifestly continued to live through His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; that the murderers might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Lord of the signs was living. Beforehand His murderers made trouble, crying out that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had stolen His corpse. But, afterwards, His signs performed through His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, filled them with trouble. For His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who were supposed to have stolen the dead corpse, were found to be raising to life the dead corpses of others. But the ungodly were terrified and said&mdash;<q>His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have stolen His body;</q> that they might be held in contempt when it should be discovered. But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, who [they said] stole the dead body from the living guards, were found to be assailing Death in the name of Him Who was stolen; that [Death] might not steal the life of the living. So then, before He was crucified, He gave the deaf the power of hearing, that after He was crucified, all ears should hear and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. For beforehand He confirmed our hearing by [the word] of the dumb whose mouth was opened, that it should not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning the preaching of the Word. Our Redeemer was in every way equipped, that in every way He might rescue us from our captor. For our Lord did not merely clothe Himself in a body, but also arrayed Himself in members and in garments; that through His members and His garments, they that were afflicted with plagues might be encouraged to approach the treasury of healing, that they who were encouraged by His mercy might approach His body and they who were dismayed by His terror might approach His vesture. For with one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> her <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> suffered her merely to approach the hem of His raiment; <span class="stiki" id="note370570"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;9:20</a></span> but with another, her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> impelled her even to approach His flesh.  Now by her who received healing by His garments, those were put to shame who did not receive healing from His words; and by her who kissed His feet, he was rebuked who did not desire to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> His lips.</p>

<p>14. Now our Lord bestowed great gifts through small means; that He might teach us of what they are deprived who have scorned great things. For if from the hem of His garment, healing like this was secretly stolen, could He not assuredly heal when His word distinctly granted healing? And if defiled lips were sanctified by kissing His feet, how much more should not pure lips be sanctified by kissing His mouth? For the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by her kisses received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of His sacred feet, which had come with toil to bring her remission of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. She was refreshing the feet of her Healer with oil freely, for freely had He brought her the treasure of healing for her sickness. For it was not for the sake of his stomach that He Who satisfies the hungry was a guest; but for the sake of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> repentance He Who justifies sinners made Himself a guest.</p>

<p>15. For it was not for the dainties of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> that our Lord hungered, but for the tears of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> He was an hungered. For when He was satisfied and refreshed by the tears for which He hungered, He turned and rebuked him who had bidden Him to the food that passes away, that He might show that it was not for the sake of food for the body that He had become a guest, but for the sake of help to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For it was not for the sake of pleasure that our Lord mingled with gluttonous men and winebibbers, as the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> supposed; but that in their food as mortals He might mingle for them His teaching as the medicine of life. For even as it was in the matter of eating that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> gave his deadly counsel to <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and his helpmeet, so in the matter of eating the Good Lord gave His life-giving counsel to the sons of Adam. For He was the fisherman Who came down to fish for the lives of the lost. He saw the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and harlots rushing into prodigality and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>; and He hastened to spread His nets among their places of assembly, that He might capture them from food that fattens bodies, to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> that fattens <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<p>16. Now the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> made great preparations for our Lord in His banquet; and the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> did but little things for Him there. Yet he by his great dainties displayed the smallness of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to our Lord; but she by her tears displayed the greatness of her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>. Thus he that had invited Him to the great banquet was rebuked because of the smallness of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but she by her few tears atoned for the many follies of her offenses. Simon the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> received our Lord as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; because of the signs, and not because of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For he was a son of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, who when signs drew near, himself also drew near to the Lord of the signs; and when the signs ceased, he also stood naked without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This man also when he saw our Lord with signs, esteemed Him as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; but when our Lord ceased from signs, the doubting mind of the sons of his people entered him. <em>This man if He had been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, He would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is a sinner.</em> But our Lord for Whom in every place all things are easy, here also did not cease from His signs. For He saw that because He had ceased a little from signs, the blind mind of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> had turned away from Him. For he had said in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, <em>This man, had He been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, He would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a></em>. In this reflection therefore the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> concerning our Lord, whether He were a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or no; but by this very reflection he learned that He is Lord of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; so that from the source from which <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> entered him, from that source our Lord might bring help to Him.</p>

<p>17. Our Lord then told him the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the two debtors; and made him judge; that by his tongue He might catch him in whose heart the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was not. <em> One owed five hundred dinars</em>. Here then our Lord showed to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> the multitude of the offenses of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. He then who imagined concerning our Lord that He did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that she was a sinner, in the result heard from Him how great was the debt of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, then, who imagined that our Lord did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who she was, and what was the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, was found himself not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who our Lord was, and what was His <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. Thus he was reproved in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, who did not even perceive his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> that he was assuredly erring eluded him in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But he received a reminder from Him Who came to remind them that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> had seen great signs done by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, as <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; but because there was not <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in him, that those prodigies which he saw might be conjoined with that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a little <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> hindered and annulled them. <em>Had this man been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, he would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is a sinner</em>. For he let slip the wonders that he had seen, and blindness readily entered into him. For he was of the sons of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whom terrible signs accompanied up to the sea, that they might <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; and blessed <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> surrounded in the waste desert, that they might be reconciled; but through lack of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for a slight <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, they rejected them [saying]; <em>As for this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who brought us up, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what has become of him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370572"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;32:1</a></span> For they ceased to regard the mighty works that had been surrounding them. They perceived that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was not near them; so that for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that had come near, they drew [near] to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was for a little removed from before them, that the calf that was before them might appear, that they might worship it openly also; for they had been secretly worshipping it in their hearts.</p>

<p>18. But when their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> from being inward became open, then <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> also from being hidden openly appeared; that he might openly punish those whose <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> had revelled beneath the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> cloud which had overshadowed them. But God removed the Shepherd of the flock from it for forty days, that the flock might show that its trust was fixed upon the calf. While God was feeding the flock with all delights, it chose for itself as its Shepherd the calf, which was not able even to eat. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who kept them in awe was removed from them, that the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> might cry aloud in their mouths, which the restraint of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had kept down in their hearts. For they cried: <em>Make us gods, to go before us</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370573"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;32:1</a></span> </p>

<p>19. But when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> came down, he saw their <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> revelling in the wide plain with drums and cymbals. Speedily, he put their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to shame by means of the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> and drawn swords. So likewise here, our Lord concealed His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> for a little when the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> approached Him, that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> might form into shape his thought, as his fathers had shaped the pernicious calf. But when the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee's</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> came to a head within him, then the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of our Lord was manifested against it and dispelled it; <em>I entered into your house; you gave Me no water for My feet: But she has moistened them with her tears. Therefore her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are many are forgiven her</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370574"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;7:44-47</a></span> But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> when he heard our Lord naming the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <em>many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>, was greatly put to shame because he had greatly erred. For he had supposed that our Lord did not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that she was a sinner. Our Lord had before shown Himself as though not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> her for a sinner. For He allowed him who had seen His signs, to show the <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that it might become manifest that his mind was bound in the ungodliness of his fathers. But the physician, who by his medicines brings out the hidden disease, is not the helper of the disease but its destroyer. For while the disease is hidden, it rules in the members, but when it is made manifest by medicines, it is rooted out. So then the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> saw great things and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> about small things. But when our Lord saw that his littleness made little of great things in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, He speedily showed him not only that she was a sinner, but even the multitude of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; that he might be put to shame by little things&mdash;he who had not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in wonders.</p>

<p>20. God gave room to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to enlarge its <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> in the wide desert; whom God cut short with whetted sword, that their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> might not be spread abroad among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. So our Lord allowed the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> perverse things, that He might in turn duly reprove his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. For concerning those things which the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was doing rightly, the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> was thinking wrongly. But our Lord in His turn rebuked him, concerning the right things which he had wrongly withheld: <em> I</em>  <em>entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet</em>. Behold the withholding of that which was due! <em>But she has moistened them with her tears</em>. Behold the payment of what was due! <em>You did not anoint Me with oil</em>. Behold the token of neglect! <em> But she has anointed My feel with sweet ointment</em>. Behold the sign of <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>! You did not <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> Me. Behold the testimony of enmity! But she has not ceased to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> My feet. Behold the sign of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>! So then, by this enumeration our Lord showed that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> owed Him all those things and had withheld them; but that the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had come in and rendered all those things which he had withheld. Because then she had paid the debts of him who wrongfully withheld them, the Just One forgave her, her own debt, even her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>21. Now the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, while he was doubting concerning our Lord, that He was not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, pledged himself to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> unawares, in saying&mdash; <em>Had this man been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, he would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is a sinner</em>. Therefore, if it should be found that our Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that she was a sinner, He is, according to your word, O <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. Our Lord, therefore, hastened to show both that she was a sinner, and that her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were many; that the testimony of his own mouth might confute him as a liar. For he was companion of those that said: <em>Who is able to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only</em>? <span class="stiki" id="note370575"><a href="../bible/mar002.htm#verse7">Mark&nbsp;2:7</a></span> For from them our Lord received testimony, that, therefore, He Who is able to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thenceforth, then, the contention was this, that our Lord should show them whether He was able to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> or no. So He speedily healed the members that were visible, that it might be made sure that He had forgiven the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that were invisible. For our Lord cast before them the word which was expected to catch him that said it; so that when they should rush forward to catch Him by it, according to their wish, they might be caught by Him according to His wish. <em>Fear not, My son, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370576"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;9:2</a></span> While they were hastening to catch Him on the charge of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, they pledged themselves unawares to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <em>Who is able forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only?</em> Accordingly, our Lord confuted them [as though saying]: <q>If I shall have shown that I am able to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even though you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Me that I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; yet abide by your word, which determined that whoso forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Therefore that our Lord might teach them that He forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He forgave that man his hidden <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and caused him to carry his bed openly; that by the carrying of the bed which carries [those that lie on it], they might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the slaying of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that slays.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful thing, that while our Lord there called Himself the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, His adversaries, unawares, made Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Accordingly, while they supposed that they had ensnared Him by their craftiness, He entangled them in their craftiness; He made it a testimony to His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. So their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts became unto them as bitter bonds; and that they might not free themselves from their bonds, our Lord strengthened them by giving strength to him [to whom He said]&mdash; <em>Arise, take up your bed and go into your house</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370577"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;9:6</a></span> For the testimony could not again be undone, as though He were not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; inasmuch as He forgave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Nor yet could it be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> affirmed that He had not forgiven <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; for lo! He had healed [men's] limbs. For our Lord bound up His hidden testimonies in those which were manifest; that their own testimony might choke the infidels. Accordingly our Lord made their thoughts to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against them, because they had warred with the Good One, who by His healing power warred against their diseases. For that which Simon the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> imagined, and that which the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> his companions imagined, they imagined in their hearts secretly; but our Lord spread it forth openly. Our Lord represented their hidden imaginations  before them, that they might learn that His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> reveals and shows their secret things(;) so that though they had not recognized Him by His open signs, they might recognize Him when He represented their secret imaginations; and that if only but by this&mdash;that He searched out their hearts&mdash;their hearts might perceive that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;that at least when they saw that their imaginations could not be hidden from Him, they might cease from imagining <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against Him. For they had imagined <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in their heart; but He exposed it openly, by this [word] <em>Why are you imagining <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your heart?</em> So that by this, that our Lord perceived their hidden imagination, they should recognize His hidden Godhead. For that Godhead, by this very thing that they in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> were reviling it, was by that reviling made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them. For they reviled our Lord in the body, and supposed that He was not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and cast Him down below from on high; but by the body He was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them as being <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by that body which was found passing to and fro among them. For they, by casting Him down to the depth, attempted to show this, that God Who is above, cannot in bodily wise be born below. But He by His passage up to the height, taught them this; that for the body also that is sent down below, it is not its nature to pass up to the height rather than down to the depths; so that by the body which from below passed on high upwards in the air, they might learn of God that by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> He descended down below from on high.</p>

<p>22. But why instead of a stern reproof did our Lord speak a <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of persuasion to that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>? He spoke the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> to him tenderly, that he, though froward, might unawares be enticed to correct his perversities. For the waters that are congealed by the force of a cold wind, the heat of the sun gently dissolves. So our Lord did not at once oppose him harshly, that he might not give occasion to the rebellious to rebel again. But by blandishment He brought him under the yoke, that when he had been yoked, He might work with him, though rebellious, according to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Now, because Simon was proudly minded, our Lord began humbly with him, that He might not be to him a teacher according to his folly. For if that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> retained the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees'</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, how could our Lord <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> him to acquire humility, when the treasure of humility was not under his hand? But since our Lord was teaching humility to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, He showed that His treasury was free from every form of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. But this was for our sakes, that He might teach us, that whatever treasuries <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> enters into, it is by boastfulness that it gains access to them. On this account <em>let not your left hand <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what your right hand does</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370578"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;2:3</a></span> Our Lord then did not employ harsh reproof, because His coming was of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: He did not refrain from reproof, because His later coming will be of retribution. For He put men to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in His coming of humility; because <em>it is a fearful thing to fall into His hands</em> <span class="stiki" id="note370579"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse31">Hebrews&nbsp;10:31</a></span> when He shall come <em>in flaming fire</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370580"><a href="../bible/2th001.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;1:7-8</a></span> But our Lord bestowed the most part of His helps rather by persuasion than by reproof. For the gentle shower softens the earth and penetrates all through it: but violent rain binds and hardens the face of the earth, so that it does not receive it. For a harsh word excites <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, and with it are bound up wrongs. And when a harsh word has opened the door, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> enters in, and at the heels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, along with it enter in wrongs.</p>

<p>23. But because all helps attend on <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> speech, He who came to render help employed it. Observe how mighty is the power of a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> word; for lo! By it vehement <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is put down, and by it the billows of a swelling mind are calmed. But hear whence this was. That <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> thought, <em>had this man been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, he would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a></em>. Contempt as well as <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> can be discerned here. Hear how our Lord in reply encountered this:  <em>Simon, I have somewhat to say unto you</em>. Love and reproof can be discerned here. For this is a word of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> such as friends use with their friends. For when an adversary reproaches his adversary, he speaks not to him like this; for the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> does not allow enemies to speak reasonably one to another. But He Who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for them that crucified Him, that He might show that the fury of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> had no power over Him, was about to put to the question those that crucified Him, that He might show that He was governed by reason and not by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</p>

<p>24. Accordingly, our Lord placed a word of conciliation at the beginning of His speech, that by conciliation He might pacify the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, into whose mind discord and division had entered. He was the physician who ranged His cures against the things hurtful [to men]. Our Lord then shot forth this word as an arrow, and set in the head of it conciliation as the barb. And He anointed it with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that soothes the members; so that when it flew into him who was full of discord, he was at once changed from discord to harmony. For straightway upon hearing that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> voice of our Lord, saying&mdash; <em>Simon, I have somewhat to say unto you</em>, that secret despiser returned his answer, <em>Say on, Lord</em>. For the sweet voice entered his bitter <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and begot of it pleasant fruit. For he who before this voice was one that secretly despised, after this voice became one that openly honoured. For humility, by its sweet utterance, subdues even its adversaries into rendering it <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. For it is not over its friends that humility tests its power, but over its enemies it exhibits its victories.</p>

<p>25. Thus the heavenly King arrayed Himself in armour of humility, and so conquered the bitter one, and drew from him a good answer as a sure pledge [of victory]. This is the armour concerning which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, that by it <em>we <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> the loftiness that exalts itself against the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370581"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:5</a></span> For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had received the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of it in himself. For as he had been warring in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but was conquered in humility, so is to be conquered every <em>lofty thing which exalts itself</em> against this humility. For Saul was journeying to subdue the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with hard words, but the Master of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> subdued him with a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> word. For when He to whom all things are possible manifested Himself to him, giving up all things else, He spoke to him in humility alone, that He might teach us that a soft tongue is more effectual than all things else against hard thoughts. For neither threats nor words of terror were heard by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but weak words not able to avenge themselves: <em>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me</em>? <span class="stiki" id="note370582"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4</a></span> But the words which were thought not even capable of avenging themselves, were found to be taking vengeance by drawing him away from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and making him a goodly vessel. He who was full of the bitter will of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, was then filled with the sweet preaching of the cross. When he was filled with the bitterness of the crucifiers, in his bitterness he made havoc of the churches. But when he was filled with the sweetness of the Crucified, he embittered the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of the crucifiers. Our Lord then strove with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> voice with him, who had been warring against His churches with hard bonds. Thus Saul, who had been binding the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with bitter chains, was bound with pleasant persuasions; that he might not again cast the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> into bonds; since he was bound by the Crucified, Who puts to silence <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> voices, whom all they that were set against Him could not bind or injure. But when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> ceased from binding the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, he himself was bound with chains by the persecutors. But when he was bound with chains, he loosed the bonds of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> by his bonds.</p>

<p>26. <em>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</em> He who had conquered His persecutors in the world below, and ruled over the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in the world above, spoke from above with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> voice. And He Who while He was upon earth had denounced ten woes against His crucifiers, when He was in heaven, did not denounce even one woe against Saul, His persecutor. Now, our Lord denounced woe to His crucifiers, that He might teach His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not to be dismayed by His murderers. But our Lord spoke in humility from heaven, that in humility the heads of His church might speak. And if any one should say, <q>Wherein did our Lord speak humbly with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? For lo! The eyes of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> were grievously smitten;</q> let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was not from our merciful Lord that this chastisement proceeded, who spoke those words in humility; but from the vehement light that vehemently shone forth there. And this light did not strike <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> by way of retribution on account of his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but on account of the vehemence of its rays it hurt him, as he also said: <em>When I arose, I could discern nothing for the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the light</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370583"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;22:11</a></span> But if that light was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, O <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, how did the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> light become a blinding light to you yourself? The light was that which, according to its nature, illuminates above, but contrary to its nature, it shone forth below. When it illumined above, it was delightful; but when it shone forth below, it was blinding. For the light was both grievous and pleasant. It was grievous and violent towards the eyes of the flesh; and it was pleasant and lightful to those who are fire and spirit. <span class="stiki" id="note370584"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;4:11</a></span> </p>

<p>27. <em>For I saw a light from heaven that excelled the sun, and its light shone upon me</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370585"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;26:13</a></span> So then mighty rays streamed forth without moderation, and were poured upon feeble eyes, which moderate rays refresh. For, lo! The sun also in measure assists the eyes, but beyond measure and out of measure it injures the eyes. And it is not by way of vengeance in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that it smites them. For lo! It is the friend of the eyes and beloved of the eyeballs. And this is a marvel; while with its gentle lustre it befriends and assists the eyes; yet by its vehement rays it is hostile to and injures the eyeballs. But if the sun which is here below, and of kindred nature with the eyes that are here below, yet injures them, in vehemence and not in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, in its proper force and not in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; how much more should the light that is from above, akin to the things that are above, by its vehemence injure a man here below who has suddenly gazed upon that which is not akin to his nature? For since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> might have been injured by the vehemence of this sun to which he was accustomed, if he gazed upon it not according to custom, how much more should he be injured by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of that light to which his eyes never had been accustomed? For behold, Daniel also <span class="stiki" id="note370586"><a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse5">Daniel&nbsp;10:5-6</a></span> was melted and poured out on every side before the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, whose vehement brightness suddenly shone upon him! And it was not because of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness was melted, just as it is not on account of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> or hostility of fire that wax is melted before it; but on account of the weakness of the wax it cannot keep firm and stand in presence of fire. When then the two approach one another, the power of the fire by its quality prevails; but the weakness of the wax on the other hand is brought lower even than its former weakness.</p>

<p>28. But the majesty of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was manifested in itself; the weakness of flesh in itself could not endure. For <em>my inward parts were turned into corruption</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370587"><a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse8">Daniel&nbsp;10:8</a></span> But yet men see men, their fellows, and faint before them: Yet it is not by their bright splendour that they are moved, but by their harsh will. For servants are terrified by the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of their masters, and those that are judged tremble through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of their judges. But this did not befall Daniel on account of threatening or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> from the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; but on account of his terrible nature and prevailing brightness. For it was not with threatening, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came to him. For if he had come with threatening, how could a mouth full of threatening become full of peace, when it came, saying, <em>Peace be unto you, you man</em> of desire?  Thus that mouth that was a fountain of thunderings&mdash; <em>for the voice of his words was like the voice of many hosts</em>, <span class="stiki" id="note370589"><a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse6">Daniel&nbsp;10:6</a></span> that voice became to him a fountain teeming with and containing peace. And when [the voice] reached the terrified ears which were thirsty for the encouraging greeting of peace, there was opened and poured out [for Daniel] a draught of peace. And by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> later [word of] peace, those ears were encouraged, which had been terrified by his former voice first. For [he said], <em>Let my Lord speak because I have been strengthened</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370590"><a href="../bible/dan010.htm#verse19">Daniel&nbsp;10:19</a></span> But because in that heart-moving vision the fiery <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> was about to announce nothing concerning Him, [the Lord], on this account that majesty [of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>] was forward to give the salutation of peace to the lowliness [of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>]; that by the gladdening salutation which that awful majesty gave, the dread should be removed which lay on the mind of the lowliness and that was terrified.</p>

<p>29. But what shall we say about the Lord of the Angel, Who said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>&mdash; <em>No man shall see Me and live</em>? <span class="stiki" id="note370591"><a href="../bible/exo033.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;33:20</a></span> Is it on account of the fury of His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, that whoso shall see Him shall die? Or on account of the splendour of His Being? For that Being was not made and was not created: so that eyes which have been made and created cannot look upon it. For if it is on account of His fury that whoso shall look upon Him shall not live, lo! He would have granted to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to see Him because of His great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to him. Accordingly, the Self-Existent by His vision slays them that look upon Him; but He slays, not because of harsh fury but because of His potent splendour. Because of this He in His great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> granted to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to see His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; yet in the same great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> He restrained him from seeing His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But it was not that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His majesty would have been at all diminished, but that weak eyes could not suffice to bear the overpowering billows of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> desired that the vision of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should be directed upon the goodly brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> did not desire that the vision of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should be blinded amidst the potent rays of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saw and saw not. He saw, that he might be exalted; he saw not, that he might not be injured. For by that which he saw, his lowliness was exalted; and by that which he saw not, his weakness was not blinded. As also our eyes look upon the sun and look not upon it; and by what they see are assisted; and by what they see not, are uninjured. Thus the eye sees, that it may be benefited; but it ventures not [to look], that it may not be injured. So then through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God hindered <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from seeing that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that was too hard for his eyes: As also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> through his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> prevented the children of his people from seeing the brightness that was too strong for their eyes. For he learned from Him Who covered him, and spread His hand, and hid from him the splendour of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that it might not injure him; so that he also should spread the veil and conceal from the feeble ones the overpowering splendour, that it might not hurt them. Now when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> saw that the sons of perishable flesh could not gaze upon the borrowed <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that was on his face, his heart failed within him; for that he had sought to dare to gaze upon the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Eternal Being; in whose floods, lo! Those above and those below are plunged and spring forth; the depths whereof none can fathom; the shores whereof none can reach; whereof no end or limit can be found.</p>

<p>30. Now if any one should say, <q>Was it not then possible for God [to bring it to pass] that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> should look upon that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and not be injured; and that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> likewise should look upon the light and take no hurt?</q> Let him that says this understand that though it is possible for the power and overruling force of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the eyes should change their nature; yet it is inconsistent with the wisdom and nature of God that the order of nature should be confused. For, lo! It is also easy for the arm of the artificer to destroy [his fabrics]; but it is inconsistent with the good sense of the artificer to ruin goodly ornaments. And if any one wishes to say, concerning something which to himself seems meet&mdash;<q>It were meet for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to do this;</q> let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is meet for himself not to speak thus concerning God. For the chief of all things meet is this: that a man should not teach God what is meet. For it becomes not man to become God's instructor. For this is a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that we should become teachers to Him, of Whom these created mouths of ours are unable to tell, in the formation of His handiwork. For it is an unpardonable iniquity, that the mouth in its boldness should teach what is proper to that God by Whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> it learned to speak at all. If any one then shall say, <q>It had been meet for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to do this,</q> I also, because I have a mouth and a tongue, may say, <q>It had been meet for God not to give to man freedom by which he thus reproaches Him Who is not to be reproached.</q> But I do not dare to say that it was not meet for Him to give it; lest I also make myself an instructor of Him Who is not to be instructed. For because He is just, He would have been reproached by Himself, had He not given freedom to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as though through grudging He had withheld from lowly man the gift that makes great. Therefore He gave it betimes by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, that He might not be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> reproached by Himself; even though through freedom, His own gift, lo! <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a> wickedly reproach Him.</p>

<p>31. Now why were the eyes of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> made to shine because of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which he saw, while on the contrary [the eyes of] <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, instead of being made to shine, were made utterly blind? Yet we may be sure that the eyes of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were not stronger than those of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; for they were akin in one brotherhood of blood and flesh. But another power through <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> sustained the eyes of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; whereas no power was added in mercy to the eyes of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, beyond their natural power, which in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> was taken from them. But if we say that their natural power was taken away from them, and that [it was] on this account he was defeated and overcome by the overpowering light&mdash;for had their natural power remained, they would have been able to endure that supernatural light. Yet let us be sure of this, that as often as anything transcendent is revealed, that surpasses and transcends our nature, our natural power is not able to stand before it. But if on the other hand another power beyond our natural one is added to us, then by that power received by us in excess of and beyond nature, we shall be able to stand before any strange thing which comes upon us supernaturally.</p>

<p>32. For, lo! The power of our ears and eyes is in us and is formed in us in its natural manner; and yet our sight and hearing cannot stand before mighty thunder and lightning; first, because they come with vehemence; and secondly, because their potency suddenly surprises and astounds our feebleness. This is what happened to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. For the potency of the light suddenly surprised his feeble eyes and injured them. But the greatness of the voice brought low his strength and entered his ears and opened them. For they had been closed up by Jewish contentiousness as by wax. For the voice did not plough up the ears, as the light injured the eyeballs. Why? But because it was meet that he should hear, but not that he should see. Therefore the doors of hearing were opened by the voice as by a key: but the doors of sight were shut by the light that should open them. Why then was it meet that he should hear? Clearly because by that voice our Lord was able to reveal Himself as being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by Saul. For He was not able to show Himself by sight as being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>; for there was no way whereby this should be, that the son of David should be seen fleeing and Saul pursuing after Him.  For this happened in very deed with that first Saul and with the first David. The one was pursuing; the other was being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>; they both of them saw and were seen, each by the other. But here the ear alone could hear of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the Son of David; the eye could not see that He was being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. For it was in [the person of] others He was being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, while He was Himself in heaven;&mdash; He Who beforetime had been <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> in His own person while He was upon earth. Therefore the ears [of Saul] were opened and his eyes were closed. And He Who by sight could not represent Himself before Saul as <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, represented Himself by word before him as <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>; when he cried and said&mdash; <em>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?</em> Accordingly, his eyes were closed, because they could not see the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Christ; but his ears were opened, because they could hear of His <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. So then although the eyes of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> were bodily eyes, as those of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, yet his inward eyes were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; for <em><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote of Me</em>, <span class="stiki" id="note370593"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John&nbsp;5:46</a></span> but the outward eyes of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> were open, while the inward [eyes] were shut. Then because the inward eyes of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> shone clear, his outward eyes also were made to shine clearly. But the outward eyes of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> were closed, that by the closing of those that were outward, there might come to pass the opening of those that were inward. For he who by the outward eyes was not able to see the Lord in His signs, he when those bodily eyes were closed, saw with those within. And because he had received the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> in his own person, he wrote to those who had their bodily eyes full of light&mdash; <em>May He illumine the eyes of your hearts</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370594"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse18">Ephesians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> Therefore the signs manifested to the external eyes of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, profited them not at all; but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the heart opened the eyes of the heart of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. But because, had <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> come down in his accustomed aspect from the mountain, without that shining of countenance, and said, <q>I saw there the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> the faithless fathers would not have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him; so also, had <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, without suffering blindness of his eyes, said, <q>I heard the voice of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> the sons who crucified Christ would not have received it as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Therefore He set on <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> as in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, an excelling sign of splendour, that the deceivers might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he had seen the Divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but on Saul, as on a persecutor, He set the hateful sign of blindness, that the liars might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he had heard the words of Christ; that so you might not again speak against <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and that these might not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. For God set signs on the bodies of the blind, and sent them to those who were in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, who used to make signs upon the borders of their garments. But they remembered not the signs on their garments, and in the signs of the body they greatly erred. The fathers who saw the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, did not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; nor did the sons who saw the blindness of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. But three times in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> they threatened to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and his house with stones as dogs.  For <em>all congregation bade stone them with stones</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370596"><a href="../bible/num014.htm#verse10">Numbers&nbsp;14:10</a></span> And thrice they scourged <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> with rods as a dog on his body. [?]  Thrice was I beaten with rods. <span class="stiki" id="note370598"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse25">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:25</a></span> These are the lions who through their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for their Lord were beaten as dogs and were torn as flocks of sheep, those flocks that used to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> their guardian shepherds, in order that ravening wolves might rule over them.</p>

<p>33. But the crucifiers who corrupted the soldiers with a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a>, they perhaps said concerning <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>&mdash;<q>The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> have <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a> him with a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a>; therefore he associates with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>.</q> For those who by the giving of a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> strove that the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a> might not be preached, <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> with the name of a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a>, that his revelation might not be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Therefore the voice astonished him, and the light blinded him, that his astonishment might pacify his <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and his blindness might put to shame his slanderers. For the voice astounded his hearing in this, that it said meekly to him&mdash;(<em>Saul, why do you <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> Me?</em>): and the light blinded his sight, that when the slanderers should have said that he had received a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a>, and thereby was suborned to lie, his blindness which had been brought about by that light might confute them, showing that it was through it that he had been driven to speak what was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. So that those who supposed that his hands had received a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a>, and that because of it his lips lied, might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his eyes had given up their light and because of this his lips proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But again for another reason the meek voice accompanied the overpowering light; namely, that as it were from meekness unto exaltation our Lord might produce help for the persecutor; in like manner as also all His helps were produced, from lowliness unto greatness. For our Lord's meekness continued from the womb to the tomb. And observe that greatness comes close upon His lowliness, and exaltation on His meekness. For whereas His greatness was observed in various things, His Divinity was revealed by <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> signs; that it might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the One Who stood among them, was not one but two. For His nature is not <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> nature alone, nor is it an exalted nature alone; but there are two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> that are mingled, the one with the other; the exalted and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore these two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> show forth their qualities; so that by the quality of each of the two, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> might distinguish between the two; that it might not be supposed that He was merely one&mdash;He Who was two by commingling: but that it might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that He was two in respect of the blending, though He was one in respect of His Being. These things our Lord, through His humility and exaltation, taught to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also in the way to Damascus.</p>

<p>34. For our Lord appeared to Saul in meekness, since meekness was close to His greatness; that because of His greatness it might be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Who He is Who spoke meekly. For even as His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> preached on earth of our Lord in meekness and in exaltation&mdash;in the meekness of His <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, and in the exaltation of His signs,&mdash; so also our Lord preached of Himself in meekness and in exaltation in <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> presence&mdash; in the exaltation of the potency of the light which flashed, and in the meekness of that meek voice which said; <em>Saul, why do you persecute Me?</em>&mdash; so that the preaching of Him which His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> preached concerning Him in presence of many, should be like to that preaching which He preached concerning Himself. But even as, if He had not spoken meekly, it would not have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> there that He was meek, so, had He not appeared there as an overpowering light, it would not have been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> there that He was exalted.</p>

<p>35. And if you should say; <q>What necessity was there that He should speak humbly? Could He not have convinced him also through the greatness of the light?</q> Know, you that questionest, that this rejoinder may be returned to you; that because it was necessary that He should speak humbly, He therefore spoke humbly. For by Him Who is wise in all things, there was done there nothing that was not meet to be done. For He Who has given <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to artificers to do each thing severally with the instrument meet for it, does He not Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which He gives others the power of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>? Therefore whatsoever has been wrought or is being wrought by the Godhead, that very thing that is wrought by Him at that time, is for the furtherance of [God's] working at that time, even though to the blind the Divine orderings seem contrariwise. But that we may not restrain by constraint of words a wise enquirer, one that wishes to grow by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> persuasion as the seed by the rain-drops; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, O enquirer, that because Saul was a persecutor, but our Lord was endeavouring to make him <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> instead of persecutor, therefore He of His wisdom made haste to cry&mdash; <em>Saul, why do you persecute Me?</em>&mdash; in order that, when Saul who was being made a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, heard Him Who was making  him a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, saying, <em>Why do you persecute Me?</em> he might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Master Whose servant he was becoming, was a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Master, and so might quickly cast away the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of his former masters, and might clothe himself in the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> state of his <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Master. Now any master who wishes to teach a man anything, teaches him either by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> or by words. But if he teach him neither by words nor by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, the man cannot be instructed in his craft. So that, even though our Lord did not teach <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> humility by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, yet by voice He taught him endurance of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which He could not teach him by deed. For before our Lord was crucified, He taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> endurance of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> by deed. But after He had finished His <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> by crucifixion, as He said, <em>Lo! All things are finished</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370599"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;19:30</a></span> He could not vainly return and begin again anything which once for all had been wisely finished. Or why again do you seek for the crucifixion and shame of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>?</p>

<p>36. For even though our Lord in His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> had beforetime brought the majesty of His Godhead into humility, yet afterwards in His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> He willed not again to bring back to humiliation the littleness of manhood which had been made great. But because it was necessary that the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> should learn endurance of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, while yet it was impossible that the Master should again come down and be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> afresh; He taught him by voice that which could not be taught by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. <em>Saul, why do you persecute Me?</em> The explanation of which utterance is this&mdash;<q>Saul, why are you not <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> in Me?</q> But in order that Saul might not suppose that it was because of His weakness our Lord was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, the strength of the overpowering light which shone upon him, convinced him. For if the eyes of Saul could not endure the shining of that light, how could the hands of Saul bind and fetter the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord of that light? But his hands had fettered the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that he might learn their power in their bonds; while his eyes could not endure the beams, that by their strength he might learn his own weakness. But had not the power of that light shone upon him, when the Lord said to him; <em>Saul, why do you persecute Me?</em> Then because of the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> wherein <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was set up at that time, he would perhaps have said this to Him, <q>I am <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> You for this reason, because You have said, <em>Why do you persecute Me? </em> For who is there that would not <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> You, when You, with such strength, troublest Your persecutor with these feeble cries.</q> But the humility of our Lord was heard in the voice, and the power of the light shone forth in the beams. So <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> could not despise the humility of the voice, because of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the light.</p>

<p>37. Thus were his ears brought into discipleship to the voice which he heard, because his eyes sufficed not to endure the beams which they saw. That marvel of the dawning of the light was shed forth upon his eyeballs and did them hurt; and the voice of the Lord of the light entered his ears, but did them no harm. But between the light and the Lord of the light, which ought to have been the stronger? For if the light which was created by Him was so overpowering, how much more overpowering He by Whom this very light was created! But if the Lord of the light was overpowering, as indeed He is overpowering, how did His voice enter the hearing and not harm it? Even as that light which hurt the sight? But hear the wonder and the marvel which our Lord wrought by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For our Lord willed not to <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> that light which is His; but He being Lord of the light humbled Himself. But as the Lord of the light is greater than the light which is His, so great is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that the Lord of the light should <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> Himself rather than <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> the light.</p>

<p>38. As also in the night, while He was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, it is written&mdash; <em>There appeared to</em>  <em>Him an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> strengthening Him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370600"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;22:43</a></span> But here all mouths, celestial and terrestrial, are insufficient to give thanks to Him by Whose hand the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were created; that He was strengthened for the sake of sinners by that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who was created by His hand. As then the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from above stood in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and in brightness, while the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, that He might <em>exalt</em> man who was degraded, stood in degradation and humility; so also here that light flashed forth in manifestation; but the Lord of the light, for the sake of helping one persecutor, spoke with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> voice and lowly words.</p>

<p>39. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> therefore that light which was overpowering, because it was not diminished, entered the eyeballs with overpowering manifestation and injured them. But the Lord of the light, because He had lowered Himself in order to help, His lowly voice entered the ears that had need and helped them. But in order that the help of that voice which had become lowly, might not fail Him, therefore the strength of that light was not lowered, in order that because of that light, which was not lowered, the help of that voice which was lowered, might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. But this is a marvel, that until our Lord made Himself lowly in voice, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was not made lowly in deed; for even as, before He came down and clothed Himself in a body, our Lord was in exaltation with His Father; yet in His exaltation men did not learn humility; but when He humbled Himself and came down from His exaltation, then by His humbleness humility was soon among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; so again after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> and ascension He was in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> at the right hand of God His Father, but by that His exaltation, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did not learn humility. Therefore He that was exalted and sat at the right hand of His Father, ceased from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and lofty speech, and He cried as one wronged and oppressed, with feeble and meek words, saying&mdash; <em>Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me? </em> Thus, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> words prevailed over harsh bridles. For by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> words, as by bridles, the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> led the persecutor from the broad way of the persecutors into the narrow way of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. And since all the signs that were done in the Name of our Lord did not convince <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, our Lord made haste to meet with humility him who was hastening on the way to Damascus in the vehemence of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Thus by His <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> words, the harsh vehemence of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> was checked.</p>

<p>40. He then Who used <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> words with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> His persecutor, He also used <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> sayings with the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>. For so great is the power of humility that even God Who overcomes all did not overcome without it. Humility was able also in the wilderness to bear the burden of the stiff-necked people. For against the people who were more stubborn than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, was set <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> who was more meek than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. For God Who needs not anything, when He had set free the people, afterwards had need of the humility of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that this humility might endure the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and murmuring of the People that provoked him. For humility alone could endure the gainsayings of that people, which the signs of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the prodigies (wrought) in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> could not subdue. For when <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> had wrought divisions among the people, humility by its <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> used to close up their divisions. If then the humility of the Stammerer endured six hundred thousand, how much more exceedingly did the humility of Him, Who gave speech to the Stammerer endure? For the humility of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is a shadow of the humility of our Lord.</p>

<p>41. Our Lord then saw that Simon the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the signs and wonders which he had seen. He came to him to persuade him with <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> words; and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> utterances overcame him, whom mighty wonders had not overcome. What then are the wonders which that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> had seen? He had seen the dead raised to life, the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> cleansed, the blind with eyes opened. These signs compelled that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> to entertain our Lord as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. But he who entertained Him as a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, changed so as to despise Him for one who had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, saying (namely);&mdash; <em>Had this man been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, He would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></em>&mdash; who had approached Him&mdash; <em>is a sinner</em>. But we may despise the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> and say, Had he been a man of discernment,  he would have learned from that sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who approached our Lord, not that He was a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, but the Lord of the Prophets. For the tears of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> testified, that it was not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> they were propitiating, but Him, Who, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For, because the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> sufficed not to raise sinners to life, the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> came down to heal those who were in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> case. But what physician is there who hinders the smitten, that they should not come to him, O blind <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, as it befell that she came to our Physician! For why did the smitten <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> approach Him&mdash;she, whose wounds were healed by her tears? He Who had come down to be a fountain of healing among the diseased, was proclaiming this&mdash; <em>Let every one that is thirsty, come and drink</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370602"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37</a></span> But when the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, this man's companions, murmured at the healing of sinners, the Physician taught concerning His art, that the door is opened for the diseased and not for the whole, for <em>they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370603"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12</a></span> Therefore the praise of the physician is the healing of the diseased&mdash;that the shame of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> who reproved the praise of our physician may be greater. But our Lord used to show signs in the streets; and also when He entered into the house of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, He showed signs which were greater than those He had shown outside. For in the street He made whole the bodies that were sick, but within He healed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> that were diseased. Outside, He raised to life the mortality of Lazarus: but within, He raised to life the mortality of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. He restored the living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the corpse from which it had gone out; and He expelled from the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> the deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which dwelt within her. But the blind (<a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>) who was insufficient for great things, because of the great things which he saw not, belied those small things which he had seen. For he was a son of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> who attributed weakness to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not to himself. For (<a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> said), <em>Though He smote the rock and the waters flowed, can He also give us bread</em>?  But when our Lord saw his weakness, that it missed the great things and, because of them, the small things also, He hasted to put forward a simple word, as though for a babe that was being reared on milk, and was not capable of solid food.</p>

<p>42. For by that wherein you knew, O <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, that our Lord was not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, by that very thing it was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that you did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For by this that you said&mdash; <em>Had this man been a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, he would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a></em>, you show herein that (in your esteem) whoever is a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all things. But lo! some matters were hidden from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; how then do you attribute the revelation of all hidden things to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? But this unwise teacher who perverted the scriptures of the Prophets, did not even understand what he read in the scriptures. For it was not only that the greatness of the Lord was not discerned by that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, but he did not even discern the weakness of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For our Lord, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> all things, allowed that sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to come in and receive His peace. But Elisha, as one <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, said to the Shunamite;&mdash; Peace to you <em>and peace be to the child</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370605"><a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse26">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:26</a></span> Accordingly he who supposed that our Lord was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, was himself <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Prophets. When the mind contains <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and cannot refrain, then that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> which is in it, is cunning in finding a pretext for opening a door; but in case that pretext, in which the deceiver takes refuge is confuted, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that within this there is another concealed which he may employ.</p>

<p>Now observe this son of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, how he was like <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> in stubbornness. For <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> was bound up in the mind of the People; therefore <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was taken away from them, that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> that was within them might become manifest. But that they might not be put to shame, and that it might not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> how they were seeking <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, they first sought for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and then for <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. <em>As for this <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what has become of him</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370606"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;32:1</a></span> And if <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who cannot die, brought you out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, why do you seek for a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, who at some time must die? Yet they did not desire <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, that he should become a god to them; because <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> could hear and see and reprove; but they sought for a god who could neither hear nor see nor reprove. But whenever <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> shall have died, what shall remain of him? For behold, your God is a living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and lo! He has revealed Himself to you by living testimonies. For the bright cloud was at that time overshadowing them, and they had the pillar of light in the night-time. Water flowed for them from the rock, and they drank its streams. They were delighted every day by tasting that manna, the fame of which we have heard. How was <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> far from you? Behold the signs of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> surround you. Or how does the person of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> profit you, when you have such a guide as this? If your garments wear not old, and a temperate air refreshes you, if the heat and the cold do not hurt you, and you have rest from <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and art far removed from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>&mdash;what thing then was lacking to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> that he sought for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? Open <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> was lacking to him. For it was not for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> that he sought, but on the pretext of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> absence he followed after the calf. Thus briefly have we showed, that when the mind is full of anything, but an opposing reason meets it, then it forces it by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to open for it a door to that which it desires.</p>

<p>43. You too, O <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, thirsty for <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, what did you see in our Lord, to show that He was not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? For lo! The things that belong to the Lord of the Prophets were seen in Him. For the gushing tears made haste to proclaim that they were shed as before God. The sorrowing kisses testified that they sought to win over the creditor to tear up the debt-bonds. The goodly ointment of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> proclaimed that it was a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> of penitence. These medicines the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> offered to her Physician, that by her tears He might wash away her stains, by her kisses He might heal her wounds, by her sweet ointment He might make her <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> name sweet as the odour of her ointment. This is the Physician who heals men by the medicines which they bring to Him. These marvels were shown at that time; but to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> instead of these there appeared <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. For what could be established in the weeping of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but that He can justify sinners? Else, judge in your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, O blind teacher, why was that mournful weeping in the joyful feast, so that, while they were making merry with food, she was in bitterness with her tears? Because she was a sinner, her <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> were unchaste, and these (<a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>) she was wont to do. But if at that time, from the wantonness of sinners she was turned to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, then acknowledge, you who said <em>He is not a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a></em>, that He is One who makes those chaste that have been wanton. For by this, that you know that she is a sinner, and by this, that you see her now penitent, search out where is the power that changed her. For he ought to have fallen down and worshipped Him Who, while silent, in His silence turned to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> those sinners whom the Prophets by their vehement utterances could not turn to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. A wonderful and marvellous thing was seen in the house of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>; a sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that sat and wept, and she who wept said not wherefore she wept; nor did He at Whose feet she sat say to her, Why do you weep? The sinner did not need with her lips to petition our Lord, because she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the petitions that were hidden in her tears. Nor did our Lord ask her, What have you done? For He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that by her pure kisses she was atoning for her transgressions. So then she, because she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the things that were hidden, offered to Him her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in her heart; for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> secret things He had no need of the outward lips. If then the sinner, because she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that our Lord was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sought not to persuade Him with her lips; and our Lord, because as God He discerned her thoughts, therefore questioned her not; do you not, O tyrant <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, from the silence of both understand the position of both; that she was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> as to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in her heart, and that He as God was in silence searching out her thoughts? But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> could not see and understand these things, because he was a son of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> who though perceiving, saw not, and though he heard, understood not. Though then our Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> thought <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts concerning Him, He confuted him gently and not harshly. For sweetness came down from on high to break down the bitterness with which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> had stamped us. Therefore our Lord taught that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> of Himself and in Himself, as though saying, Even as I, though I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things in your heart, yet gently persuaded you, so though I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things of this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, I mercifully received her.</p>

<p>But let us hear how long-suffering was drawn after the hasty thought, so as to draw it from haste to understanding. <em>A certain creditor had two debtors. One owed five hundred dinars, and the other fifty dinars</em>.&mdash; (Be not wearied, O hearer, at the length of the repetition of the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, lest you be contrary to Him Who in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> was long-suffering for the sake of giving help.)&mdash; <em>At length, when neither of them had wherewithal to pay, he forgave them both. Which of them do you think would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him more? Simon said to Him, I suppose that he, to whom more was forgiven. Our Lord said to him, You have rightly judged.</em> Our Lord in His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> commended the perverse (<a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>), because of the right judgment, which he had judged, though he in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> had answered the good Lord concerning the mercy He had wrought. Now many things are laid up in this <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>; for it is a treasury full of many helps. Why then did our Lord require that the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> should pass judgment for Him between the two debtors? Was it not that the greatness, coming after the littleness, might show itself that nothing of the littleness was drawn after the greatness? For our Lord, since He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the secret things, was long-suffering and questioned Simon, that those might be put to shame who, though not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, were hasty to blame, but not to enquire. For if, O man, before I heard your judgment passed, I judged not of it, why did you, before you heard from Me, the case of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, hastily blame? Now this was done for our instruction, that we might be swift to enquire, but slow to pass our sentence. For had that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> been long-suffering, lo! That pardon which our Lord in the end gave to the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, would have taught him everything. Long-suffering is wont to acquire all things for those that acquire it.</p>

<p>44. But again; through the forgiveness of the two debtors, our Lord led into forgiveness him who was in need of forgiveness, yet in whose eyes the forgiveness of debts was hateful. For though the debts of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> himself needed forgiveness, yet the forgiveness of the debts of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was hateful in his eyes. For had there been this forgiveness of debts in the mind of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, it would not have been in his eyes disgraceful that that sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should have come for forgiveness of her debts to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and not to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> could not forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> such as those. But this sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> works which our Lord did, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that He could also forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that whoso is able to restore the members of the body, is able also to cleanse away the spots of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, though he was a teacher, did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this. For the teachers of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were wont to be fools, put to shame by the despised and vile. For they were put to shame by that blind man to whom they said&mdash; <em>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this man is a sinner</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370607"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;9:24-31</a></span> But he said to them:&mdash; <em>How did He open my eyes? Lo! God hears not sinners</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370608"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;9:24-31</a></span> These are the blind teachers who were made guides to others; and their perverse path was made straight by a blind man.</p>

<p>45. But hear the marvel that our Lord wrought. Because that <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> supposed that our Lord did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who touched Him was a sinner; our Lord made the lips of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> like the strings of a harp; and by his very lips He sang how she was trampling under foot his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not. And he who as though he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> had blamed, was found to be a harp, whereto another could sing of that which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>. For our Lord compared the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to five hundred dinars, and caused them to pass into the hearing of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> which he heard; and again brought them forth from his mouth in the judgment he gave; though Simon <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, when he was judging, that those five hundred dinars denoted the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. And (the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>) who thought concerning our Lord that He had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, was himself found not to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them, when he heard of those debts in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a>, and gave judgment concerning them with his voice. But when it was explained to him at last by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that alike his ears and also his lips were, as it were, instruments for our Lord, through which He might sing the glories of His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<p>For this <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> was the fellow of those <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>, whose sentence by their own mouths our Lord gave against them&mdash; <em>What then will the Lord of the vineyard do to those husbandmen</em>? <span class="stiki" id="note370609"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;21:40-44</a></span> They say unto Him, against themselves:&mdash; <em>He will terribly destroy them, and will hire out the vineyard to husbandmen who will render unto Him the fruit in its season</em>. This is the Godhead to which all things are easy, which by the mouths, the very mouths that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> it, pronounced the sentence of those very mouths against them.</p>

<p>46. Glory then be to Him the Invisible, who clothed Himself in invisibility, that sinners might he able to draw near to Him. For our Lord did not repel the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> as the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> expected; inasmuch as He descended from the height which no man can reach unto, altogether in order that lowly <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, like Zaccheus, might reach unto Him. And the Nature which none can handle, clothed Itself in a body, altogether in order that all lips <span class="stiki" id="note370610"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;6:7</a></span> might <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> His feet as the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> did. For the sacred <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was hidden within the veil of flesh, and so touched all unclean lips and sanctified them. Thus He Whom His appetite was supposed to invite to feasting, His feet invited to tears; He was the good Physician, who came forth to go to the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was seeking Him in her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. She then anointed the feet of our Lord, who (anointed) not His head&mdash;she who was trodden down in the dust by all. For those <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> who justified themselves and despised all (else), trod her down. But He the Merciful, Whose pure body sanctified her uncleanness, had pity on her.</p>

<p>47. But Mary anointed the head of our Lord's body, <span class="stiki" id="note370611"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;26:7</a></span> as a token of the better part which she had chosen. And Christ prophesied concerning that which her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> had chosen. While Martha was cumbered with serving, Mary was hungering to be satisfied with spiritual things by Him Who also satisfies us with bodily things. So Mary refreshed Him with precious ointment, as He had refreshed her with His exalted teaching. Mary by the oil showed forth the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His mortality, Who by His teaching mortified the concupiscence of her flesh. Thus the sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> by the flood of her tears, in full assurance was rewarded with remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from beside His feet; and she who had the issue of blood, stole healing from the hem of His garment. But Mary received blessing openly from His mouth, as a reward of the service of her hands upon His head. For she poured out on His head the precious ointment, and received from His mouth a wonderful promise. This is the ointment which was sown above and yielded fruit below. For she sowed it on His head and gathered its fruit from between His lips&mdash; <em>She shall have a name and this memorial in every place where My <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> shall be preached</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370612"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;26:13</a></span> Accordingly, what she then received of Him, He is able to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to pass unto all generations: and in no generation can any hinder it. For the ointment which she poured upon His head, gave its odour in presence of all the guests and refreshed Him; so also the goodly name which He gave her, passes down through all generations and brings <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to her. Even as all who were at the feast were sensible of her ointment; it was meet that all who come into the world should be sensible of her triumph. This is a loan whereof the increase is exacted in all generations.</p>

<p>48. Now Simeon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, when he took Him up in his arms to present Him before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note370613"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;2:28</a></span> understood as he saw [Him] that He was not presenting Him, but was being himself presented. For the Son was not presented by the servant to His Father, but the servant was presented by the Son to his Lord. For it is not possible that He, by Whom every offering is presented, should be presented by another. For the offering does not present him that offers it; but by them that offer are offerings presented. So then He Who receives offerings gave Himself to be offered by another, that those who presented Him, while offering Him, might themselves be presented by Him. For as He gave His body to be eaten, that when eaten It might quicken to life them that ate Him; so He gave Himself to be offered, that by His Cross the hands of them that offered Him might be sanctified. So, then, though the arms of Simeon seemed to be presenting the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, yet the words of Simeon testified that he was presented by the Son. Therefore we can have no dispute concerning this, because that which was said put an end to dispute&mdash; <em>Now let Your servant depart in peace</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370614"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;2:29</a></span> He then who is let depart to go in peace to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is presented as an offering to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And in order to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by whom he was presented, he said&mdash; <em>For lo! My eyes have seen Your mercy</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370615"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;2:30</a></span> If there was no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> wrought on him, why then did he give thanks? But rightly did he give thanks, that he was thought worthy to receive in his arms Him, Whom <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> greatly desired to see. For lo! <em>my eyes have seen Your mercy</em>. Let us understand then and see. Is <em>mercy</em> that which shows mercy to another, or is it that which receives mercy from another? But if mercy is that which shows mercy to all, well did Simeon call our Lord by the name of the mercy that showed mercy to him&mdash;Him Who freed him from the world which is full of snares, that he might go to <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a> which is full of pleasures; for he who was <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> said and testified that he was offered as an offering, that from the midst of the perishing world he should go and be stored up in the treasure-house which is kept safe. For one for whom it may be that what he has found should be lost, to him it belongs to be diligent that it should be kept safe. But for our Lord it could not be that He should be lost; but by Him the lost were found. So then, through the Son Who could not be lost, the servant who was very desirous not to be lost, was presented. <em>Lo! My eyes have seen Your mercy</em>. It is evident Simeon received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from that Child Whom he was carrying. For inwardly he received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from that Infant, Whom openly he received in his arms. For through Him Who was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>, even when He was carried, being small and feeble, he that carried Him was made great.</p>

<p>49. But inasmuch as Simeon endured to carry on his weak arms that Majesty which the creatures could not endure, it is evident that his weakness was made strong by the strength which he carried. For at that time Simeon also along with all creatures was secretly upheld by the almighty strength of the Son. Now this is a marvel, that outwardly it was he that was strengthened that carried Him Who strengthened him; but inwardly it was the strength that bore its bearer. For the Majesty straitened itself, that they who carried it might endure it; in order that as far as that Majesty stooped to our littleness, so far should our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> be raised up from all desires to reach that Majesty.</p>

<p>50. So likewise the ship that carried our Lord; it was He that bare it, in that He stayed from it the wind that would have sunk it. Peace, for you are shut up. While He was on the sea, His arm reached even to the fountain of the wind, <span class="stiki" id="note370616"><a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse39">Mark&nbsp;4:39</a></span> to shut it up. The ship bare His manhood, but the power of His Godhead bare the ship and all that was therein. But that He might show that even His manhood needed not the ship, instead of the planks which a shipwright puts together and fastens, He like the Architect of creation, made the waters solid and joined them together and laid them under His feet. So the Lord strengthened the hands of Simeon the Priest, that his arms might bear up in the Temple the strength that was bearing up all; as He strengthened the feet of Simeon the Apostle, that they might bear themselves up on the water. And so that name which bore the first-begotten in the Temple was afterwards borne up by the first-begotten in the sea; that He might show that as in the sea the drowning was borne up by Him, He did not need to be borne by Simeon on the dry ground. But our Lord bare Simeon up openly in the midst of the sea to teach that also on the dry land He supported him secretly.</p>

<p>51. Accordingly, the Son came to the servant; not that the Son might be presented by the servant, but that by the Son the servant might present to His Lord Priesthood and Prophecy, to be laid up with Him. For <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, which were given through <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, were handed down, both of them, and reached to Simeon. For he was a pure vessel, who sanctified himself that he might be like <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, capable for both of them. There are small vessels which are capable for great gifts. There are gifts for which one is capable, by reason of their <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; yet many are not capable for them, by reason of their greatness. Thus, then, Simeon presented our Lord, and in Him offered both these things; so that that which was given to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the wilderness, was received from Simeon in the Temple. But seeing that our Lord is the vessel wherein all fullness dwells, when Simeon was offering Him before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he poured over Him (as a drink-offering) those two (gifts), <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from His hands and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> from His lips. Priesthood continued on the hands of Simeon, because of his purifications; and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> dwelt in operation upon his lips, because of revelations. When then these two powers saw Him who was Lord of both, they two united together and poured themselves into the vessel that was capable of both; that could contain <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and kingdom and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>. That Infant then, who was wrapped in swaddling clothes, because of His graciousness, clothed Himself in <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> because of His Majesty. For Simeon clothed Him in these, and gave Him to her who had wrapped Him in swaddling clothes. For when he gave Him to His mother, he gave along with Him the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; and when he prophesied to her concerning Him, <em>This (child) is set for the fall and rising again</em>, <span class="stiki" id="note370617"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;2:34</a></span> he gave <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> also with Him.</p>

<p>52. Then Mary received her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> and went forth. He was outwardly wrapped in swaddling clothes, but secretly He was clothed with <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. Whatsoever then was handed down from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, was received from Simeon, but continued and was possessed by the Lord of both. So then the steward first, and the treasurer lastly, handed over the keys of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> to Him who has authority over the treasurer of them both. Therefore, His Father gave Him the spirit not by measure, <span class="stiki" id="note370618"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;3:34</a></span> because all measures of the spirit are under his hand. And that our Lord might show that He received the keys from the former stewards, He said to Simeon: <em>To you I will give the keys of the doors</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note370619"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;16:19</a></span> But how should He have given them to another, had He not received them from another? So, then, the keys which He had received from Simeon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, them He gave to another Simeon the Apostle; that even though the People had not hearkened to the former Simeon, the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> might hearken to the latter Simeon.</p>

<p>53. But because John also was the treasurer of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the Lord of the stewardship came to him to receive from him the keys of the house of reconciliation. For John used to wash away in common water the blemishes of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; that bodies might become meet for the garment of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, given by our Lord. Therefore, because the Spirit was with the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He came to John to receive from him <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that He might mingle with the visible waters the invisible Spirit; that they whose bodies should feel the moistening of the water, their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> should feel the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; that even as the bodies outwardly feel the pouring of the water upon them, so the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> inwardly may feel the pouring of the Spirit upon them. Accordingly, even us our Lord when He was baptised, was clothed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and carried <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> with Him, so also when He was presented in the Temple, He put on <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and went forth bearing the purity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> upon His pure members, and bearing the words of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> in His wondrous ears. For when Simeon was sanctifying the body of the Child who sanctifies all, that body received the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> in its sanctification. And again, when Simeon was prophesying over Him, <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> quickly entered the hearing of the Child. For if John leaped in the womb and perceived the voice of the Mother of our Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note370620"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;1:41</a></span> how much more should our Lord have heard in the Temple? For lo! It was because of Him that John <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> (so as) to hear in the womb.</p>

<p>54. Accordingly, each one of the gifts that was stored up for the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He gathered from their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> tree. For He received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from the Jordan, even though John still after Him used to baptise. And He received <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> from the Temple, even though <a href="../cathen/01536a.htm">Annas the High Priest</a> exercised it. And again, He received <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which had been handed down among the righteous, even though by it <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a> in mockery platted a crown for our Lord, and He received the kingdom from the house of David, even though <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> held the place and exercised it.</p>

<p>55. This is He Who flew and came down from on high; and when all those gifts which He had given to those of old time saw Him, they came flying from every quarter and rested on Him their Giver. For they gathered themselves together from every side, to come and be grafted into their natural tree. For they had been grafted into bitter trees, namely into <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> kings and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Therefore they hastened to come to their sweet parent-stock; namely to the Godhead Who in sufficiency came down to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that the parts of Him might be gathered to Him. And when He received of them that which was His own, that which was not His own was rejected; since for the sake of His own He had borne also with that which was not His own. For He bore with the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, for the sake of His <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; and He bore with its <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, for the sake of His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and He bore with its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> dominion, for the sake of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> crown.</p>

<p>56. But when our Lord took to Himself Priesthood from them, He sanctified by it all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. And again, when He took to Himself <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, He revealed by it His counsels to all nations. And when he wove His crown, He bound the strong One who takes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> captive, and divides his spoils. These gifts were barren, with the fig-tree, which while it was barren of fruit made barren such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> powers as these. Therefore as being without fruit, it was cut off, that these gifts might pass forth from it and bring forth fruit abundantly among all the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>57. So He, Who came to make our bodies abodes for His indwelling, passed by all those dwelling-places. Let each one of us then be a dwelling-place for Him Who loves me. Let us come to Him and make our abode with Him. This is the Godhead Whom though all creation cannot contain, yet a lowly and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffices to receive Him.</p>
