<h1>Homily on St. Ignatius</h1>

<p><strong>Eulogy. On the holy martyr Saint Ignatius, the god-bearer,  arch-bishop of Antioch the great, who was carried off to Rome, and there suffered martyrdom, and thence was conveyed back again to Antioch.</strong></p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Sumptuous</span> and splendid entertainers give frequent and constant entertainments, alike to display their own <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and to show good-will to their acquaintance. So also the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, affording us a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his own power, and displaying much good-will towards the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sets before us successively and constantly the tables of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Lately, for instance, a maiden quite young, and unmarried, the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Pelagia, entertained us, with much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Today again, this blessed and noble <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> has succeeded to her feast. The <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are different: The table is one. The wrestlings are varied: The crown is one. The contests are manifold: The prize is the same. For in the case of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> contests, since the tasks are bodily, men alone are, with reason, admitted. But here, since the contest is wholly concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the lists are open to each sex, for each kind the theatre is arranged. Neither do men alone disrobe, in order that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> may not take refuge in the weakness of their nature, and seem to have a plausible excuse, nor have <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> only quitted themselves like men, lest the race of men be put to shame; but on this side and on that many are proclaimed conquerors, and are crowned, in order that you may learn by means of the exploits themselves that in Christ Jesus neither male nor female, <span class="stiki" id="note190367"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians&nbsp;3:28</a></span> neither sex, nor weakness of body, nor age, nor any such thing could be a hindrance to those who run in the course of religion; if there be a noble readiness, and an eager <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fervent and kindling, be established in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. On this account both maidens and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and men, both young and old, and slaves, and freemen, and every rank, and every age, and each sex, disrobe for those contests, and in no respect suffer harm, since they have brought a noble purpose to these wrestlings. The season then already calls us to discourse of the mighty works of this saint. But our reckoning is disturbed and confused, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what to say first, what second, what third, so great a multitude of things calling for eulogy surrounds us, on every side; and we experience the same thing as if any one went into a meadow, and seeing many a rosebush and many a violet, and an abundance of lilies, and other spring flowers manifold and varied, should be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> what he should look at first, what second, since each of those he saw invites him to bestow his glances on itself. For we too, coming to this spiritual meadow of the mighty works of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, and beholding not the flowers of spring, but the manifold and varied fruit of the spirit in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of this man, are confused and in perplexity, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> to which we are first to give our consideration, as each of the things we see draws us away from its neighbours, and entices the eye of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the sight of its own beauty. For see, he presided over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> among us nobly, and with such carefulness as Christ desires. For that which Christ declared to be the highest standard and rule of the Episcopal office, did this man display by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. For having heard Christ saying, the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep, <span class="stiki" id="note190368"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;10:11</a></span> with all <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> he did lay it down for the sheep.</p>

<p>He held <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> converse with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and drank of spiritual fountains. What kind of person then is it likely that he was who had been reared, and who had everywhere held converse with them, and had shared with them truths both lawful and unlawful to utter, and who seemed to them worthy of so great a dignity? The time again came on, which demanded <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>; and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which despised all things present, glowed with Divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and valued things unseen before the things which are seen; and he lay aside the flesh with as much ease as one would put off a garment. What then shall we speak of first? The teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> which he gave <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of throughout, or his indifference to this present life, or the strictness of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, with which he administered his rule over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; which shall we first call to mind? The <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or the apostle. For the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the spirit having woven a threefold crown, thus bound it on his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> head, yea rather a manifold crown. For if any one will consider them carefully, he will find each of the crowns, blossoming with other crowns for us.</p>

<p>2. And if you will, let us come first to the praise of his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. Does this seem to be one crown alone? Come, then, let us unfold it in speech, and you will see both two, and three, and more produced from it. For I do not wonder at the man alone that he seemed to be worthy of so great an office, but that he obtained this office from those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and that the hands of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> touched his sacred head. For not even is this a slight thing to be said in his praise, nor because he won greater <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from above, nor only because they caused more abundant energy of the Spirit to come upon him, but because they bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> possessed by man was in him. Now how this is, I tell you. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writing to Titus once on a time&mdash; and when I say <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, I do not speak of him alone, but also of Peter and James and John, and the whole band of them; for as in one lyre, the strings are different strings, but the harmony is one, so also in the band of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are different, but the teaching is one, since the artificer is one, I mean the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who moves their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> showing this said, <q>Whether therefore they, or I, so we preach.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190369"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:11</a></span> This man, then, writing to Titus, and showing what kind of man the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ought to be, says, <q>For the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be blameless as God's steward; not self-willed, not soon <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, temperate, holding to the faithful word, which is according to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190370"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse7">Titus&nbsp;1:7-9</a></span> and to Timothy again, when writing upon this subject, he says somewhat like this: If a man seeks the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he desires a good work. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, therefore, must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach, no brawler, no striker, but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money. Do you see what strictness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> he demands from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>? For as some most excellent painter from life, having mixed many colors, if he be about to furnish an original likeness of the royal form, works with all accuracy, so that all who are copying it, and painting from it, may have a likeness accurately drawn, so accordingly the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, as though painting some royal likeness, and furnishing an original sketch of it, having mixed the different colors of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, has painted in the features of the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> complete, in order that each of those who mount to that dignity, looking thereupon, may administer their own affairs with just such strictness.</p>

<p>Boldly, therefore, would I say that <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> took an accurate impression of the whole of this, in his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and was blameless and without reproach, and neither self-willed, nor soon <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, nor given to wine, nor a striker, but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money, just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, temperate, holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, sober, sober-minded, orderly, and all the rest which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> demanded. <q>And what is the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of this?</q> says one. They who said these things ordained him, and they who suggest to others with so great strictness to make <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of those who are about to mount to the throne of this office, would not themselves have done this negligently. But had they not seen all this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> planted in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of this <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> would not have entrusted him with this office. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> accurately how great danger besets those who bring about such ordinations, carelessly and hap-hazard. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> again, when showing this very thing to the same Timothy wrote and says, <q>Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190371"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:22</a></span> What do you say? Has another  <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and do I share his blame and his punishment? Yes, says he, the man who authorizes <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and just as in the case of any one entrusting into the hands of a raging and insane person a sharply pointed sword, with which the madman commits <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, that man who gave the sword incurs the blame; so any one who gives the authority which arises from this office to a man living in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, draws down on his own head all the fire of that man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and audacity. For he who provides the root, this man is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all that springs from it on every side. Do you see how in the meanwhile a double crown of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> has appeared, and how the dignity of those who ordained him has made the office more illustrious, bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to every exhibition of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in him?</p>

<p>3. Do you wish that I should also reveal to you another crown springing from this very matter? Let us consider the time at which he obtained this dignity. For it is not the same thing to administer the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> now as then, just as it is not the same thing to travel along a road well trodden, and prepared, after many wayfarers; and along one about to be cut for the first time, and containing ruts, and stones, and full of wild beasts, and which has never yet, received any traveller. For now, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is no danger for <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but deep peace on all sides, and we all enjoy a calm, since the Word of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> has been extended to the ends of the world, and our rulers keep the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with strictness. But then there was nothing of this, but wherever any one might look, precipices and pitfalls, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and fightings, and dangers; both rulers, and kings, and people and cities and nations, and men at home and abroad, laid snares for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. And this was not the only serious thing, but also the fact that many of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> themselves, inasmuch as they tasted for the first time <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">strange doctrines</a>, stood in need of great indulgence, and were still in a somewhat feeble condition and were often upset. And this was a thing which used to grieve the teachers, no less than the fightings without, nay rather much more. For the fightings without, and the plottings, afforded much pleasure to them on account of the hope of the rewards awaiting them. On this account the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> returned from the presence of the Sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been beaten; <span class="stiki" id="note190372"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse41">Acts&nbsp;5:41</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> cries out, saying: <q>I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in my sufferings,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190373"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse24">Colossians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> and he glories in his afflictions everywhere. But the wounds of those at home, and the falls of the brethren, do not suffer them to breathe again, but always, like some most heavy yoke, continually oppress and afflict the neck of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Hear at least how <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, thus rejoicing in sufferings, is bitterly pained about these. <q>For who, says he, is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190374"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> and again, <q>I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest when I come I shall find you not such as I would, and I be found of you such as you would not,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190375"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:20</a></span> and a little afterwards, <q>Lest when I come again to you, God <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> me, and I shall mourn many of those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> before, and have not repented of their uncleanness, and wantonness, and fornication which they have committed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190376"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:21</a></span> And throughout you see that he is in tears and lamentations on account of members of the household, and evermore fearing and trembling for the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. Just as then we admire the pilot, not when he is able to bring those who are on board safe to shore when the sea is calm, and the ship is borne along by favourable winds, but when the deep is raging and the waves contending, and the passengers themselves within in revolt, and a great storm within and without besets those who are on board, and he is able to steer the ship with all security; so we ought to wonder at, and admire those who then had the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> committed to their hands, much more than those who now have the management of it; when there was a great <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> without and within, when the plant of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was more tender, and needed much care, when, as a newly-born babe, the multitude in the church required much forethought, and the greatest wisdom in any <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> destined to nurse it; and in order that you may more clearly learn, how great crowns they were worthy of, who then had the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> entrusted to them, and how great work and danger there was in undertaking the matter on the threshold and at the beginning, and in being the first to enter upon it, I bring forward for you the testimony of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who pronounces a verdict on these things, and confirms the opinion which has been expressed by me. For when he saw many coming to him, and was wishing to show the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> toiled more than they, he says: <q>Others have laboured, and you have entered into their labour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190377"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;4:38</a></span> And yet the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> toiled much more than the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. But since they first sowed the word of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and won over the untaught <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the greater part of the work is credited to them. For it is by no means the same thing for one to come and teach after many teachers, and himself to be the first to sow seeds. For that which has been already practised, and has become customary with many, would be easily accepted; but that which is now for the first time heard, agitates the mind of the hearers, and gives the teacher a great deal to do. This at least it was which disturbed the audience at Athens, and on this account they turned away from <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, reproaching him with, <q>You bring certain strange things to our ears.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190378"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse20">Acts&nbsp;17:20</a></span> For if the oversight of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> now furnishes much weariness and work to those who govern it, consider how double and treble and manifold was the work then, when there were dangers and fighting and snares, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> continually. It is not possible to set forth in words the difficulty which those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> then encountered, but he alone will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it who comes to it by experience.</p>

<p>4. And I will speak of a fourth crown, arising for us out of this <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. What then is this? The fact that he was entrusted with our own native city. For it is a laborious thing indeed to have the oversight of a hundred men, and of fifty alone. But to have on one's hands so great a city, and a population extending to two hundred thousand, of how great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and wisdom do you think there is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>? For as in the care of armies, the wiser of the generals have on their hands the more leading and more numerous regiments, so, accordingly, in the care of cities. The more able of the rulers are entrusted with the larger and more populous. And at any rate this city was of much account to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as indeed He manifested by the very <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which He did. At all events the master of the whole world, Peter, to whose hands He committed the keys of heaven, whom He commanded to do and to bear all, He bade tarry here for a long period. Thus in His sight our city was equivalent to the whole world. But since I have mentioned Peter, I have perceived a fifth crown woven from him, and this is that this man succeeded to the office after him. For just as any one taking a great stone from a foundation hastens by all means to introduce an equivalent to it, lest he should shake the whole building, and make it more unsound, so, accordingly, when Peter was about to depart from here, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit introduced another teacher equivalent to Peter, so that the building already completed should not be made more unsound by the insignificance of the successor. We have reckoned up then five crowns, from the importance of the office, from the dignity of those who ordained to it, from the difficulty of the time, from the size of the city, from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of him who transmitted the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> to him. Having woven all these, it was lawful to speak of a sixth, and seventh, and more than these; but in order that we may not, by spending the whole time on the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, miss the details about the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, come from this point, let us pass to that conflict. At one time a grievous warfare was rekindled against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and as though a most grievous tyranny overspread the earth, all were carried off from the midst of the market-place. Not indeed charged with anything monstrous, but because being freed from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, they hastened to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; because they abstained from the service of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, because they recognized the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and worshipped his only begotten Son, and for things for which they ought to have been crowned, and admired and honoured, for these they were punished and encountered countless tortures, all who embraced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and much more they who had the oversight of the churches. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, being crafty, and apt to contrive plots of this kind, expected that if he took away the shepherds, he would easily be able to scatter the flocks. But He who takes the wise in their craftiness, wishing to show him that men do not govern His church, but that it is He himself who everywhere tends those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, agreed that this should be, that he might see, when they were taken away, that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was not defeated, nor the word of preaching quenched, but rather increased; that by these very works he might learn both himself, and all those who minister to him, that our affairs are not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but that the subject of our teaching has its root on high, from the heavens; and that it is God who everywhere leads the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that it is not possible for him who fights against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ever to win the day. But the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> did not only work this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but another also not less than this. For not only in the cities over which they presided, did he suffer the Bishops to be slaughtered; but he took them into foreign territory and slew them; and he did this, in anxiety at once to take them when destitute of friends, and hoping to render them weaker with the toil of their journey, which accordingly he did with this saint. For he called him away from our city to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, making the course twice as long, expecting to depress his mind both by the length of the way and the number of the days, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that having Jesus with him, as a fellow traveller, and fellow exile on so long a journey, he rather became the stronger, and afforded more <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the power that was with him, and to a greater degree knit the Churches together. For the cities which were on the road running together from all sides, encouraged the athlete, and sped him on his way with many supplies, sharing in his conflict by their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and intercessions. And they derived no little comfort when they saw the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> hastening to death with so much readiness, as is consistent in one called to the realms which are in the heaven, and by means of the works themselves, by the readiness and by the joyousness of that noble man, that it was not death to which he was hastening, but a kind of long journey and migration from this world, and ascension to heaven; and he departed teaching these things in every city, both by his words, and by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and as happened in the case of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when they bound <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and sent him to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and thought that they were sending him to death, they were sending a teacher to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who dwelt there. This indeed accordingly happened in the case of <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> in larger measure. For not to those alone who dwell in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, but to all the cities lying in the intervening space, he went forth as a wonderful teacher, persuading them to despise the present life, and to think naught of the things which are seen, and to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those which are to come, to look towards heaven, and to pay no regard to any of the terrors of this present life. For on this and on more than this, by means of his works, he went on his way instructing them, as a sun rising from the east, and hastening to the west. But rather more brilliant than this, for this is wont to run on high, bringing material light, but <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a> shone below, imparting to men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> the intellectual light of doctrine. And that light on departing into the regions of the west, is hidden and straightway causes the night to come on. But this on departing to the regions of the west, shone there more brilliantly, conferring the greatest benefits to all along the road. And when he arrived at the city, even <em>that</em> he instructed in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> wisdom. For on this account God permitted him there to end his life, so that this man's death might be instructive to all who dwell in Rome. For <em>we</em> by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God need henceforward no evidence, being rooted in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But they who dwelt in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, inasmuch as there was great impiety there, required more help. On this account both Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and this man after them, were all slain there, partly, indeed, in order that they might purify with their own blood, the city which had been defiled with blood of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and partly in order that they might by their works afford a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the resurrection of the crucified Christ, persuading those who dwell in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, that they would not with so much pleasure disdain this present life, did they not firmly persuade themselves that they were about to ascend to the crucified Jesus, and to see him in the heavens. For in reality it is the greatest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the resurrection that the slain Christ should show forth so great power after death, as to persuade living men to despise both country and home and friends, and acquaintance and life itself, for the sake of confessing him, and to choose in place of present pleasures, both stripes and dangers and death. For these are not the achievements of any dead man, nor of one remaining in the tomb but of one risen and living. Since how couldest thou account, when he was alive, for all the Apostles who companied with him becoming weaker through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to betray their teachers and to flee and depart; but when he died, for not only Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, but even <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who had not even seen him, nor enjoyed his companionship, showing such earnestness as to lay down life itself for his sake?</p>

<p>5. In order then that all who dwell in Rome might learn that these things are a reality, God allowed that there the saint should be perfected,  and that this was the reason I will guarantee from the very manner of his death. For not outside the walls, in a dungeon, nor even in a court of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nor in some corner, did he receive the sentence which condemned him, but in the midst of the theatre, while the whole city was seated above him, he underwent this form of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, wild beasts being let loose upon him, in order that he might plant his trophy against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>, beneath the eyes of all, and make all spectators emulous of his own conflicts. Not dying thus nobly only, but dying even with pleasure. For not as though about to be severed from life, but as called to a better and more spiritual life, so he beheld the wild beasts gladly. Whence is this manifest? From the words which he uttered when about to die, for when he heard that this manner of punishment awaited him, <q>may I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>,</q> said he, <q>of these wild beasts.</q>  For such are the loving. For they receive with pleasure whatever they may suffer for the sake of those who are beloved, and they seem to have their desire satisfied when what happens to them is more than usually grievous. Which happened, therefore, in this man's case. For not by his death alone, but also by his readiness he studied to emulate the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and hearing that they, after they had been scourged retired with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, himself too wished to imitate his teachers, not only by his death, but by his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. On this account he said, <q>may I have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your wild beasts,</q> and much milder than the tongue of the tyrant did he consider the mouths of these; and very reasonably. For while that invited him to Gehenna, their mouths escorted him to a kingdom. When, therefore, he made an end of life there, yea rather, when he ascended to heaven, he departed henceforward crowned. For this also happened through the dispensation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that he restored him again to us, and distributed the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> to the cities. For that city received his blood as it dropped, but you were honoured with his remains, you enjoyed his <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, they enjoyed his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. They saw him in conflict, and victorious, and crowned, but you have him continually. For a little time God removed him from you, and with greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> granted him again to you. And as those who borrow money, return with interest what they receive, so also <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, using this valued treasure of yours, for a little while, and having shown it to that city, with greater brilliancy gave it back to you. You sent forth a Bishop, and received a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; ye sent him forth with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and you received him with crowns; and not only ye, but all the cities which intervene. For how do ye think that they behaved when they saw his remains being brought back? What pleasure was produced! How they rejoiced! With what applause on all sides they beset the crowned one! For as with a noble athlete, who has wrestled down all his antagonists, and who comes forth with radiant <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from the arena, the spectators receive him, and do not suffer him to tread the earth, bringing him home on their shoulders, and besetting him with countless praises: so also the cities in order receiving this saint then from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and bearing him upon their shoulders as far as this city, escorted the crowned one with praises, celebrating the champion, in song; laughing the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> to scorn, because his artifice was turned against him, and what he thought to do against the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, this turned out for his behoof. Then, indeed, he profited, and encouraged all the cities; and from that time to this day he enriches this city, and as some perpetual treasure, drawn upon every day, yet not failing, makes all who partake of it more prosperous, so also this <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">blessed Ignatius</a> fills those who come to him with blessings, with boldness, nobleness of spirit, and much <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and so sends them home.</p>

<p>Not only today, therefore, but every day let us go forth to him, plucking spiritual fruits from him. For it is, it is possible for him who comes hither with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to gather the fruit of many <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. For not the bodies only, but the very sepulchres of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have been filled with spiritual <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For if in the case of Elisha this happened, and a corpse when it touched the sepulchre, burst the bands of death and returned to life again, <span class="stiki" id="note190381"><a href="../bible/2ki013.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;13:21</a></span> much rather now, when <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is more abundant, when the energy of the spirit is greater, is it possible that one touching a sepulchre, with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, should win great power; thence on this account God allowed us the remains of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, wishing to lead by them us to the same emulation, and to afford us a kind of haven, and a secure consolation for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which are ever overtaking us. Wherefore I beseech you all, if any is in despondency, if in disease, if under insult, if in any other circumstance of this life, if in the depth of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, let him come hither with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and he will lay aside all those things, and will return with much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, having procured a lighter <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> from the sight alone. But more, it is not only necessary that those who are in affliction should come hither, but if any one be in cheerfulness, in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in power, in much assurance towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, let not this man despise the benefit. For coming hither and beholding this saint, he will keep these noble possessions unmoved, persuading his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be moderate by the recollection of this man's mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and not suffering his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> by the mighty <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> to be lifted up to any self conceit. And it is no slight thing for those in prosperity not to be puffed up at their good fortune, but to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to bear their prosperity with moderation, so that the treasure is serviceable to all, the resting place is suitable, for the fallen, in order that they may escape from their <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, for the fortunate, that their success may remain secure, for those in weakness indeed, that they may return to health, and for the healthy, that they may not fall into weakness. Considering all which things, let us prefer this way of spending our time, to all delight, all pleasure, in order that rejoicing at once, and profiting, we may be able to become partakers with these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, both of their dwelling and of their home, through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> themselves, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Father with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, now and always forever and ever <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>.</p>
