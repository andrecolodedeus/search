<h1>Homily on the Paralytic Let Down Through the Roof</h1>

<p>1. Having lately come across the incident of the paralytic  who lay upon his bed beside the pool, we discovered a rich and large treasure, not by delving in the ground, but by diving into his heart: we found a treasure not containing silver and gold and precious stones, but endurance, and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, and patience and much hope towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is more valuable than any kind of jewel or source of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. For material riches are liable to the designs of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and the tales of false accusers, and the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of housebreakers, and the villany of servants, and when they have escaped all these things, they often bring the greatest ruin upon those who possess them by exciting the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, and consequently breeding countless storms of trouble. But the spiritual riches escape all these occasions of mischief and are superior to all abuse of this kind, laughing to scorn both <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and housebreakers, and slanderers, and false accusers and death itself. For they are not parted from the possessor by death, but on the contrary the possession becomes then more especially secured to the owners, and they accompany them on their journey to the other world, and are transplanted with them to the future life, and become marvellous advocates of those with whom they depart hence, and render the judge propitious to them.</p>

<p>This <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> we found in great abundance stored in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the paralytic. And you are witnesses who with great <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> drew up draughts of this treasure yet without exhausting it. For such is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of spiritual <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; it resembles fountains of water, or rather exceeds their plenteousness, being most abundant when it has many to draw upon it. For when it enters into any man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> it is not divided, not diminished, but coming in its entireness to each remains continually unconsumed, being incapable of ever failing: which was just what took place at that time. For although so many have applied to the treasure, and all are drawing upon it as much as they can&mdash; but why do I speak of you, seeing that it has made countless <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> rich from that time to the present day, and yet abides in its original perfection? Let us not then grow weary in having recourse to this source of spiritual <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>: but as far as possible let us now also draw forth draughts from it, and let us gaze upon our merciful Lord, gaze upon His patient servant. He had been thirty and eight years struggling with an incurable infirmity and was perpetually plagued by it, yet he did not repine, he did not utter a <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> word, he did not accuse his Maker, but endured his calamity bravely and with much meekness. And whence is this manifest? You say: for Scripture has not told us anything clearly concerning his former life, but only that he had been thirty-eight years in his infirmity; it has not added a word to prove that he did not show discontent, or <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> or petulance. And yet it has made this plain also, if any one will pay careful attention to it, not looking at it curiously and carelessly. For when you hear that on the approach of Christ who was a stranger to him, and regarded merely as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, he spoke to him with such great meekness, you may be able to perceive his former wisdom. For when Jesus said to him <q>Will you be made whole?</q> he did not make the natural reply you see me who have been this long time lying sick of the palsy, and do you ask me if I wish to be made whole? Have you come to insult my distress, to reproach me and laugh me to scorn and make a mock of my calamity? He did not say or conceive anything of this kind but meekly replied <q>Yea Lord.</q>  Now if after thirty-eight; years he was thus meek and gentle, when all the vigour and strength of his reasoning faculties was broken down, consider what he is likely to have been at the outset of his trouble. For be assured that invalids are not so hard to please at the beginning of their disorder, as they are after a long lapse of time: they become most intractable, most intolerable to all, when the malady is prolonged. But as he, after so many years, was so wise, and replied with so much forbearance, it is quite clear that during the previous time also he had been bearing that calamity with much thankfulness.</p>

<p>Considering these things then let us imitate the patience of our fellow-servant: for his paralysis is sufficient to brace up our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: for no one can be so supine and indolent after having observed the magnitude of that calamity as not to endure bravely all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which may befall him, even if they are more intolerable than all that were ever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For not only his soundness but also his sickness has become a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the greatest benefit to us: for his cure has stimulated the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the hearers to speak the praise of the Lord, and his sickness and infirmity has encouraged you to patience, and urged you to match his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; or rather it has exhibited to you the lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the actual deliverance of the man to such a malady, and the protracted duration of his infirmity is a sign of the greatest care for his welfare. For as a gold refiner having cast a piece of gold into the furnace suffers it to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the fire until such time as he sees it has become purer: even so God permits the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men to be tested by troubles until they become pure and transparent and have reaped much profit from this process of sifting: wherefore this is the greatest species of benefit.</p>

<p>2. Let us not then be disturbed, neither dismayed, when trials befall us. For if the gold refiner sees how long he ought to leave the piece of gold in the furnace, and when he ought to draw it out, and does not allow it to remain in the fire until it is destroyed and burnt up: much more does God understand this, and when He sees that we have become more pure, He releases us from our trials so that we may not be overthrown and cast down by the multiplication of our <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Let us then not be repining, or faint-hearted, when some unexpected thing befalls us; but let us suffer Him who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> these things accurately, to prove our hearts by fire as long as He pleases: for He does this for a useful purpose and with a view to the profit of those who are tried.</p>

<p>On this account a certain wise man admonishes us saying <q>My Son, if you come to serve the Lord prepare your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, set your heart aright and constantly endure and make not haste in time of trouble;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190702"><a href="../bible/sir001.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;1:1-2</a></span> <q>yield to Him</q> he says, <q>in all things,</q> for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> exactly when it is right to pluck us out of the furnace of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. We ought therefore everywhere to yield to Him and always to give thanks, and to bear all things contentedly, whether He bestows benefits or chastisement upon us, for this also is a species of benefit. For the physician, not only when he bathes and nourishes the patient and conducts him into pleasant gardens, but also when he uses cautery and the knife, is a physician all the same: and a father not only when he caresses his son, but also when he expels him from his house, and when he chides and scourges him, is a father all the same, no less than when he praises him. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> therefore that God is more tenderly loving than all physicians, do not enquire too curiously concerning His treatment nor demand an account of it from Him, but whether He is pleased to let us go free or whether He punishes, let us offer ourselves for either alike; for He seeks by means of each to lead us back to health, and to communion with Himself, and He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> our several needs, and what is expedient for each one, and how and in what manner we ought to be saved, and along that path He leads us. Let us then follow wherever He bids us, and let us not too carefully consider whether He commands us to go by a smooth and easy path, or by a difficult and rugged one: as in the case of this paralytic. It was one species of benefit indeed that his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should be purged by the long duration of his suffering, being delivered to the fiery trial of affliction as to a kind of furnace; but it was another benefit no less than this that God was present with him in the midst of the trials, and afforded him great consolation. He it was who strengthened him, and upheld him, and stretched forth a hand to him, and suffered him not to fall. But when you hear that it was God Himself do not deprive the paralytic of his meed of praise, neither him nor any other man who is tried and yet steadfastly endures. For even if we be infinitely wise, even if we are mightier and stronger than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, yet in the absence of His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we shall not be able to withstand even the most ordinary <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. And why do I speak of such insignificant and abject beings as we are? For even if one were a <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, or a Peter, or a James, or a John, yet if he should be deprived of the divine help he would easily be put to shame, overthrown, and laid prostrate. And on behalf of these I will read you the words of Christ Himself: for He says to Peter <q>Behold <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has asked to have you that he may sift you as wheat, but I have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for you that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190703"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;22:31-32</a></span> What is the meaning of <q>sift</q>? To turn and twist, and shake and stir and shatter, and worry, which is what takes place in the case of things which are winnowed: but I he says have restrained him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you are not able to endure the trial, for the expression <q>that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fail not</q> is the utterance of one who signifies that if he had permitted it his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> would have failed. Now if Peter who was such a fervent lover of Christ and exposed his life for Him countless times and sprang into the foremost rank in the Apostolic band, and was pronounced blessed by his Master, and called Peter on this account because he kept a firm and inflexible hold of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, would have been carried away and fallen from profession if Christ had permitted the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to try him as much as he desired, what other man will be able to stand, apart from His help? Therefore also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says <q>But God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> also make the way of escape that you may be able to bear it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190704"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> For not only does He say that He does not suffer a trial to be inflicted beyond our strength, but even in that which is proportioned to our strength He is present carrying us through it, and bracing us up, if only we ourselves first of all contribute the means which are at our disposal, such as <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, hope in Him, thanksgiving, endurance, patience. For not only in the dangers which are beyond our strength, but in those which are proportioned to it, we need the divine assistance, if we are to make a brave stand; for elsewhere also it is said <q>even as the sufferings of Christ abound to us, even so our comfort also abounds through Christ, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  So then he who comforted this man is the same who permitted the trial to be inflicted upon him. And now observe after the cure what tenderness He displays. For He did not leave him and depart, but having found him in the temple he says <q>behold! You are made whole; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more lest some worse thing happen unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190706"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;5:14</a></span> For had He permitted the punishment because He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him He would not have released him, He would not have provided for his future safety: but the expression <q>lest some worse thing happen unto you</q> is the utterance of one who would check coming <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> beforehand. He put an end to the disease, but did not put an end to the struggle: He expelled the infirmity but did not expel the dread of it, so that the benefit which had been wrought might remain unmoved. This is the part of a tender-hearted physician, not only to put an end to present pains, but to provide for future security, which also Christ did, bracing up his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the recollection of past events. For seeing that when the things which distress us have departed, the recollection of them oftentimes departs with them, He wishing it to abide continually, says <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more lest some worse thing happen unto you.</q></p>

<p>3. Moreover it is possible to discern His forethought and consideration not only from this, but also from that which seems to be a rebuke. For He did not make a public exposure of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but yet He told him that he suffered what he did suffer on account of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but what those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were He did not disclose; nor did He say <q>you have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a></q> or <q>you have transgressed,</q> but He indicated the fact by one simple utterance <q><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more;</q> and having said so much as just to remind him of it He put him more on the alert against future events, and at the same time He made manifest to us all his patience and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and wisdom, having reduced him to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of publicly lamenting his calamity, and having displayed his own earnestness on the man's behalf, <q>for while I am coming,</q> he says, <q>another steps down before me:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190707"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;5:7</a></span> yet he did not publicly expose his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For just as we ourselves desire to draw a veil over our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> even so does God much more than we: on this account He wrought the cure in the presence of all, but He gives the exhortation or the advice privately. For He never makes a public display of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, except at any time He sees men insensible to them. For when He says <q>ye saw me hungry, and fed me not: and thirsty and gave me no drink,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190708"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;25:12</a></span> He speaks thus at the present time in order that we may not hear these words in time to come. He threatens, He exposes us in this world, that He may not have to expose us in the other: even as He threatened to overthrow the city of the Ninevites <span class="stiki" id="note190709"><a href="../bible/jon001.htm#verse2">Jonah&nbsp;1:2</a></span> for the very reason that He might not overthrow it. For if He wished to publish our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> He would not announce beforehand that He would publish them: but as it is He does make this announcement in order that being sobered by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of exposure, if not also by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment we may purge ourselves from them all. This also is what takes place in the case of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: for He conducts the man to the pool of water without disclosing his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to any one; yet He publicly presents the boon and makes it manifest to all, while the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the man are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to no one save God Himself and him who receives the forgiveness of them. This also was what took place in the case of this paralytic, He makes the reproof without the presence of witnesses, or rather the utterance is not merely a reproof but also a justification; He justifies Himself as it were for evil-entreating him so long, telling him and proving to him that it was not without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and purpose that He had suffered him to be so long afflicted, for He reminded him of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and declared the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his infirmity. <q>For having found him,</q> we read, <q>in the temple, He said unto him, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more lest some worse thing happen unto you.</q></p>

<p>And now since we have derived so much profit from the account of the former paralytic let us turn to the other who is presented to us in St. Matthew's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For in the case of mines where any one happens to find a piece of gold he makes a further excavation again in the same place: and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many of those who read without care <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that one and the same paralytic is presented by the four <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>: but it is not so. Therefore you must be on the alert, and pay careful attention to the matter. For the question is not concerned with ordinary matters, and this discourse when it has received its proper solution will be serviceable against both Greeks and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and many of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For thus all find fault with the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> as being at strife and variance: yet this is not the fact, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> forbid! But although the outward appearance is different, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit which works upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of each is one, and where the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit is, there is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and peace; and there <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and disputation, strife and contention are not. How then shall we make it clear that this paralytic is not the same as the other, but a different man? By many tokens, both of place and time, and season, and day, and from the manner of the cure, and the coming of the physician and the loneliness of the man who was healed. And what of this? Some one will say: for have not many of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> given diverse accounts of other signs? Yes, but it is one thing to make statements which are diverse, and another, statements which are contradictory; for the former causes no discord or strife: but that which is now presented to us is a strong case of contradiction unless it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the paralytic at the pool was a different man from him who is described by the other three <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>. Now that you may understand what is the difference between statements which are diverse and contradictory, one of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> has stated that Christ carried the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note190710"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;19:17</a></span> another that Simon the Cyrenian carried it:  but this causes no contradiction or strife. <q>And how,</q> you say, <q>is there no contradiction between the statements that he carried and did not carry?</q> Because both took place. When they went out of the Pr&aelig;torium Christ was carrying it: but as they proceeded Simon took it from Him and bore it. Again in the case of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, one says that the two <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>:  another that one of them checked him who was reviling the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note190713"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse40">Luke&nbsp;23:40</a></span> Yet in this again there is no contradiction: because here also both things took place, and at the beginning both the men behaved ill: but afterwards when signs occurred, when the earth shook and the rocks were rent, and the sun was darkened, one of them was converted, and became more chastened, and recognized the crucified one and acknowledged his kingdom. For to prevent your supposing that this took place by some constraining force of one impelling him from within, and to remove your perplexity, he exhibits the man to you on the cross while he is still retaining his former <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in order that you may perceive that his conversion was effected from within and out of his own heart assisted by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and so he became a better man.</p>

<p>4. And it is possible to collect many other instances of this kind from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, which seem to have a suspicion of contradiction, where there is no real contradiction, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being that some incidents have been related by this writer, others by that; or if not occurring at the same hour one author has related the earlier event, another the later; but in the present case there is nothing of this kind, but the multitude of the evidences which I have mentioned proves to those who pay any attention whatever to the matter, that the paralytic was not the same man in both instances. And this would be no slight <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to demonstrate that the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> were in harmony with each other and not at variance. For if it were the same man the discord is great between the two accounts: but if it be a different one all material for dispute has been destroyed.</p>

<p>Well then let me now state the actual reasons why I affirm that this man is not the same as that. What are they? The one is cured in Jerusalem, the other in Capernaum; the one by the pool of water, the other in some house; there is the evidence from place: the former during the festival: there is the evidence from the special season: the former had been thirty and eight years suffering from infirmity: concerning the other the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> relates nothing of that kind: there is the evidence from time: the former was cured on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>: there is the evidence from the day: for had this man also been cured on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> Matthew would not have passed by the fact in silence nor would the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who were present have held their peace: for they who found fault for some other reason even when a man was not cured on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> would have been yet more violent in their accusation against Christ if they had got an additional handle from the argument of the special day. Moreover this man was brought to Christ: to the other Christ Himself came, and there was no man to assist him. <q>Lord,</q> said he, <q>I have no man:</q> whereas this man had many who came to his aid, who also let him down through the roof. And He healed the body of the other man before his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for after he had cured the paralysis He then said <q>Behold you are made whole, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more:</q> but not so in this case, but after He had healed his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for He said to him <q>Son be of good cheer your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be forgiven you,</q> He then cured his paralysis. That this man then is not the same as the other has been clearly demonstrated by these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, but it now remains for us to turn to the beginning of the narrative and see how Christ cured the one and the other, and why differently in each case: why the one on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> and the other not on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, why He came Himself to the one but waited for the other to be brought to Him, why He healed the body of the one and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the other first. For He does not these things without consideration and purpose seeing that He is wise and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>. Let us then give our attention and observe Him as He performs the cure. For if in the case of physicians when they use the knife or cautery or operate in any other way upon a maimed and crippled patient, and cut off a limb, many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> crowd round the invalid and the physician who is doing these things, much more ought we to act thus in this case, in proportion as the physician is greater and the malady more severe, being one which cannot be corrected by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> art, but only by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>. And in the former case we have to see the skin being cut, and matter discharging, and gore set in motion, and to endure much discomfort produced by the spectacle, and great pain and sorrow not merely from the sight of the wounds, but also from the suffering undergone by those who are subjected to this burning or cutting: for no one is so stony-hearted as to stand by those who are suffering these things, and hear them shrieking, without being himself overcome and agitated, and experiencing much depression of spirit; but yet we undergo all this owing to our desire to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the operation. But in this case nothing of that kind has to be seen, no application of fire, no plunging in of an instrument, no flowing of blood, no pain or shrieking of the patient; and the reason of this is, the wisdom of the healer, which needs none of these external aids, but is absolutely self-sufficient. For it is enough that He merely utters a command and all distress ceases. And the wonder is not only that He effects the cure with so much ease, but also without pain, causing no trouble to those who are being healed.</p>

<p>Seeing then that the marvel is greater and the cure more important, and the pleasure afforded to the spectators unalloyed by any kind of sorrow, let us now carefully contemplate Christ in the act of healing. And He entered into a boat and crossed over and came into His own city: and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> said unto the sick of the palsy <q>Son! Be of good cheer: your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190714"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;9:1-2</a></span> Now they were inferior to the centurion in respect of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but superior to the impotent man by the pool. For the former neither invited the physician nor brought the sick man to the physician; but approached Him as God and said <q>Speak the word only and my servant shall be healed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190715"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;7:7</a></span> Now these men did not invite the physician to the house, and so far they are on an equality with the centurion: but they brought the sick man to the physician and so far they are inferior, because they did not say <q>speak the word only.</q> Yet they are far better than the man lying by the pool. For he said <q>Lord I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool:</q> but these men <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that Christ had no need either of water, or pool, or anything else of that kind: nevertheless Christ not only released the servant of the centurion but the other two men also from their maladies, and did not say: <q>because you have proffered a smaller degree of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the cure which you receive shall be in proportion;</q> but He dismissed the man who displayed the greater <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with eulogy and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, saying <q>I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no, not in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190716"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;7:9</a></span> On the man who exhibited less <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than this one he bestowed no praise yet He did not deprive him of a cure, no! not even him who displayed no <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at all. But just as physicians when curing the same disorder receive from some person a hundred gold pieces, from others half, from others less and from some nothing at all: even so Christ received from the centurion a large and unspeakable degree of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but from this man less and from the other not even an ordinary amount, and yet He healed them all. For what reason then did He deem the man who made no deposit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> worthy of the benefit? Because his failure to exhibit <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was not owing to indolence, or to insensibility of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of Christ and having never heard any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in which He was concerned either small or great. On this account therefore the man obtained indulgence: which in fact the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> obscurely intimates when he says, <q>for he knew not who it was,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190717"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;5:13</a></span> but he only recognized Him by sight when he lighted upon Him the second time.</p>

<p>5. There are indeed some who say that this man was healed merely because they who brought him <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; but this is not the fact. For <q>when He saw their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></q> refers not merely to those who brought the man but also to the man who was brought. Why so? <q>Is not one man healed,</q> you say, <q>because another has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>?</q> For my part I do not think so unless owing to immaturity of age or excessive infirmity he is in some way incapable of believing. How then was it you say that in the case of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Canaan the mother <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> but the daughter was cured? And how was it that the servant of the centurion who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> rose from the bed of sickness and was preserved. Because the sick <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> themselves were not able to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Hear then what the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Canaan says: <q>My daughter is grievously vexed with a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <span class="stiki" id="note190718"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;15:22</a></span> and sometimes she falls into the water and sometimes into the fire:</q>  now how could she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> whose mind was darkened and possessed by a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and was never able to control herself, not in her sound senses? As then in the case of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of Canaan so also in the case of the centurion; his servant lay ill in the house, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> Christ, himself, nor who He was. How then was he to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one who was unknown to him, and of whom he had never yet obtained any experience? But in the case before us we cannot say this: for the paralytic <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. Whence is this manifest? From the very manner of his approach to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For do not attend simply to the statement that they let the man down through the roof: but consider how great a matter it is for a sick man to have the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to undergo this. For you are surely aware that invalids are so faint-hearted and difficult to please as often to decline the treatment administered to them on their sick bed, and to prefer bearing the pain which arises from their maladies to undergoing the annoyance caused by the remedies. But this man had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> to go outside the house, and to be carried into the midst of the market place, and to exhibit himself in the presence of a crowd. And it is the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of sick folk to die under their disorder rather than disclose their personal calamities. This sick man however did not act thus, but when he saw that the place of assembly was filled, the approaches blocked, the haven of refuge obstructed, he submitted to be let down through the roof. So ready in contrivance is desire, so rich in resource is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <q>For he also that seeks finds, and to him that knocks it shall be opened.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190720"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;11:10</a></span> The man did not say to his friends <q>What is the meaning of this? Why make this ado? Why push on? Let us wait until the house is cleared and the assembly is dissolved: the crowds will withdraw, we shall then be able to approach him privately and confer about these matters. Why should you expose my misfortunes in the midst of all the spectators, and let me down from the roof-top, and behave in an unseemly manner?</q> That man said none of these things either to himself or to his bearers, but regarded it as an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to have so many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> made witnesses of his cure. And not from this circumstance only was it possible to discern his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> but also from the actual words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For after he had been let down and presented Christ said to him, <q>Son! Be of good cheer, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you.</q> And when he heard these words he was not indignant, he did not complain, he did not say to the physician <q>What mean you by this? I came to be healed of one thing and you heal another. This is an excuse and a pretence and a screen of incompetence. Do you forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are invisible?</q> He neither spoke nor thought any of these things, but waited, allowing the physician to adopt the method of healing which He desired. For this reason also Christ did not go to him, but waited for him to come, that He might exhibit his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to all. For could He not have made the entrance easy? But He did none of these things; in order that He might exhibit the man's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and fervent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to all. For as He went to the man who had been suffering thirty and eight years because he had no one to aid him, so did He wait for this man to come to him because he had many friends that He might make his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> manifest by the man being brought to Him, and inform us of the other man's loneliness by going to him, and disclose the earnestness of the one and the patience of the other to all and especially to those who were present. For some <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and misanthropical <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were accustomed to grudge the benefits done to their neighbours and to find fault with His <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, sometimes on account of the special season, saying that He healed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> day; sometimes on account of the life of those to whom the benefit was done, saying <q>if this man were a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> He would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was who touched Him:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190721"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;7:39</a></span> not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is the special mark of a physician to associate with the infirm and to be constantly seen by the side of the sick, not to avoid them, or hurry from their presence&mdash; which in fact was what He expressly said to those murmurers; <q>They that are whole have no need of a physician but they that are sick.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190722"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12</a></span> Therefore in order to prevent their making the same accusations again He proves first of all that they who come to Him are deserving of a cure on account of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which they exhibit. For this reason He exhibited the loneliness of one man, and the fervent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the other: for this reason He healed the one on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, the other not on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>: in order that when you see them accusing and rebuking Christ on another day you may understand that they accused him on the former occasion also not because of their respect for the law, but because they could not contain their own <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. But why did He not first address Himself to the cure of the paralytic, but said, <q>Son! Be of good cheer, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you?</q> He did this very wisely. For it is a habit with physicians to destroy the originating <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the malady before they remove the malady itself. Often for example when the eyes are distressed by some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> humour and corrupt discharge, the physician, abandoning any treatment of the disordered vision, turns his attention to the head, where the root and origin of the infirmity is: even so did Christ act: He represses first of all the source of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For the source and root and mother of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This it is which enervates our bodies: this it is which brings on disease: therefore also on this occasion He said, <q>Son! Be of good cheer, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you.</q> And on the other He said, <q>Behold! You are made whole, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no more lest some worse thing happen unto you,</q> intimating to both that these maladies were the offspring of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And in the beginning and outset of the word disease as the consequence of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> attacked the body of Cain. For after the <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> of his brother, after that act of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, his body was subject to palsy.  For trembling is the same thing as palsy. For when the strength which regulates a living creature becomes weakened, being no longer able to support all the limbs, it deprives them of their natural power of direction, and then having become unstrung they tremble and turn giddy.</p>

<p>6. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also demonstrated this: for when he was reproaching the Corinthians with a certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he said, <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> many are weak and sickly among you.</q> Therefore also Christ first removes the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and having said <q>Son! Be of good cheer, your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you,</q> He uplifts the spirit and rouses the downcast <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: for the speech became an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and having entered into the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> it laid hold of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself and cast out of it all distress. For nothing creates pleasure and affords confidence so much as freedom from self-reproach. For where remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is there is sonship. Even so at least we are not able to call God Father until we have washed away our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the pool of the sacred water. It is when we have come up from thence, having put off that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> load, that we say <q>Our Father which art in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> But in the case of the man who was infirm thirty and eight years why did He not act thus, but cured his body first of all? Because by that long period of time his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> had been exhausted: for the magnitude of a trial can lighten the load of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; as indeed we read was the case with Lazarus, that he received his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things in full, and thereupon was comforted: and again in another place we read, <q>Comfort ye my people, say ye to the heart of Jerusalem, that she has received of the Lord's hand double for her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190724"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;40:1-2</a></span> And again the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says <q>O Lord give us peace, for you have requited all things to us,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190725"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;26:12</a></span> indicating that penalties and punishments work forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and this we might prove from many passages. It seems to me then that the reason why He said nothing to that man about remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but only secured him against the future, was because the penalty for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> had been already worked out by the long duration of his sickness: or if this was not the reason, it was because he had not yet attained any high degree of belief concerning Christ that the Lord first addressed Himself to the lesser need, and one which was manifest and obvious, the health of the body; but in the case of the other man He did not act thus, but inasmuch as this man had more <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and a loftier <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, He spoke to him first of all concerning the more dangerous disease: with the additional object of exhibiting his equality of rank with the Father. For just as in the former case He healed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> because He wished to lead men away from the Jewish mode of observing it, and to take occasion from their reproaches to prove Himself equal with the Father: even so in this instance also, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> beforehand what they were going to say, He uttered these words that He might use them as a starting-point and a pretext for proving His equality of rank with the Father. For it is one thing when no one brings an accusation or charge to enter spontaneously upon a discourse about these things, and quite another when other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> give occasion for it, to set about the same work in the order and shape of a defence. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the former demonstration was a stumbling block to the hearers: but the other was less offensive, and more acceptable, and everywhere we see Him doing this, and manifesting His equality not so much by words as by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. This at any rate is what the Evangelist implied when he said that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Jesus not only because He broke the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> but also because He said that God was His Father, making Himself equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note190726"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;5:16</a></span> which is a far greater thing, for He effected this by the demonstration of His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. How then do the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> act, and those who seek to find a handle in every direction? <q>Why does this man <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a>?</q> they say for <q>no man can forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> save God alone.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190727"><a href="../bible/mar002.htm#verse7">Mark&nbsp;2:7</a></span> As they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Him there because He broke the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, and took occasion from their reproaches to declare His equality with the Father in the form of a defence, saying <q>my Father works hitherto and I work,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190728"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;5:17</a></span> so here also starting from the accusations which they make He proves from these His exact likeness to the Father. For what was it they said? <q>No man can forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> save God alone.</q> Inasmuch then as they themselves laid down this definition, they themselves introduced the rule, they themselves declared the law, He proceeds to entangle them by means of their own words. <q>You have confessed,</q> He says, <q>that forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is an attribute of God alone: my equality therefore is unquestionable.</q> And it is not these men only who declare this but also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> thus saying: <q>who is God as thou?</q> and then, indicating His special attribute he adds <q>taking away iniquity and passing over unrighteousness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190729"><a href="../bible/mic007.htm#verse18">Micah&nbsp;7:18</a></span> If then any one else appears thus doing the same thing He also is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, God even as that one is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But let us observe how Christ argues with them, how meekly and gently, and with all tenderness. <q>And behold some of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> said within themselves: this man blasphemes.</q> They did not utter the word, they did not proclaim it through the tongue, but reasoned in the secret recesses of their heart. How then did Christ act? He made public their secret thoughts before the demonstration which was concerned with the cure of the paralytic's body, wishing to prove to them the power of His Godhead. For that it is an attribute of God alone, a sign of His deity to show the secrets of His <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says <q>Thou alone <a href="../cathen/08675a.htm">know</a> men's hearts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190730"><a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;8:39</a></span> Do you see that this word <q>alone,</q> is not used with a view of contrasting the Son with the Father. For if the Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the heart, how does the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the secrets of the mind? <q>For He Himself</q> it is said, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what was in man;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190731"><a href="../bible/joh002.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;2:25</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when proving that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of secret things is a special attribute of God says, <q>and He that search the heart,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190732"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse27">Romans&nbsp;8:27</a></span> showing that this expression is equivalent to the appellation <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> For just as when I say <q>He who causes rain said,</q> I signify none other than God by mentioning the deed, since it is one which belongs to Him alone: and when I say <q>He who makes the sun to rise,</q> without adding the word <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I yet signify Him by mentioning the deed: even so when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said <q>He who searches the hearts,</q> he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that to search the heart is an attribute of God alone. For if this expression had not been of equal force with the name <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></q> for pointing out Him who was signified, he would not have used it absolutely and by itself. For if the power were shared by Him in common with some created being, we should not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who was signified, the community of power causing confusion in the mind of the hearers. Inasmuch then as this appears to be a special attribute of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and yet is manifested of the Son whose equality  becomes thence unquestionable, therefore we read <q>why think ye <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your hearts? For whether is easier: to say: Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you or to say arise and walk?</q></p>

<p>7. See moreover He makes a second <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of His power of forgiving <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is a very much greater act than to heal the body, greater in proportion as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is greater than the body. For as paralysis is a disease of the body, even so <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is a disease of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: but although this is the greater it is not palpable: whereas the other although it be less is manifest. Since then He is about to use the less for a demonstration of the greater proving that He acted thus on account of their weakness, and by way of condescension to their feeble condition He says <q>whether is easier? To say your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven you or to say arise and walk?</q> For what reason then should He address Himself to the lesser act on their account? Because that which is manifest presents the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> in a more distinct form. Therefore He did not enable the man to rise until He had said to them <q>But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has power on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, (then says He to the sick of the palsy) arise and walk:</q> as if He had said: forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is indeed a greater sign: but for your sakes I add the less also since this seems to you to be a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the other. For as in another case when He praised the centurion for saying <q>speak the word only and my servant shall be healed: for I also say to this man go and he goes and to the other come and he comes,</q> He confirmed his opinion by the eulogy which He pronounced: and again when He reproved the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> for finding fault with Him on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> saying that He transgressed the law, He <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that He had authority to alter <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>: even so in this instance also when some said <q>He makes Himself equal with God by promising that which belongs only to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> He having upbraided and accused them and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> that He did not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> supplied us with indisputable evidence that He could do the same things as the Father who begot Him. Observe at least the manner in which He pleases to establish the fact that what belongs to the Father only, belongs also to Himself: for He did not simply enable the paralytic to get up, but also said <q>but that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has power on earth to forgive <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>:</q> thus it was his endeavour and earnest desire to prove above all things that He had the same authority as the Father.</p>

<p>8. Let us then carefully hold fast all these things, both those which were spoken yesterday and the day before that, and let us beseech God that they may abide immoveably in our heart, and let us contribute <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> on our side, and constantly meet in this place. For in this way we shall preserve the truths which have been formerly spoken, and we shall add others to our store; and if any of them slip from our memory through the lapse of time we shall easily be able to recover them by the aid of continual teaching. And not only will the doctrines abide sound and uncorrupt but our course of life will have the benefit of much diligent care and we shall be able to pass through this present state of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> with pleasure and cheerfulness. For whatever kind of suffering is oppressing our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when we come here will easily be got rid of: seeing that now also Christ is present, and he who approaches Him with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will readily receive healing from Him. Suppose some one is struggling with perpetual poverty, and at a loss for necessary food, and often goes to bed hungry, if he has come in here, and heard <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> saying that he passed his time in hunger and thirst and nakedness, and that he experienced this not on one or two or three days, but constantly (this at least is what he indicates when he says <q>up to the present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked</q>), <span class="stiki" id="note190733"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:11</a></span> he will receive ample consolation, learning by means of these words that God has not permitted him to be in poverty because He <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> him or abandoned him: for if this were the effect of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, He would not have permitted it in the case of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who was of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> especially dear to Him: but He permitted it out of His tender <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> care, and by way of conducting him to a higher degree of spiritual wisdom. Has some other man a body which is beset with disease and countless sufferings? The condition of these paralytics may be an ample source of consolation and besides these the blessed and brave <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who was continually suffering from disorders, and never had any respite from prolonged infirmity, even as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also said <q>Use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190734"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:23</a></span> where he does not speak merely of infirmities as such. Or another having been subjected to false accusation has acquired a bad <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> with the public, and this is continually vexing and gnawing his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: he enters this place and hears <q>Blessed are you when men shall reproach you and say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>: <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> ye and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190735"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;5:11-12</a></span> then he will lay aside all despondency and receive every kind of pleasure: for it is written <q>leap for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and be exceeding glad when men cast out your name as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190736"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;6:22-23</a></span> In this manner then God comforts those that are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spoken of, and them that speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> He puts in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> after another manner saying <q>every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> word which men shall speak they shall give an account thereof whether it be good or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190737"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;12:36</a></span> </p>

<p>Another perhaps has lost a little daughter or a son, or one of his kinsfolk, and he also having come here listens to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> groaning over this present life and longing to see that which is to come, and oppressed by his sojourn in this world, and he will go away with a sufficient remedy for his grief when he has heard him say <q>Now concerning them that are asleep I would not have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> brethren that you sorrow not even as others who have no hope.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190738"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> He did not say concerning the dying, but <q>concerning them that are asleep</q> proving that death is a sleep. As then if we see any one sleeping we are not disturbed or distressed, expecting that he will certainly get up: even so when we see any one dead, let us not be disturbed or dejected for this also is a sleep, a longer one indeed, but still a sleep. By giving it the name of slumber He comforted the mourners and overthrew the accusation of the unbelievers. If you mourn immoderately over him who has departed you will be like that unbeliever who has no hope of a resurrection. He indeed does well to mourn, inasmuch as he cannot exercise any spiritual wisdom concerning things to come: but thou who hast received such strong <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> concerning the future life, why do you sink into the same weakness with him? Therefore it is written <q>now concerning them that are asleep we would not have you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that you sorrow not even as others who have no hope.</q></p>

<p>And not only from the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> but from the Old also it is possible to receive abundant consolation. For when you hear of Job after the loss of his property, after the destruction of his herds, after the loss not of one, or two, or three, but of a whole troop of sons in the very flower of their age, after the great excellence of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which he displayed, even if you are the weakest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, you will easily be able to repent and regain your <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. For thou, O man, hast constantly attended your sick son, and hast seen him laid upon the bed, and hast heard him uttering his last words, and stood beside him while he was drawing his last breath and hast closed his eyes, and shut his mouth: but he was not present at the death struggle of his sons, he did not see them breathing their last gasp, but the house became the common grave of them all, and on the same table brains and blood were poured forth, and pieces of wood and tiles, and dust, and fragments of flesh, and all these things were mingled together in like manner. Nevertheless after such great calamities of this kind he was not petulant, but what does he say&mdash; <q>The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away; as it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> unto the Lord even so has it come to pass, blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.</q>  Let this speech be our utterance also over each event which befalls us; whether it be loss of property, or infirmity of body, or insult, or false accusation or any other form of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> incident to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, let us say these words <q>The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away; as it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the Lord so has it come to pass; blessed be the name of the Lord for ever.</q> If we practise this spiritual wisdom, we shall never experience any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, even if we undergo countless sufferings, but the gain will be greater than the loss, the good will exceed the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: by these words you will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> God to be merciful unto you, and wilt defend yourself against the tyranny of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. For as soon as your tongue has uttered these words immediately the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a> hastens from you: and when he has hastened away, the cloud of dejection also is dispelled and the thoughts which afflict us take to flight, hurrying off in company with him, and in addition to all this you will win all manner of blessings both here and in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. And you have a convincing example in the case of Job, and of the Apostle, who having for God's sake despised the troubles of this world, obtained the everlasting blessings. Let us then be trustful and in all things which befall us let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and give thanks to the merciful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we may pass through this present life with serenity, and obtain the blessings to come, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> to whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and might always, now and ever, world without end. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
