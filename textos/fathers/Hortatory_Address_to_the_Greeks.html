<h1>Hortatory Address to the Greeks</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Reasons for addressing the Greeks</h2>

<p>As I begin this hortatory address to you, you men of Greece, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> God that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I ought to say to you, and that you, shaking off your habitual  <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of disputing, and being delivered from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of your fathers, may now choose what is profitable; not fancying that you commit any offense against your forefathers, though the things which you formerly considered by no means salutary should now seem useful to you. For accurate investigation of matters, putting <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to the question with a more searching scrutiny, often reveals that things which have passed for excellent are of quite another sort. Since, then, we propose to discourse of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion (than which, I think, there is nothing which is counted more valuable by those who desire to pass through life without danger, on account of the judgment which is to be after the termination of this life, and which is announced not only by our forefathers according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to wit the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and lawgivers, but also by those among yourselves who have been esteemed wise, not poets alone, but also <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who professed among you that they had attained the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>), I think it well first of all to examine the teachers of religion, both our own and yours, who they were, and how great, and in what times they lived; in order that those who have formerly received from their fathers the false religion, may now, when they perceive this, be extricated from that inveterate <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and that we may clearly and manifestly show that we ourselves follow the religion of our forefathers according to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The poets are unfit to be religious teachers</h2>

<p>Whom, then, you men of Greece, do you call your teachers of religion? The poets? It will do your <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> no good to say so to men who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the poets; for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how very ridiculous a theogony they have composed&mdash;as we can learn from Homer, your most distinguished and prince of poets. For he says, first, that the gods were in the beginning generated from water; for he has written thus: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Both ocean, the origin of the gods, and their mother Tethys</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And then we must also remind you of what he further says of him whom you consider the first of the gods, and whom he often calls <q>the father of gods and men;</q> for he said: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Zeus, who is the dispenser of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to men.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Indeed, he says that he was not only the dispenser of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> to the army, but also the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> to the Trojans, by means of his daughter;  and Homer introduces him in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and bitterly complaining, and bewailing himself, and plotted against by the other gods, and at one time exclaiming concerning his own son: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Alas! He falls, my most beloved of men!<br>Sarpedon, vanquished by Patroclus, falls.<br>So will the fates.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And at another time concerning Hector: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Ah! I behold a warrior dear to me<br>Around the walls of Ilium driven, and grieve<br>For Hector.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And what he says of the conspiracy of the other gods against Zeus, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who read these words:  <q>When the other Olympians&mdash; Juno, and Neptune, and Minerva &mdash; wished to bind him.</q> And unless the blessed gods had feared him whom gods call Briareus, Zeus would have been bound by them. And what Homer says of his intemperate loves, we must remind you in the very words he used. For he said that Zeus spoke thus to Juno: &mdash;  </p> <blockquote><p><q>For never goddess pour'd, nor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> yet,<br>So full a tide of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> into my breast;<br>I never loved Ixion's consort thus,<br>Nor sweet Acrisian Dana&euml;, from whom<br>Sprang Perseus, noblest of the race of man;<br>Nor Ph&oelig;nix' daughter fair, of whom were born<br>Minos, unmatch'd but by the powers above,<br>And Rhadamanthus; nor yet Semele,<br>Nor yet Alcmene, who in Thebes produced<br>The valiant Hercules; and though my son<br>By Semele were Bacchus, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of man;<br>Nor Ceres golden-hair'd, nor high-enthron'd<br>Latona in the skies; no&mdash; nor yourself<br>As now I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, and my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> perceive<br>O'erwhelm'd with sweetness of intense desire.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>It is fit that we now mention what one can learn from the work of Homer of the other gods, and what they suffered at the hands of men. For he says that Mars and Venus were wounded by Diomed, and of many others of the gods he relates the sufferings. For thus we can gather from the case of Dione consoling her daughter; for she said to her: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Have patience, dearest child; though much enforc'd<br>Restrain your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>: we, in heav'n who dwell,<br>Have much to bear from mortals; and ourselves<br>Too oft upon each other suff'rings lay:<br>Mars had his suff'rings; by Al&ouml;eus sons,<br>Otus and Ephialtes, strongly bound,<br>He thirteen months in brazen fetters lay:<br>Juno, too, suffer'd, when Amphitryon's son<br>Thro' her right breast a three-barb'd arrow sent:<br>Dire, and unheard of, were the pangs she bore,<br>Great Pluto's self the stinging arrow felt,<br>When that same son of &AElig;gis-bearing Jove<br>Assail'd him in the very gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,<br>And wrought him keenest anguish; pierced with pain,<br>To high Olympus, to the courts of Jove,<br>Groaning, he came; the bitter shaft remain'd<br>Deep in his shoulder fix'd, and griev'd his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>But if it is right to remind you of the battle of the gods, opposed to one another, your own poet himself will recount it, saying: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Such was the shock when gods in battle met;<br>For there to royal Neptune stood oppos'd<br>Ph&oelig;bus Apollo with his arrows keen;<br>The blue-eyed Pallas to the god of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>;<br>To Juno, Dian, heav'nly archeress,<br>Sister of Ph&oelig;bus, golden-shafted queen.<br>Stout Hermes, helpful god, Latona fac'd.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>These and such like things did Homer teach you; and not Homer only, but also Hesiod. So that if you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> your most distinguished poets, who have given the genealogies of your gods, you must of necessity either suppose that the gods are such beings as these, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there are no gods at all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Opinions of the school of Thales</h2>

<p>And if you decline citing the poets, because you say it is allowable for them to frame myths, and to relate in a mythical way many things about the gods which are far from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, do you suppose you have some others for your religious teachers, or how do you say that they themselves  have learned this religion of yours? For it is impossible that any should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> matters so great and divine, who have not themselves learned them first from the initiated.  You will no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> say, <q>The sages and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>.</q> For to them, as to a fortified wall, you are wont to flee, when any one quotes the opinions of your poets about the gods. Therefore, since it is fit that we commence with the ancients and the earliest, beginning thence I will produce the opinion of each, much more ridiculous as it is than the theology of the poets. For Thales of Miletus, who took the lead in the study of natural <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, declared that water was the first principle of all things; for from water he says that all things are, and that into water all are resolved. And after him Anaximander, who came from the same Miletus, said that the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> was the first principle of all things; for that from this indeed all things are produced, and into this do all decay. Thirdly, Anaximenes&mdash; and he too was from Miletus&mdash; says that air is the first principle of all things; for he says that from this all things are produced, and into this all are resolved. Heraclitus and Hippasus, from Metapontus, say that fire is the first principle of all things; for from fire all things proceed, and in fire do all things terminate. Anaxagoras of Clazomen&aelig; said that the homogeneous parts are the first principles of all things. Archelaus, the son of Apollodorus, an Athenian, says that the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> air and its density and rarity are the first principle of all things. All these, forming a succession from Thales, followed the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> called by themselves physical.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Opinions of Pythagoras and Epicurus</h2>

<p>Then, in regular succession from another starting-point, Pythagoras the Samian, son of Mnesarchus, calls numbers, with their proportions and harmonies, and the elements composed of both, the first principles; and he includes also unity and the indefinite binary.  <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, an Athenian, the son of Neocles, says that the first principles of the things that exist are bodies perceptible by reason, admitting no vacuity,  unbegotten, indestructible, which can neither be broken, nor admit of any formation of their parts, nor alteration, and are therefore perceptible by reason. Empedocles of Agrigentum,  son of Meton, maintained that there were four elements&mdash; fire, air, water, earth; and two elementary powers &mdash; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>,  of which the former is a power of union, the latter of separation. You see, then, the confusion of those who are considered by you to have been wise men, whom you assert to be your teachers of religion: some of them declaring that water is the first principle of all things; others, air others, fire; and others, some other of these fore-mentioned elements; and all of them employing persuasive arguments for the establishment of their own <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and attempting to prove their own peculiar dogma to be the most valuable. These things were said by them. How then, you men of Greece, can it be safe for those who desire to be saved, to fancy that they can learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion from these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, who were neither able so to convince themselves as to prevent sectarian wrangling with one another, and not to appear definitely opposed to one another's opinions?</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. Opinions of Plato and Aristotle</h2>

<p>But possibly those who are unwilling to give up the ancient and inveterate <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, maintain that they have received the doctrine of their religion not from those who have now been mentioned, but from those who are esteemed among them as the most renowned and finished <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Aristotle. For these, they say, have learned the perfect and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. But I would be glad to ask, first of all, from those who say so, from whom they say that these men have learned this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; for it is impossible that men who have not learned these so great and divine matters from some who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them, should either themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, or be able correctly to teach others; and, in the second place, I think we ought to examine the opinions even of these sages. For we shall see whether each of these does not manifestly contradict the other. But if we find that even they do not agree with each other, I think it is easy to see clearly that they too are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, with the air of one that has descended from above, and has accurately ascertained and seen all that is in heaven, says that the most high God exists in a fiery substance.  But Aristotle, in a book addressed to Alexander of Macedon, giving a compendious explanation of his own <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, clearly and manifestly overthrows the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, saying that God does not exist in a fiery substance: but inventing, as a fifth substance, some kind of &aelig;therial and unchangeable body, says that God exists in it. Thus, at least, he wrote: <q>Not, as some of those who have erred regarding the Deity say, that God exists in a fiery substance.</q> Then, as if he were not satisfied with this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, he further, for the sake of proving what he says about the &aelig;therial body, cites as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> him whom <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had banished from his republic as a liar, and as being an imitator of the images of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> at three removes,  for so <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> calls Homer; for he wrote: <q>Thus at least did Homer speak,  'And Zeus obtained the wide heaven in the air and the clouds,' </q> wishing to make his own opinion appear more worthy of credit by the testimony of Homer; not being aware that if he used Homer as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to prove that he spoke <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, many of his tenets would be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> untrue. For Thales of Miletus, who was the founder of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> among them, taking occasion from him,  will contradict his first opinions about first principles. For Aristotle himself, having said that God and matter are the first principles of all things, Thales, the eldest of all their sages, says that water is the first principle of the things that exist; for he says that all things are from water, and that all things are resolved into water. And he conjectures this, first, from the fact that the seed of all living creatures, which is their first principle, is moist; and secondly, because all plants grow and bear fruit in moisture, but when deprived of moisture, wither. Then, as if not satisfied with his conjectures, he cites Homer as a most trustworthy testimony, who speaks thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Ocean, who is the origin of all.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>May not Thales, then, very fairly say to him, <q>What is the reason, Aristotle, why you give heed to Homer, as if he spoke <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when you wish to demolish the opinions of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>; but when you promulgate an opinion contrary to ours, you think Homer untruthful?</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Further disagreements between Plato and Aristotle</h2>

<p>And that these very wonderful sages of yours do not even agree in other respects, can be easily learned from this. For while <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says that there are three first principles of all things, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and matter, and form,&mdash; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the maker of all; and matter, which is the subject of the first production of all that is produced, and affords to God opportunity for His workmanship; and form, which is the type of each of the things  produced&mdash;Aristotle makes no mention at all of form as a first principle, but says that there are two, God and matter. And again, while <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says that the highest God and the ideas exist in the first place of the highest heavens, and in fixed sphere, Aristotle says that, next to the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there are, not ideas, but certain gods, who can be perceived by the mind. Thus, then, do they differ concerning things heavenly. So that one can see that they not only are unable to understand our earthly matters, but also, being at variance among themselves regarding these things, they will appear unworthy of credit when they treat of things heavenly. And that even their doctrine regarding the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as it now is does not harmonize, is manifest from what has been said by each of them concerning it. For <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says that it is of three parts, having the faculty of reason, of affection, and of appetite.  But Aristotle says that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not so comprehensive as to include also corruptible parts, but only reason. And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> loudly maintains that <q>the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>.</q> But Aristotle, naming it <q>the actuality,</q>  would have it to be mortal, not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. And the former says it is always in motion; but Aristotle says that it is immoveable, since it must itself precede all motion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Inconsistencies of Plato's doctrine</h2>

<p>But in these things they are convicted of thinking in contradiction to each other. And if any one will accurately criticise their writings, they have chosen to abide in harmony not even with their own opinions. <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, at any rate, at one time says that there are three first principles of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>&mdash; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and matter, and form; but at another time four, for he adds the universal <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And again, when he has already said that matter is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>,  he afterwards says that it is produced; and when he has first given to form its peculiar rank as a first principle, and has asserted for its self-subsistence, he afterwards says that this same thing is among the things perceived by the understanding. Moreover, having first declared that everything that is made is mortal  he afterwards states that some of the things that are made are indestructible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. What, then, is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why those who have been esteemed wise among you disagree not only with one another but also with themselves? Manifestly, their unwillingness to learn from those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and their desire to attain accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things heavenly by their own <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> excess of wisdom though they were able to understand not even earthly matters. Certainly some of your <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> say that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in us; others, that it is around us. For not even in this did they choose to agree with one another, but, distributing, as it were, <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in various ways among themselves, they thought fit to wrangle and dispute with one another even about the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For some of them say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is fire, and some that it is the air; and others, the mind; and others, motion; and others, an exhalation; and certain others say that it is a power flowing from the stars; and others, number capable of motion; and others, a generating water. And a wholly confused and inharmonious opinion has prevailed among them, which only in this one respect appears praiseworthy to those who can form a right judgment, that they have been anxious to convict one another of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Antiquity, inspiration, and harmony of Christian teachers</h2>

<p>Since therefore it is impossible to learn anything <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> concerning religion from your teachers, who by their mutual disagreement have furnished you with sufficient <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, I consider it reasonable to recur to our progenitors, who both in point of time have by a great way the precedence of your teachers, and who have taught us nothing from their own private fancy, nor differed with one another, nor attempted to overturn one another's positions, but without wrangling and contention received from God the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which also they taught to us. For neither by nature nor by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception is it possible for men to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> things so great and divine, but by the gift which then descended from above upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, who had no need of rhetorical art,  nor of uttering anything in a contentious or quarrelsome manner, but to present themselves pure  to the energy of the Divine Spirit, in order that the divine plectrum itself, descending from heaven, and using righteous men as an instrument like a harp or lyre, might reveal to us the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things divine and heavenly. Wherefore, as if with one mouth and one tongue, they have in succession, and in harmony with one another, taught us both concerning <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the creation of the world, and the formation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and concerning the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the judgment which is to be after this life, and concerning all things which it is needful for us to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and thus in various times and places have afforded us the divine instruction. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The antiquity of Moses proved by Greek writers</h2>

<p>I will begin, then, with our first <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and lawgiver, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; first explaining the times in which he lived, on authorities which among you are worthy of all credit. For I do not propose to prove these things only from our own divine histories, which as yet you are unwilling to credit on account of the inveterate <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of your forefathers, but also from your own histories, and such, too, as have no reference to our worship, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, of all your teachers, whether sages, poets, historians, <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, or lawgivers, by far the oldest, as the Greek histories show us, was <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who was our first religious teacher.  For in the times of Ogyges and Inachus, whom some of your poets suppose to have been earth-born,  <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is mentioned as the leader and ruler of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation. For in this way he is mentioned both by Polemon in the first book of his <em>Hellenics</em>, and by Apion son of Posidonius in his book against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and in the fourth book of his history, where he says that during the reign of Inachus over Argos the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> revolted from Amasis king of the Egyptians, and that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> led them. And Ptolem&aelig;us the Mendesian, in relating the history of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, concurs in all this. And those who write the Athenian history, Hellanicus and Philochorus (the author of <em>The Attic History</em>), Castor and Thallus and Alexander Polyhistor, and also the very well informed writers on Jewish affairs, <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> and <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, have mentioned <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> as a very ancient and time-honoured prince of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, certainly, desiring to signify even by the title of his work the antiquity and age of the history, wrote thus at the commencement of the history: <q>The Jewish antiquities  of <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Flavius Josephus</a>,</q>&mdash; signifying the oldness of the history by the word <q>antiquities.</q> And your most renowned historian Diodorus, who employed thirty whole years in epitomizing the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>, and who, as he himself wrote, travelled over both Asia and <a href="../cathen/05607b.htm">Europe</a> for the sake of great accuracy, and thus became an eye-<a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of very many things, wrote forty entire books of his own history. And he in the first book, having said that he had learned from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was an ancient lawgiver, and even the first, wrote of him in these very words: <q>For subsequent to the ancient manner of living in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> which gods and heroes are fabled to have regulated, they say that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>  first persuaded the people to use written <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and to live by them; and he is recorded to have been a man both great of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of great faculty in social matters.</q> Then, having proceeded a little further, and wishing to mention the ancient lawgivers, he mentions <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> first. For he spoke in these words: <q>Among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> they say that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> ascribed his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>  to that God who is called Jehovah, whether because they judged it a marvellous and quite divine conception which promised to benefit a multitude of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, or because they were of opinion that the people would be the more <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> when they contemplated the majesty and power of those who were said to have invented the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. And they say that Sasunchis was the second <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> legislator, a man of excellent understanding. And the third, they say, was Sesonchosis the king, who not only performed the most brilliant military exploits of any in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, but also consolidated that warlike race by legislation. And the fourth lawgiver, they say, was Bocchoris the king, a wise and surpassingly skilful man. And after him it is said that Amasis the king acceded to the government, whom they relate to have regulated all that pertains to the rulers of provinces, and to the general administration of the government of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. And they say that Darius, the father of Xerxes, was the sixth who legislated for the Egyptians.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Training and inspiration of Moses</h2> 

<p>These things, you men of Greece, have been recorded in writing concerning the antiquity of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by those who were not of our religion; and they said that they learned all these things from the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, among whom <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was not only born, but also was thought worthy of partaking of all the education of the Egyptians, on account of his being adopted by the king's daughter as her son; and for the same reason was thought worthy of great attention, as the wisest of the historians relate, who have chosen to record his life and actions, and the rank of his descent, &mdash; I speak of <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> and <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>. For these, in their narration of the history of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, say that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was sprung from the race of the Chald&aelig;ans, and that he was born in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> when his forefathers had migrated on account of famine from <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a> to that country; and him God chose to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> on account of his exceeding <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and judged him worthy to become the leader and lawgiver of his own race, when He thought it right that the people of the Hebrews should return out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> into their own land. To him first did God communicate that divine and prophetic gift which in those days descended upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, and him also did He first  furnish that he might be our teacher in religion, and then after him the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who both obtained the same gift as he, and taught us the same doctrines concerning the same subjects. These we assert to have been our teachers, who taught us nothing from their own <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> conception, but from the gift vouchsafed to them by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from above.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Heathen oracles testify of Moses</h2>

<p>But as you do not see the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of giving up the ancient <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of your forefathers in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to these teachers [of ours], what teachers of your own do you maintain to have lived worthy of credit in the matter of religion? For, as I have frequently said, it is impossible that those who have not themselves learned these so great and divine things from such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> as are acquainted with them, should either themselves <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, or be able rightly to teach others. Since, therefore, it has been sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the opinions of your <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are obviously full of all <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and deceit, having now perhaps wholly abandoned the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> as formerly you abandoned the poets, you will turn to the deceit of the oracles; for in this style I have heard some speaking. Therefore I think it fit to tell you at this step in our discourse what I formerly heard among you concerning their utterances. For when one inquired at your oracle&mdash; it is your own story&mdash; what religious men had at any time happened to live, you say that the oracle answered thus: <q>Only the Chald&aelig;ans have obtained wisdom, and the Hebrews, who worship God Himself, the self-begotten King.</q></p>

<p>Since, therefore, you think that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can be learned from your oracles, when you read the histories and what has been written regarding the life of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by those who do not belong to our religion, and when you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were descended from the race of the Chald&aelig;ans and Hebrews, do not think that anything incredible has taken place if a man sprung from a godly line, and who lived worthily of the godliness of his fathers, was chosen by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be honoured with this great gift and to be set forth as the first of all the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Antiquity of Moses proved</h2>

<p>And I think it necessary also to consider the times in which your <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> lived, that you may see that the time which produced them for you is very recent, and also short. For thus you will be able easily to recognise also the antiquity of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. But lest, by a complete survey of the periods, and by the use of a greater number of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, I should seem to be prolix, I thing it may be sufficiently demonstrated from the following. For Socrates was the teacher of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> of Aristotle. Now these men flourished in the time of Philip and Alexander of Macedon, in which time also the Athenian orators flourished, as the Philippics of Demosthenes plainly show us. And those who have narrated the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of Alexander sufficiently prove that during his reign Aristotle associated with him. From all manner of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, then, it is easy to see that the history of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> is by far more ancient than all profane  histories. And, besides, it is fit that you recognise this fact also, that nothing has been accurately recorded by Greeks before the era of the Olympiads, and that there is no ancient work which makes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> any action of the Greeks or Barbarians. But before that period <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> only the history of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, which he wrote in the Hebrew character by the divine inspiration. For the Greek character was not yet in use, as the teachers of language themselves prove, telling us that Cadmus first brought the letters from <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, and communicated them to the Greeks. And your first of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, testifies that they were a recent discovery. For in the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>  he wrote that Solon, the wisest of the wise men, on his return from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, said to Critias that he had heard this from a very aged <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, who said to him, <q>O Solon, Solon, you Greeks are ever children, and aged Greek there is none.</q> Then again he said, <q>You are all youths in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for you hold no ancient opinion derived through remote tradition, nor any system of instruction hoary with time; but all these things escape your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, because for many generations the posterity of these ancient ages died mute, not having the use of letters.</q> It is fit, therefore, that you understand that it is the fact that every history has been written in these recently-discovered Greek letters; and if any one would make mention of old poets, or legislators, or historians, or <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, or orators, he will find that they wrote their own works in the Greek character.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. History of the Septuagint</h2>

<p>But if any one says that the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were also written in the Greek character, let him read profane histories, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Ptolemy, king of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, when he had built the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, and by gathering books from every quarter had filled it, then learned that very ancient histories written in Hebrew happened to be carefully preserved; and wishing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their contents, he sent for seventy wise men from Jerusalem, who were acquainted with both the Greek and Hebrew language, and appointed them to translate the books; and that in freedom from all disturbance  they might the more speedily complete the translation, he ordered that there should be constructed, not in the city itself, but seven stadia off (where the Pharos was built), as many little cots as there were translators, so that each by himself might complete his own translation; and enjoined upon those officers who were appointed to this duty, to afford them all attendance, but to prevent communication with one another, in order that the accuracy of the translation might be discernible even by their agreement. And when he ascertained that the seventy men had not only given the same meaning, but had employed the same words, and had failed in agreement with one another not even to the extent of one word; but had written the same things, and concerning the same things, he was struck with amazement, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the translation had been written by divine power, and perceived that the men were worthy of all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, as beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and with many gifts ordered them to return to their own country. And having, as was natural, marvelled at the books, and concluded them to be divine, he <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> them in that <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a>. These things, you men of Greece, are no fable, nor do we narrate fictions; but we ourselves having been in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, saw the remains of the little cots at the Pharos still preserved, and having heard these things from the inhabitants, who had received them as part of their country's tradition,  we now tell to you what you can also learn from others, and specially from those wise and esteemed men who have written of these things, <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a> and <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>, and many others. But if any of those who are wont to be forward in contradiction should say that these books do not belong to us, but to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and should assert that we in vain profess to have learned our religion from them, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, as he may from those very things which are written in these books, that not to them, but to us, does the doctrine of them refer. That the books relating to our religion are to this day preserved among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, has been a work of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> on our behalf; for lest, by producing them out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we should give occasion to those who wish to <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> us to charge us with fraud, we demand that they be produced from the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that from the very books still preserved among them it might clearly and evidently appear, that the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which were written by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men for instruction pertain to us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. A warning appeal to the Greeks</h2>

<p>It is therefore necessary, you Greeks, that you contemplate the things that are to be, and consider the judgment which is predicted by all, not only by the godly, but also by those who are irreligious, that you do not without investigation commit yourselves to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of your fathers, nor suppose that if they themselves have been in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and have transmitted it to you, that this which they have taught you is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but looking to the danger of so terrible a mistake, inquire and investigate carefully into those things which are, as you say, spoken of even by your own teachers. For even unwillingly they were on your account forced to say many things by the Divine regard for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, especially those of them who were in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and profited by the godliness of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and his ancestry. For I think that some of you, when you read even carelessly the history of Diodorus, and of those others who wrote of these things, cannot fail to see that both Orpheus, and Homer, and Solon, who wrote the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, and Pythagoras, and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and some others, when they had been in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and had taken advantage of the history of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, afterwards published doctrines concerning the gods quite contrary to those which formerly they had erroneously promulgated.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Testimony of Orpheus to monotheism</h2>

<p>At all events, we must remind you what Orpheus, who was, as one might say, your first teacher of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, latterly addressed to his son Mus&aelig;us, and to the other legitimate auditors, concerning the one and only God. And he spoke thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>I speak to those who lawfully may hear:<br>All others, you profane, now close the doors,<br>And, O Mus&aelig;us! Hearken to me,<br>Who offspring art of the light-bringing moon:<br>The words I utter now are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> indeed;<br>And if you former thoughts of mine hast seen,<br>Let them not rob you of the blessed life,<br>But rather turn the depths of your own heart<br>Unto the place where light and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> dwell.<br>Take the word divine to guide your steps,<br>And walking well in the straight certain path,<br>Look to the one and universal King&mdash; <br>One, self-begotten, and the only One,<br>Of whom all things and we ourselves are sprung.<br>All things are open to His piercing gaze,<br>While He Himself is still invisible.<br>Present in all His works, though still unseen,<br>He gives to mortals <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> out of good,<br>Sending both chilling <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and tearful griefs;<br>And other than the great King there is none.<br>The clouds for ever settle round His throne,<br>And mortal eyeballs in mere mortal eyes<br>Are weak, to see Jove reigning over all.<br>He sits established in the brazen heavens<br>Upon His golden throne; under His feet<br>He treads the earth, and stretches His right hand<br>To all the ends of ocean, and around<br>Tremble the mountain ranges and the streams,<br>The depths, too, of the blue and hoary sea.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>  And again, in some other place he says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There is one Zeus alone, one sun, one <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,<br>One Bacchus; and in all things but one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;<br>Nor of all these as diverse let me speak.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And when he swears he says:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Now I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you by the highest heaven,<br>The work of the great <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the only wise;<br>And I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you by the Father's voice.<br>Which first He uttered when He established<br>The whole world by His counsel.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>What does he mean by <q>I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you by the Father's voice, which first He uttered?</q> It is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> which he here names <q>the voice,</q> by whom heaven and earth and the whole creation were made, as the divine prophecies of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men teach us; and these he himself also paid some attention to in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and understood that all creation was made by the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>; and therefore, after he says, <q>I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you by the Father's voice, which first He uttered,</q> he adds this besides, <q>when by His counsel He established the whole world.</q> Here he calls the Word <q>voice,</q> for the sake of the poetical metre. And that this is so, is manifest from the fact, that a little further on, where the metre permits him, he names it <q>Word.</q> For he said:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Take the <em>Word</em> divine to guide your steps.</q></p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 16. Testimony of the Sibyl</h2>

<p>We must also mention what the ancient and exceedingly remote Sibyl, whom <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Aristophanes, and others besides, mention as a prophetess, taught you in her oracular verses concerning one only God. And she speaks thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There is one only unbegotten <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,<br>Omnipotent, invisible, most high,<br>All-seeing, but Himself seen by no flesh.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Then elsewhere thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>But we have strayed from the Immortal's ways,<br>And worship with a dull and senseless mind<br>Idols, the workmanship of our own hands,<br>And images and figures of dead men.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again somewhere else:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Blessed shall be those men upon the earth<br>Who shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the great God before all else,<br>Blessing Him when they eat and when they drink;<br>Trusting it, this their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> alone.<br>Who shall abjure all shrines which they may see,<br>All altars and vain figures of dumb stones,<br>Worthless and stained with blood of animals,<br>And <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of the four-fooled tribes,<br>Beholding the great <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of One God.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>These are the Sibyl's words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Testimony of Homer</h2>

<p>And the poet Homer, using the license of poetry, and rivalling the original opinion of Orpheus regarding the plurality of the gods, mentions, indeed, several gods in a mythical style, lest he should seem to sing in a different strain from the poem of Orpheus, which he so distinctly proposed to rival, that even in the first line of his poem he indicated the relation he held to him. For as Orpheus in the beginning of his poem had said, <q>O goddess, sing the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of Demeter, who brings the goodly fruit,</q> Homer began thus, <q>O goddess, sing the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of Achilles, son of Peleus,</q> preferring, as it seems to me, even to violate the poetical metre in his first line, than that he should seem not to have remembered before all else the names of the gods. But shortly after he also clearly and explicitly presents his own opinion regarding one God only, somewhere  saying to Achilles by the mouth of Ph&oelig;nix, <q>Not though God Himself were to promise that He would peel off my old age, and give me the rigour of my youth,</q> where he indicates by the pronoun the real and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. And somewhere  he makes Ulysses address the host of the Greeks thus: <q>The rule of many is not a good thing; let there be one ruler.</q> And that the rule of many is not a good thing, but on the contrary an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he proposed to evince by fact, recounting the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which took place on account of the multitude of rulers, and the fights and factions, and their mutual counterplots. For monarchy <em>is</em> free from contention. So far the poet Homer.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Testimony of Sophocles</h2>

<p>And if it is needful that we add testimonies concerning one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even from the dramatists, hear even Sophocles speaking thus:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> there is but one,<br>Who made the heavens and the broad earth beneath,<br>The glancing waves of ocean and the winds<br>But many of us mortals <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> in heart,<br>And set up for a solace in our woes<br>Images of the gods in stone and wood,<br>Or figures carved in brass or ivory,<br>And, furnishing for these our handiworks,<br>Both <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and rite magnificent,<br>We think that thus we do a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> work.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, then, Sophocles.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Testimony of Pythagoras</h2>

<p>And Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchus, who expounded the doctrines of his own <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> by means of <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, as those who have written his life show, himself seems to have entertained thoughts about the unity of God not unworthy of his foreign residence in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. For when he says that unity is the first principle of all things, and that it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all good, he teaches by an allegory that God is one, and alone.  And that this is so, is evident from his saying that  unity and one differ widely from one another. For he says that unity belongs to the class of things perceived by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but that one belongs to numbers. And if you desire to see a clearer <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the opinion of Pythagoras concerning one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hear his own opinion, for he spoke as follows: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is one; and He Himself does not, as some suppose, exist outside the world, but in it, He being wholly present in the whole circle, and beholding all generations; being the regulating ingredient of all the ages, and the administrator of His own powers and works, the first principle of all things, the light of heaven, and Father of all, the intelligence and animating <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, the movement of all orbits.</q> Thus, then, Pythagoras.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Testimony of Plato</h2>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, though he accepted, as is likely, the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> regarding one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he learned while in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, yet fearing, on account of what had befallen Socrates, lest he also should raise up some Anytus or Meletus against himself, who should accuse him before the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, and say, <q><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is doing harm, and making himself mischievously busy, not acknowledging the gods recognised by the state;</q> in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the hemlock-juice, contrives an elaborate and ambiguous discourse concerning the gods, furnishing by his treatise gods to those who wish them, and none for those who are differently disposed, as may readily be seen from his own statements. For when he has laid down that everything that is made is mortal, he afterwards says that the gods were made. If, then, he would have God and matter to be the origin of all things, manifestly it is inevitably necessary to say that the gods were made of matter; but if of matter, out of which he said that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> also had its origin, he leaves right-thinking <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to consider what kind of beings the gods should be thought who are produced out of matter. For, for this very reason did he say that matter was <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>,  that he might not seem to say that God is the creator of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And regarding the gods who were made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he said this: <q>Gods of gods, of whom I am the creator.</q> And he manifestly held the correct opinion concerning the really existing God. For having heard in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> that God had said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when He was about to send him to the Hebrews, <q>I am that I am,</q>  he understood that God had not mentioned to him His own proper name.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. The namelessness of God</h2>

<p>For God cannot be called by any proper name, for names are given to mark out and distinguish their subject-matters, because these are many and diverse; but neither did any one exist before God who could give Him a name, nor did He Himself think it right to name Himself, seeing that He is one and unique, as He Himself also by His own <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> testifies, when He says, <q>I God am the first,</q> and after this, <q>And beside me there is no other God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012548"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;44:6</a></span> On this account, then, as I before said, God did not, when He sent <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to the Hebrews, mention any name, but by a participle He <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> teaches them that He is the one and only God. <q>For,</q> says He; <q>I am the Being;</q> manifestly contrasting Himself, <q>the Being,</q> with those who are not,  that those who had hitherto been deceived might see that they were attaching themselves, not to beings, but to those who had no being. Since, therefore, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the first men remembered the old delusion of their forefathers, whereby the misanthropic <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> contrived to deceive them when he said to them, <q>If you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> me in transgressing the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you shall be as gods,</q> calling those gods which had no being, in order that men, supposing that there were other gods in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they themselves could become gods. On this account He said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>I am the Being,</q> that by the participle <q>being</q> He might teach the difference between God who is and those who are not.  Men, therefore, having been duped by the deceiving <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, and having dared to disobey <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were cast out of Paradise, remembering the name of gods, but no longer being taught by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> that there are no other gods. For it was not just that they who did not keep the first commandment, which it was easy to keep, should any longer be taught, but should rather be driven to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment. Being therefore banished from Paradise, and thinking that they were expelled on account of their disobedience only, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it was also because they had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of gods which did not exist, they gave the name of gods even to the men who were afterwards born of themselves. This first false fancy, therefore, concerning gods, had its origin with the father of lies. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the false opinion about the plurality of gods was burdening the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man like some disease, and wishing to remove and eradicate it, appeared first to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and said to him, <q>I am He who is.</q> For it was necessary, I think, that he who was to be the ruler and leader of the Hebrew people should first of all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the living God. Wherefore, having appeared to him first, as it was possible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to appear to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, He said to him, <q>I am He who is;</q> then, being about to  send him to the Hebrews, He further orders him to say, <q>He who is has sent me to you.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Studied ambiguity Plato</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> accordingly having learned this in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and being greatly taken with what was said about one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did indeed consider it unsafe to mention the name of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, on account of his teaching the doctrine of one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for he dreaded the Areopagus; but what is very well expressed by him in his elaborate treatise, the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em>, he has written in exact correspondence with what <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said regarding <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though he has done so, not as if he had learned it from him, but as if he were expressing his own opinion. For he said, <q>In my opinion, then, we must first define what that is which exists <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>, and has no generation,  and what that is which is always being generated, but never really is.</q> Does not this, you men of Greece, seem to those who are able to understand the matter to be one and the same thing, saving only the difference of the article? For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, <q> <em>He</em> who is,</q> and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, <q>That which is.</q> But either of the expressions seems to apply to the ever-existent God. For He is the only one who <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> exists, and has no generation. What, then, that other thing is which is contrasted with the ever-existent, and of which he said, <q>And what that is which is always being generated, but never really is,</q> we must attentively consider. For we shall find him clearly and evidently saying that He who is unbegotten is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but that those that are begotten and made are generated and perish &mdash; as he said of the same class, <q>gods of gods, of whom I am maker</q>&mdash; for he speaks in the following words: <q>In my opinion, then, we must first define what that is which is always existent and has no birth, and what that is which is always being generated but never really is. The former, indeed, which is apprehended by reflection combined with reason, always exists in the same way;  while the latter, on the other hand, is conjectured by opinion formed by the perception of the senses unaided by reason, since it never really is, but is coming into being and perishing.</q> These expressions declare to those who can rightly understand them the death and destruction of the gods that have been brought into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">being</a>. And I think it necessary to attend to this also, that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> never names him the creator, but the fashioner  of the gods, although, in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, there is considerable difference between these two. For the creator creates the creature by his own capability and power, being in need of nothing else; but the fashioner frames his production when he has received from matter the capability for his work.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Plato's self-contradiction</h2>

<p>But, perhaps, some who are unwilling to abandon the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, will say that to these fashioned gods the maker said, <q>Since you have been produced, you are not <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, nor at all, imperishable; yet shall you not perish nor succumb to the fatality of death, because you have obtained my will,  which is a still greater and mightier bond.</q> Here <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the adherents of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, introduces his <q>maker</q> uttering words which contradict himself. For having formerly stated that he said that everything which is produced is perishable, he now introduces him saying the very opposite; and he does not see that it is thus absolutely impossible for him to escape the charge of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. For he either at first uttered what is false when he said that everything which is produced is perishable, or now, when he propounds the very opposite to what he had formerly said. For if, according to his former definition, it is absolutely necessary that every created thing be perishable, how can he consistently make that possible which is absolutely impossible? So that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> seems to grant an empty and impossible prerogative to his <q>maker,</q> when he propounds that those who were once perishable because made from matter should again, by his intervention, become imperishable and enduring. For it is quite natural that the power of matter, which, according to <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> opinion, is uncreated, and contemporary and co&aelig;val with the maker, should resist his will. For he who has not created has no power, in respect of that which is uncreated, so that it is not possible that it (matter), being free, can be controlled by any external necessity. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> himself, in consideration of this, has written thus: <q>It is necessary to affirm that God cannot suffer <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Agreement of Plato and Homer</h2>

<p>How, then, does <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> banish Homer from his republic, since, in the embassy to Achilles, he represents Ph&oelig;nix as saying to Achilles, <q>Even the gods themselves are not inflexible,</q>  though Homer said this not of the king and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonic</a> maker of the gods, but of some of the multitude whom the Greeks esteem as gods, as one can gather from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> saying, <q>gods of gods?</q> For Homer, by that golden chain,  refers all power and might to the one highest  God. And the rest of the gods, he said, were so far distant from his divinity, that he thought fit to name them even along with men. At least he introduces Ulysses saying of Hector to Achilles, <q>He is raging terribly, trusting in Zeus, and values neither men nor gods.</q>  In this passage Homer seems to me without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> to have learned in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, like <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, concerning the one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and plainly and openly to declare this, that he who trusts in the really existent God makes no account of those that do not exist. For thus the poet, in another passage, and employing another but equivalent word, to wit, a pronoun, made use of the same participle employed by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> to designate the really existent <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, concerning whom <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> said, <q>What that is which always exists, and has no birth.</q> For not without a double sense does this expression of Ph&oelig;nix seem to have been used: <q>Not even if God Himself were to promise me, that, having burnished off my old age, He should set me forth in the flower of youth.</q> For the pronoun <q>Himself</q> signifies the really existing God. For thus, too, the oracle which was given to you concerning the Chald&aelig;ans and Hebrews signifies. For when some one inquired what men had ever lived godly, you say the answer was:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Only the Chald&aelig;ans and the Hebrews found wisdom,<br>Worshipping God Himself, the unbegotten King.</q></p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 25. Plato's knowledge of God's eternity</h2>

<p>How, then, does <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> blame Homer for saying that the gods are not inflexible, although, as is obvious from the expressions used, Homer said this for a useful purpose? For it is the property of those who expect to obtain mercy by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, to cease from and repent of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For those who think that the Deity is inflexible, are by no means moved to abandon their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, since they suppose that they will derive no benefit from repentance. How, then, does <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> condemn the poet Homer for saying, <q>Even the gods themselves are not inflexible,</q> and yet himself represent the maker of the gods as so easily turned, that he sometimes declares the gods to be mortal, and at other times declares the same to be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>? And not only concerning them, but also concerning matter, from which, as he says, it is necessary that the created gods have been produced, he sometimes says that it is uncreated, and at other times that it is created; and yet he does not see that he himself, when he says that the maker of the gods is so easily turned, is convicted of having fallen into the very <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> for which he blames Homer, though Homer said the very opposite concerning the maker of the gods. For he said that he spoke thus of himself:&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>For ne'er my promise shall deceive, or fail,<br>Or be recall'd, if with a nod confirm'd.</q> </p></blockquote>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, as it seems, unwillingly entered not these strange dissertations concerning the gods, for he feared those who were attached to <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>. And whatever he thinks fit to tell of all that he had learned from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> concerning one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he preferred delivering in a mystical style, so that those who desired to be worshippers of God might have an inkling of his own opinion. For being charmed with that saying of God to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <q>I am the really existing,</q> and accepting with a great deal of thought the brief participial expression, he understood that God desired to signify to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and therefore said, <q>I am the really existing;</q> for this word <q>existing</q> expresses not one time only, but the three&mdash; the past, the present, and the future. For when <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> says, <q>and which never really is,</q> he uses the verb <q>is</q> of time indefinite. For the word <q>never</q> is not spoken, as some suppose, of the past, but of the future time. And this has been accurately understood even by profane writers. And therefore, when <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> wished, as it were, to interpret to the uninitiated what had been <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> expressed by the participle concerning the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he employed the following language: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> indeed, as the old tradition runs, includes the beginning, and end, and middle of all things.</q> In this sentence he plainly and obviously names the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> <q>the old tradition,</q> fearing, through dread of the hemlock-cup, to mention the name of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; for he understood that the teaching of the man was hateful to the Greeks; and he clearly enough indicates <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> by the antiquity of the tradition. And we have sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from Diodorus and the rest of the historians, in the foregoing chapters, that the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> is not only old, but even the first. For Diodorus says that he was the first of all lawgivers; the letters which belong to the Greeks, and which they employed in the writing of their histories, having not yet been discovered.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Plato indebted to the prophets</h2>

<p>And let no one wonder that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For you will find him <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> referring the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of realities to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, next in order after the really existent God. For, discoursing in the <em>Tim&aelig;us</em> about certain first principles, he wrote thus: <q>This we lay down as the first principle of fire and the other bodies,  proceeding according to probability and necessity. But the first principles of these again God above <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and whosoever among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is beloved of Him.</q>  And what men does he think beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>? For their prophecies he read, and, having learned from them the doctrine of the judgment, he thus proclaims it in the first book of the <em>Republic</em>: <q>When a man begins to think he is soon to die, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> invades him, and concern about things which had never before entered his head. And those stories about what goes on in Hades, which tell us that the man who has here been <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> must there be punished, though formerly ridiculed, now torment his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with apprehensions that they may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. And he, either through the feebleness of age, or even because he is now nearer to the things of the other world, views them more attentively. He becomes, therefore, full of apprehension and dread, and begins to call himself to account and to consider whether he has done any one an injury. And that man who finds in his life many iniquities, and who continually starts from his sleep as children do, lives in terror, and with a forlorn prospect. But to him who is conscious of no wrong-doing, sweet hope is the constant companion and good nurse of old age, as Pindar says.  For this, Socrates, he has elegantly expressed, that 'whoever leads a life of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, him sweet hope, the nurse of age, accompanies, cheering his heart, for she powerfully sways the changeful mind of mortals.' </q>  This <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> wrote in the first book of the <em>Republic</em>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. Plato's knowledge of the judgment</h2>

<p>And in the tenth book he plainly and manifestly wrote what he had learned from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> about the judgment, not as if he had learned it from them, but, on account of his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Greeks, as if he had heard it from a man who has been slain in battle&mdash; for this story he thought fit to invent&mdash; and who, when he was about to be buried on the twelfth day, and was lying on the funeral pile, came to life again, and described the other world. The following are his very words:  <q>For he said that he was present when one was asked by another person where the great Ardi&aelig;us was. This Ardi&aelig;us had been prince in a certain city of Pamphylia, and had killed his aged father and his elder brother, and done many other unhallowed <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as was reported. He said, then that the person who was asked said: He neither comes nor ever will come hither. For we saw, among other terrible sights, this also. When we were close to the mouth [of the pit], and were about to return to the upper air, and had suffered everything else, we suddenly beheld both him and others likewise, most of whom were tyrants. But there were also some private sinners who had committed great crimes. And these, when they thought they were to ascend, the mouth would not permit, but bellowed when any of those who were so incurably <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> attempted to ascend, unless they had paid the full penalty. Then fierce men, fiery to look at, stood close by, and hearing the din,  took some and led them away; but Ardi&aelig;us and the rest, having bound hand and foot, and striking their heads down, and flaying, they dragged to the road outside, tearing them with thorns, and signifying to those who were present the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their suffering these things, and that they were leading them away to cast them into Tartarus. Hence, he said, that amidst all their various fears, this one was the greatest, lest the mouth should bellow when they ascended, since if it were silent each one would most gladly ascend; and that the punishments and torments were such as these, and that, on the other hand, the rewards were the reverse of these.</q> Here <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> seems to me to have learned from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> not only the doctrine of the judgment, but also of the resurrection, which the Greeks refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For his saying that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is judged along with the body, proves nothing more clearly than that he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the doctrine of the resurrection. Since how could Ardi&aelig;us and the rest have undergone such punishment in Hades, had they left on earth the body, with its head, hands, feet, and skin? For certainly they will never say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has a head and hands, and feet and skin. But <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, having fallen in with the testimonies of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and having accepted what they teach concerning the resurrection of the body, teaches that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is judged in company with the body.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28. Homer's obligations to the sacred writers</h2>

<p>And not only <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, but Homer also, having received similar enlightenment in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, said that Tityus was in like manner punished. For Ulysses speaks thus to Alcinous when he is recounting his <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> by the shades of the dead: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There Tityus, large and long, in fetters bound,<br>O'erspread nine acres of infernal ground;<br>Two ravenous vultures, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> for their food,<br>Scream o'er the fiend, and riot in his blood,<br>Incessant gore the liver in his breast,<br>Th' <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> liver grows, and gives th' <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> feast.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>  For it is plain that it is not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the body, which has a liver. And in the same manner he has described both Sisyphus and Tantalus as enduring punishment with the body. And that Homer had been in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and introduced into his own poem much of what he there learned, Diodorus, the most esteemed of historians, plainly enough teaches us. For he said that when he was in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> he had learned that Helen, having received from Theon's wife, Polydamna, a drug, <q>lulling all sorrow and melancholy, and causing forgetfulness of all ills,</q>  brought it to Sparta. And Homer said that by making use of that drug Helen put an end to the lamentation of Menelaus, caused by the presence of Telemachus. And he also called Venus <q>golden,</q> from what he had seen in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. For he had seen the temple which in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> is called <q>the temple of golden Venus,</q> and the plain which is named <q>the plain of golden Venus.</q> And why do I now make mention of this? To show that the poet transferred to his own poem much of what is contained in the divine writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. And first he transferred what <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had related as the beginning of the creation of the world. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote thus: <q>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012567"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;1:1</a></span> then the sun, and the moon, and the stars. For having learned this in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and having been much taken with what <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had written in the Genesis of the world, he fabled that Vulcan had made in the shield of Achilles a kind of representation of the creation of the world. For he wrote thus: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>There he described the earth, the heaven, the sea,<br>The sun that rests not, and the moon full-orb'd;<br>There also, all the stars which round about,<br>As with a radiant frontlet, bind the skies.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And he contrived also that the garden of Alcinous should preserve the likeness of Paradise, and through this likeness he represented it as ever-blooming and full of all fruits. For thus he wrote: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Tall thriving trees confess'd the fruitful mould;<br>The reddening apple ripens here to gold.<br>Here the blue fig with luscious juice o'erflows,<br>With deeper red the full pomegranate glows;<br>The branch here bends beneath the weighty pear,<br>And verdant olives flourish round the year.<br>The balmy spirit of the western gale<br>Eternal breathes on fruits, untaught to fail;<br>Each dropping pear a following pear supplies,<br>On apples, figs on figs arise.<br>The same mild season gives the blooms to blow,<br>The buds to harden, and the fruits to grow.<br>Here order'd vines in equal ranks appear,<br>With all th' united labours of the year.<br>Some to unload the fertile branches run,<br>Some dry the blackening clusters in the sun,<br>Others to tread the liquid harvest join.<br>The groaning presses foam with floods of wine.<br>Here are the vines in early flower descry'd<br>Here grapes discoloured on the sunny side,<br>And there in autumn's richest purple dy'd.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Do not these words present a manifest and clear imitation of what the first <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said about Paradise? And if any one wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> something of the building of the tower by which the men of that day fancied they would obtain access to heaven, he will find a sufficiently exact allegorical imitation of this in what the poet has ascribed to Otus and Ephialtes. For of them he wrote thus: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>Proud of their strength, and more than mortal size,<br>The gods they challenge, and affect the skies.<br>Heav'd on Olympus tottering Ossa stood;<br>On Ossa, Pelion nods with all his wood.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And the same holds good regarding the enemy of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> who was cast out of heaven, whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Sacred Scriptures</a> call the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil</a>,  a name which he obtained from his first devilry against man; and if any one would attentively consider the matter, he would find that the poet, though he certainly never mentions the name of <q>the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> yet gives him a name from his wickedest action. For the poet, calling him Ate,  says that he was hurled from heaven by their god, just as if he had a distinct remembrance of the expressions which Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had uttered regarding him. He wrote thus in his own poem: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>And, seizing by her glossy locks<br>The goddess Ate, in his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> he swore<br>That never to the starry skies again,<br>And the Olympian heights, he would permit<br>The universal mischief to return.<br>Then, whirling her around, he cast her down<br>To earth. She, mingling with all works of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,<br>Caused many a pang to Jove.</q></p></blockquote>

<h2>Chapter 29. Origin of Plato's doctrine of form</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, too, when he says that form is the third original principle next to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and matter, has manifestly received this suggestion from no other source than from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, having learned, indeed, from the words of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the name of form, but not having at the same time been instructed by the initiated, that without mystic insight it is impossible to have any distinct <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the writings of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. For <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote that God had spoken to him regarding the tabernacle in the following words: <q>And you shall make for me according to all that I show you in the mount, the pattern of the tabernacle.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012574"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm">Exodus&nbsp;25</a></span> And again: <q>And you shall erect the tabernacle  according to the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall you make it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012575"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse9">Exodus&nbsp;25:9</a></span> And again, a little afterwards: <q>Thus then you shall make it according to the pattern which was showed to you in the mount.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012576"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse40">Exodus&nbsp;25:40</a></span> <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, then, reading these passages, and not receiving what was written with the suitable insight, thought that form had some kind of separate <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> before that which the senses perceive, and he often calls it the pattern of the things which are made, since the writing of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> spoke thus of the tabernacle: <q>According to the form showed to you in the mount, so shall you make it.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 30. Homer's knowledge of man's origin</h2>

<p>And he was obviously deceived in the same way regarding the earth and heaven and man; for he supposes that there are <q>ideas</q> of these. For as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote thus, <q>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,</q> and then subjoins this sentence, <q>And the earth was invisible and unfashioned,</q> he thought that it was the pre-existent earth which was spoken of in the words, <q>The earth was,</q> because <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> said, <q>And the earth was invisible and unfashioned;</q> and he thought that the earth, concerning which he says, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created the heaven and the earth,</q> was that earth which we perceive by the senses, and which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made according to the pre-existent form. And so also, of the heaven which was created, he thought that the heaven which was created&mdash; and which he also called the firmament&mdash; was that creation which the senses perceive; and that the heaven which the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> perceives is that other of which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said, <q>The heaven of heavens is the Lord's, but the earth has He given to the children of men.</q>  And so also concerning man: <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> first mentions the name of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and then after many other creations he makes mention of the formation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, saying, <q>And God made man, taking dust from the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012578"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;2:7</a></span> He thought, accordingly, that the man first so named <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before the man who was made, and that he who was formed of the earth was afterwards made according to the pre-existent form. And that man was formed of earth, Homer, too, having discovered from the ancient and divine history which says, <q>Dust you are, and unto dust shall you return,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012579"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> calls the lifeless body of Hector dumb clay. For in condemnation of Achilles dragging the corpse of Hector after death, he says somewhere: &mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>On the dumb clay he cast indignity,<br>Blinded with rage.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>And again, somewhere else,  he introduces Menelaus, thus addressing those who were not accepting Hector's challenge to single combat with becoming alacrity,&mdash; </p> <blockquote><p><q>To earth and water may you all return,</q>&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>resolving them in his violent rage into their original and pristine formation from earth. These things Homer and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, having learned in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> from the ancient histories, wrote in their own words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31. Further proof of Plato's acquaintance with Scripture</h2>

<p>For from what other source, if not from his reading the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, could <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> have derived the information he gives us, that Jupiter drives a winged chariot in heaven? For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this from the following expressions of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> about the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>: <q>And the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord went out from the house and rested on the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was over them above.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012582"><a href="../bible/eze011.htm#verse22">Ezekiel&nbsp;11:22</a></span> And borrowing this idea, the magniloquent <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> shouts aloud with vast assurance, <q>The great Jove, indeed, driving his winged chariot in heaven.</q> For from what other source, if not from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, did he learn this and so write? And whence did he receive the suggestion of his saying that God exists in a fiery substance? Was it not from the third book of the history of the Kings, where it is written, <q>The Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note012583"><a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19:11-12</a></span> But these things <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men must understand in a higher sense with profound and meditative insight. But <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, not attending to the words with the suitable insight, said that God exists in a fiery substance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32. Plato's doctrine of the heavenly gift</h2>

<p>And if any one will attentively consider the gift that descends from God on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, &mdash; which gift the sacred <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> call the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>&mdash;he shall find that this was announced under another name by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in the dialogue with Meno. For, fearing to name the gift of God <q>the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,</q> lest he should seem, by following the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, to be an enemy to the Greeks, he acknowledges, indeed, that it comes down from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet does not think fit to name it the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.  For so in the dialogue with Meno, concerning reminiscence, after he had put many questions regarding <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, whether it could be taught or whether it could not be taught, but must be gained by practice, or whether it could be attained neither by practice nor by learning, but was a natural gift in men, or whether it comes in some other way, he makes this declaration in these very words: <q>But if now through this whole dialogue we have conducted our inquiry and discussion aright, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> must be neither a natural gift, nor what one can receive by teaching, but comes to those to whom it does come by divine destiny.</q> These things, I think, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> having learned from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> regarding the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he has manifestly transferred to what he calls <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For as the sacred <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> say that one and the same spirit is divided into seven spirits, so he also, naming it one and the same <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, says this is divided into four <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; wishing by all means to avoid mention of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, but clearly declaring in a kind of allegory what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> said of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For to this effect he spoke in the dialogue with Meno towards the close: <q>From this reasoning, Meno, it appears that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> comes to those to whom it does come by a divine destiny. But we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> clearly about this, in what kind of way <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> comes to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, when, as a first step, we shall have set ourselves to investigate, as an independent inquiry, what <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> itself is.</q> You see how he calls only by the name of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the gift that descends from above; and yet he counts it worthy of inquiry, whether it is right that this [gift] be called <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or some other thing, fearing to name it openly the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, lest he should seem to be following the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33. Plato's idea of the beginning of time drawn from Moses</h2>

<p>And from what source did <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> draw the information that time was created along with the heavens? For he wrote thus: <q>Time, accordingly, was created along with the heavens; in order that, coming into being together, they might also be together dissolved, if ever their dissolution should take place.</q> Had he not learned this from the divine history of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>? For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the creation of time had received its original constitution from days and months and years. Since, then, the first day which was created along with the heavens constituted the beginning of all time (for thus <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> wrote, <q>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,</q> and then immediately subjoins, <q>And one day was made,</q> as if he would designate the whole of time by one part of it), <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> names the day <q>time,</q> lest, if he mentioned the <q>day,</q> he should seem to lay himself open to the accusation of the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, that he was completely adopting the expressions of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. And from what source did he derive what he has written regarding the dissolution of the heavens? Had he not learned this, too, from the sacred <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and did he not think that this was their doctrine?</p>

<h2>Chapter 34. Whence men attributed to God human form</h2>

<p>And if any person investigates the subject of images, and inquires on what ground those who first fashioned your gods conceived that they had the forms of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he will find that this also was derived from the divine history. For seeing that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> history, speaking in the person of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, says, <q>Let Us make man in our image and likeness,</q> these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, under the impression that this meant that men were like God in form, began thus to fashion their gods, supposing they would make a likeness from a likeness. But why, you men of Greece, am I now induced to recount these things? That you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not possible to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion from those who were unable, even on those subjects by which they won the admiration of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>,  to write anything original, but merely propounded by some allegorical device in their own writings what they had learned from <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. Appeal to the Greeks</h2>

<p>The time, then, you men of Greece, is now come, that you, having been persuaded by the secular histories that <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> were far more ancient than any of those who have been esteemed sages among you, abandon the ancient delusion of your forefathers, and read the divine histories of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and ascertain from them the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion; for they do not present to you artful discourses, nor speak speciously and plausibly&mdash; for this is the property of those who wish to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> you of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; but use with simplicity the words and expressions which offer themselves, and declare to you whatever the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who descended upon them, chose to teach through them to those who are desirous to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Having then laid aside all false shame, and the inveterate <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, with all its bombastic parade and empty noise, though by means of it you fancy you are possessed of all advantages, do you give yourselves to the things that profit you. For neither will you commit any offense against your fathers, if you now show a desire to betake yourselves to that which is quite opposed to their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, since it is likely enough that they  themselves are now lamenting in Hades, and repenting with a too late repentance; and if it were possible for them to show you thence what had befallen them after the termination of this life, you would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from what fearful ills they desired to deliver you. But now, since it is not possible in this present life that you either learn from them, or from those who here profess to teach that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> which is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called, it follows as the one thing that remains for you to do, that, renouncing the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of your fathers, you read the prophecies of the sacred writers,  not requiring from them unexceptionable diction (for the matters of our religion lie in works,  not in words), and learn from them what will give you life everlasting. For those who bootlessly disgrace the name of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> are convicted of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing at all, as they are themselves forced, though unwillingly, to confess, since not only do they disagree with each other, but also expressed their own opinions sometimes in one way, sometimes in another.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36. True knowledge not held by the philosophers</h2>

<p>And if <q>the discovery of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q> be given among them as one definition of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, how are they who are not in possession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> worthy of the name of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? For if Socrates, the wisest of your wise men, to whom even your oracle, as you yourselves say, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, saying, <q>Of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> Socrates is the wisest</q>&mdash; if he confesses that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing, how did those who came after him profess to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even things heavenly? For Socrates said that he was on this account called wise, because, while other men pretended to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of, he himself did not shrink from confessing that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing. For he said, <q>I seem to myself to be wisest by this little particular, that what I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I do not suppose I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q> Let no one fancy that Socrates ironically feigned <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, because he often used to do so in his dialogues. For the last expression of his apology which he uttered as he was being led away to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, proves that in seriousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> he was confessing his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>: <q>But now it is time to go away, I indeed to die, but you to live. And which of us goes to the better state, is hidden to all but God.</q> Socrates, indeed, having uttered this last sentence in the Areopagus, departed to the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, ascribing to God alone the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of those things which are hidden from us; but those who came after him, though they are unable to comprehend even earthly things, profess to understand things heavenly as if they had seen them. Aristotle at least&mdash; as if he had seen things heavenly with greater accuracy than <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>&mdash; declared that God did not exist, as <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> said, in the fiery substance (for this was <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> doctrine) but in the fifth element, air. And while he demanded that concerning these matters he should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on account of the excellence of his language, he yet departed this life because he was overwhelmed with the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> and disgrace of being unable to discover even the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Euripus in Chalcis.  Let not any one, therefore, of sound judgment prefer the elegant diction of these men to his own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but let him, according to that old story, stop his ears with wax, and flee the sweet hurt which these sirens would inflict upon him. For the above-mentioned men, presenting their elegant language as a kind of bait, have sought to seduce many from the right religion, in imitation of him who dared to teach the first men <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>. Be not persuaded by these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, I entreat you, but read the prophecies of the sacred writers.  And if any slothfulness or old hereditary <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> prevents you from reading the prophecies of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men through which you can be instructed regarding the one only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is the first article of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him who, though at first he taught you <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, yet afterwards preferred to sing a useful and necessary recantation&mdash; I mean Orpheus, who said what I quoted a little before; and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the others who wrote the same things concerning one God. For it was the work of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> on your behalf, that they, though unwillingly, bore testimony that what the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> said regarding one God was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, in order that, the doctrine of a plurality of gods being rejected by all, occasion might be afforded you of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37. Of the Sibyl</h2> 

<p>And you may in part easily learn the right religion from the ancient Sibyl, who by some kind of potent inspiration teaches you, through her oracular predictions, truths which seem to be much akin to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. She, they say, was of Babylonian extraction, being the daughter of Berosus, who wrote the Chald&aelig;an History; and when she had crossed over (how, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not) into the region of Campania, she there uttered her oracular sayings in a city called Cum&aelig;, six miles from Bai&aelig;, where the hot springs of Campania are found. And being in that city, we saw also a certain place, in which we were shown a very large <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>  cut out of one stone; a vast affair, and worthy of all admiration. And they who had heard it from their fathers as part of their country's tradition, told us that it was  here she used to publish her oracles. And in the middle of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> they showed us three receptacles cut out of one stone, in which, when filled with water, they said that she washed, and having put on her robe again, retires into the inmost chamber of the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>, which is still a part of the one stone; and sitting in the middle of the chamber on a high rostrum and throne, thus proclaims her oracles. And both by many other writers has the Sibyl been mentioned as a prophetess, and also by <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> in his <em>Ph&aelig;drus</em>. And <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> seems to me to have counted <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> divinely inspired when he read her prophecies. For he saw that what she had long ago predicted was accomplished; and on this account he expresses in the Dialogue with Meno his wonder at and admiration of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> in the following terms: <q>Those whom we now call prophetic <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> we should rightly name divine. And not least would we say that they are divine, and are raised to the prophetic <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> by the inspiration and possession of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when they correctly speak of many and important matters, and yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of what they are saying,</q> &mdash; plainly and manifestly referring to the prophecies of the Sibyl. For, unlike the poets who, after their poems are penned, have power to correct and polish, specially in the way of increasing the accuracy of their verse, she was filled indeed with <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> at the time of the inspiration, but as soon as the inspiration ceased, there ceased also the remembrance of all she had said. And this indeed was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> why some only, and not all, the metres of the verses of the Sibyl were preserved. For we ourselves, when in that city, ascertained from our <em>cicerone</em>, who showed us the places in which she used to prophesy, that there was a certain coffer made of brass in which they said that her remains were preserved. And besides all else which they told us as they had heard it from their fathers, they said also that they who then took down her prophecies, being illiterate <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, often went quite astray from the accuracy of the metres; and this, they said, was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the want of metre in some of the verses, the prophetess having no remembrance of what she had said, after the possession and inspiration ceased, and the reporters having, through their lack of education, failed to record the metres with accuracy. And on this account, it is manifest that <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> had an eye to the prophecies of the Sibyl when he said this about <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, for he said, When they correctly speak of many and important matters, and yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of what they are saying.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38. Concluding appeal</h2>

<p>But since, you men of Greece, the matters of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion lie not in the metrical numbers of poetry, nor yet in that culture which is highly esteemed among you, do you henceforward pay less devotion to accuracy of metres and of language; and giving heed without contentiousness to the words of the Sibyl, recognise how great are the benefits which she will confer upon you by predicting, as she does in a clear and patent manner, the advent of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>;  who, being the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, inseparable from Him in power, having assumed man, who had been made in the image and likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, restored to us the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the religion of our ancient forefathers, which the men who lived after them abandoned through the bewitching counsel of the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and turned to the worship of those who were no gods. And if you still hesitate and are hindered from belief regarding the formation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those whom you have hitherto thought it right to give heed to, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your own oracle, when asked by some one to utter a hymn of praise to the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the middle of the hymn spoke thus, <q>Who formed the first of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and called him Adam.</q> And this hymn is preserved by many whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, for the conviction of those who are unwilling to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which all bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to. If therefore, you men of Greece, you do not esteem the false fancy concerning those that are no gods at a higher rate than your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, as I said, the most ancient and time-honoured Sibyl, whose books are preserved in all the world, and who by some kind of potent inspiration both teaches us in her oracular utterances concerning those that are called gods, that have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; and also clearly and manifestly prophesies concerning the predicted advent of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and concerning all those things which were to be done by Him. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these things will constitute your necessary preparatory training for the study of the prophecies of the sacred writers. And if any one supposes that he has learned the doctrine concerning God from the most ancient of those whom you name <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, let him listen to Ammon and Hermes:  to Ammon, who in his discourse concerning God calls Him wholly hidden; and to Hermes, who says plainly and distinctly, <q>that it is difficult to comprehend <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that it is impossible even for the man who can comprehend Him to declare Him to others.</q> From every point of view, therefore, it must be seen that in no other way than only from the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who teach us by divine inspiration, is it at all possible to learn anything concerning God and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. </p>
