<p> <em>The Twelve Books of John Cassian on the Institutes of the C&oelig;nobia, and the Remedies for the Eight Principal Faults.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1. </h2>

<p><strong>Of the Monk's Girdle.</strong></p>

<p>As we are going to speak of the customs and rules of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>, how by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> can we better begin than with the actual dress of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, for we shall then be able to expound in due course their interior life when we have set their outward man before your eyes. A <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, then, as a soldier of Christ ever ready for battle, ought always to walk with his loins girded. For in this fashion, too, the authority of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> shows that they walked who in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> started the original of this life&mdash;I mean Elijah and Elisha; and, moreover, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the leaders and authors of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, viz., John, Peter, and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and the others of the same rank, walked in the same manner. And of these the first-mentioned, who even in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> displayed the flowers of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> life and an example of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and continence, when he had been sent by the Lord to rebuke the messengers of Ahaziah, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because when confined by sickness he had intended to consult <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the god of Ekron, on the state of his health, and thereupon the said <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had met them and said that he should not come down from the bed on which he lay,&mdash; this man was made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the bed-ridden king by the description of the character of his clothing. For when the messengers returned to him and brought back the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> message, he asked what the man who had met them and spoken such words was like and how he was dressed. <q>An hairy man,</q> they said, <q>and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins;</q> and by this dress the king at once saw that it was the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and said: <q>It is Elijah the Tishbite:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350638"><a href="../bible/2ki001.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;1:1-8</a></span> i.e., by the evidence of the girdle and the look of the hairy and unkempt body he recognized without the slightest <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because this was always attached to him as he dwelt among so many thousands of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, as if it were impressed as some special sign of his own particular style. Of John also, who came as a sort of sacred boundary between the Old and <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, being both a beginning and an ending, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by the testimony of the Evangelist that <q>the same John had his raiment of camel's hair and a girdle of skin about his loins.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350639"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;3:4</a></span> When Peter also had been put in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> and was to be brought forth to be slain on the next day, when the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> stood by him he was charged: <q>Gird yourself and put on your shoes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350640"><a href="../bible/act012.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;12:8</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the Lord would certainly not have charged him to do this had he not seen that for the sake of his night's rest he had for a while freed his wearied limbs from the girdle usually tied round them. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, going up to Jerusalem and soon to be put in chains by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, was met at C&aelig;sarea by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>, who took his girdle and bound his hands and feet to show by his bodily actions the injuries which he was to suffer, and said: <q>So shall the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and deliver him into the hands of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350641"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;21:11</a></span> And surely the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> would never have brought this forward, or have said <q>the man whose girdle this is,</q> unless <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had always been accustomed to fasten it round his loins.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the Monk's Robe.</strong></p>

<p>Let the robe also of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> be such as may merely cover the body and prevent the disgrace of nudity, and keep off harm from cold, not such as may foster the seeds of vanity and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; for the same apostle tells us: <q>Having food and covering, with these let us be content.</q>  <q>Covering,</q> he says, not <q>raiment,</q> as is wrongly found in some Latin copies: that is, what may merely cover the body, not what may please the fancy by the splendour of the attire; commonplace, so that it may not be thought remarkable for novelty of colour or fashion among other men of the same profession; and quite free from anxious carefulness, yet not discoloured by stains acquired through neglect. Lastly, let them be so far removed from this world's fashions as to remain altogether common property for the use of the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For whatever is claimed by one or a few among the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and is not the common property of the whole body of the brethren alike is either superfluous or vain, and for that reason to be considered harmful, and affording an appearance of vanity rather than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And, therefore, whatever models we see were not taught either by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of old who laid the foundations of the monastic life, or by the fathers of our own time who in their turn keep up at the present day their customs, these we also should reject as superfluous and useless: wherefore they utterly disapproved of a robe of sackcloth as being visible to all and conspicuous, and what from this very fact will not only confer no benefit on the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> but rather minister to vanity and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and as being inconvenient and unsuitable for the performance of necessary work for which a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> ought always to go ready and unimpeded. But even if we hear of some respectable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have been dressed in this garb, a rule for the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> is not, therefore, to be passed by us, nor should the ancient decrees of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers be upset because we do not think that a few men, presuming on the possession of other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, are to be blamed even in regard of those things which they have practised not in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> rule. For the opinion of a few ought not to be preferred to or to interfere with the general rule for all. For we ought to give unhesitating allegiance and unquestioning <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, not to those customs and rules which the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of a few have introduced, but to those which a long standing antiquity and numbers of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers have passed on by an unanimous decision to those that come after. Nor, indeed, ought this to influence us as a precedent for our daily life, that Joram, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> king of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, when surrounded by bands of his foes, rent his clothes, and is said to have had sackcloth inside them; <span class="stiki" id="note350643"><a href="../bible/2ki006.htm#verse30">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;6:30</a></span> or that the Ninevites, in order to mitigate the sentence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which had been pronounced against them by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, were clothed in rough sackcloth. <span class="stiki" id="note350644"><a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse8">Jonah&nbsp;3:8</a></span> The former is shown to have been clothed with it secretly underneath, so that unless the upper garment had been rent it could not possibly have been <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by any one, and the latter tolerated a covering of sackcloth at a time when, since all were mourning over the approaching destruction of the city and were clothed with the same garments, none could be accused of ostentation. For where there is no special difference and all are alike no harm is done. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the Hoods of the Egyptians.</strong></p>

<p>There are some things besides in the dress of the Egyptians which concern not the care of the body so much as the regulation of the character, that the observance of simplicity and innocence may be preserved by the very character of the clothing. For they constantly use both by day and by night very small hoods coming down to the end of the neck and shoulders, which only cover the head, in order that they may constantly be moved to preserve the simplicity and innocence of little children by imitating their actual dress.  And these men have returned to childhood in Christ and sing at all hours with heart and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: <q>Lord, my heart is not exalted nor are my eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great matters nor in wonderful things above me. If I was not humbly minded, but exalted my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: as a child that is weaned is towards his mother.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the Tunics of the Egyptians.</strong></p>

<p>They wear also linen tunics  which scarcely reach to the elbows, and for the rest leave their hands bare, that the cutting off of the sleeves may suggest that they have cut off all the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> and works of this world, and the garment of linen teach that they are dead to all earthly conversation, and that hereby they may hear the Apostle saying day by day to them: <q>Mortify your members which are upon the earth;</q> their very dress also declaring this: <q>For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> and again: <q>And I live, yet now not I but Christ lives in me. To me indeed the world is crucified, and I to the world.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>Of their Cords. </strong></p>

<p>They also wear double scarves  woven of woollen yarn which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x1F00;&#x03BD;&#x1F71;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03B2;&#x03BF;&#x03B9;</span>, but which we should name girdles  or strings,  or more properly cords.  These falling down over the top of the neck and divided on either side of the throat go round the folds (of the robe) at the armpits and gather them up on either side, so that they can draw up and tuck in close to the body the wide folds of the dress, and so with their arms girt they are made active and ready for all kinds of work, endeavouring with all their might to fulfil the Apostle's charge: <q>For these hands have ministered not only to me but to those also who are with me,</q> <q>Neither have we eaten any man's bread for nought, but with labour and toil working night and day that we should not be burdensome to any of you.</q> And: <q>If any will not work neither let him eat.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>Of their Capes. </strong></p>

<p>Next they cover their necks and shoulders with a narrow cape, aiming at modesty of dress as well as cheapness and economy; and this is called in our language as well as theirs <em>mafors</em>; and so they avoid both the expense and the display of cloaks and great coats.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the Sheepskin and the Goatskin. </strong></p>

<p>The last article of their dress is the goat-skin, which is called <em>melotes</em>, or <em>pera</em>,  and a staff, which they carry in imitation of those who foreshadowed the lines of the monastic life in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, of whom the Apostle says: <q>They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being in want, distressed, afflicted; of whom the world was not worthy; wandering in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens, and in caves of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350659"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse37">Hebrews&nbsp;11:37-38</a></span> And this garment of goatskin signifies that having destroyed all wantonness of carnal <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> they ought to continue in the utmost sobriety of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and that nothing of the wantonness or heat of youth, or of their old lightmindedness, should remain in their bodies.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the Staff of the Egyptians.</strong></p>

<p>For Elisha, himself one of them, teaches that the same men used to carry a staff; as he says to Gehazi, his servant, when sending him to raise the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> son to life: <q>Take my staff and run and go and place it on the lad's face that he may live.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350660"><a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:29</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> would certainly not have given it to him to take unless he had been in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of constantly carrying it about in his hand. And the carrying of the staff spiritually teaches that they ought never to walk unarmed among so many barking dogs of faults and invisible beasts of spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> (from which the blessed David, in his longing to be free, says: <q>Deliver not, O Lord, to the beasts the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that trusts in You</q>),  but when they attack them they ought to beat them off with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> and drive them far away; and when they rage furiously against them they should annihilate them by the constant recollection of the Lord's passion and by following the example of His mortified life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p><strong>Of their Shoes.</strong></p>

<p>But refusing shoes, as forbidden by the command of the gospel, if bodily weakness or the morning cold in winter or the scorching heat of midday compels them, they merely protect their feet with sandals, explaining that by the use of them and the Lord's permission it is implied that if, while we are still in this world we cannot be completely set free from care and anxiety about the flesh, nor can we be altogether released from it, we should at least provide for the wants of the body with as little fuss and as slight an entanglement as possible: and as for the feet of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which ought to be ready for our spiritual race and always prepared for preaching the peace of the gospel (with which feet we run after the odour of the ointments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and of which David says: <q>I ran in thirst,</q> and Jeremiah: <q>But I am not troubled, following You</q>),  we ought not to suffer them to be entangled in the deadly cares of this world, filling our thoughts with those things which concern not the supply of the wants of nature, but unnecessary and harmful pleasures. And this we shall thus fulfil if, as the Apostle advises, we <q>make not provision for the flesh with its <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350663"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;13:14</a></span> But though lawfully enough they make use of these sandals, as permitted by the Lord's command, yet they never suffer them to remain on their feet when they approach to celebrate or to receive the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, as they think that they ought to observe in the letter that which was said to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and to Joshua, the son of Nun: <q>Loose the latchet of your shoe: for the place whereon you stand is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ground.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p><strong>Of the modification in the observances which may be permitted in accordance with the character of the climate or the custom of the district.</strong></p>

<p>So much may be said, that we may not appear to have left out any article of the dress of the Egyptians. But we need only keep to those which the situation of the place and the customs of the district permit. For the severity of the winter does not allow us to be satisfied with slippers  or tunics or a single frock; and the covering of tiny hoods or the wearing of a sheepskin would afford a subject for derision instead of edifying the spectators. Wherefore we hold that we ought to introduce only those things which we have described above, and which are adapted to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> character of our profession and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the climate, that the chief thing about our dress may be not the novelty of the garb, which might give some offense to men of the world, but its <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> simplicity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the Spiritual Girdle and its Mystical Meaning. </strong></p>

<p>Clad, therefore, in these vestments, the soldier of Christ should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> first of all that he is protected by the girdle tied round him, not only that he may be ready in mind for all the work and business of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, but also that he may always go without being hindered by his dress. For he will be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be the more ardent in purity of heart for spiritual progress and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Divine things in proportion as he is the more earnest in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and work. Secondly, he should realize that in the actual wearing of the girdle there is no small <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> declaring what is demanded of him. For the girding of the loins and binding them round with a dead skin signifies that he bears about the mortification of those members in which are contained the seeds of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and lasciviousness, always <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the command of the gospel, which says, <q>Let your loins be girt about,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350668"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;12:35</a></span> is applied to him by the Apostle's interpretation; to wit, <q>Mortify your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscence.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350669"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> And so we find in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> that only those were girt with the girdle in whom the seeds of carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> are found to be destroyed, and who sing with might and main this utterance of the blessed David: <q>For I have become like a bottle in the frost,</q>  because when the sinful flesh is destroyed in the inmost parts they can distend by the power of the spirit the dead skin of the outward man. And therefore he significantly adds <q>in the frost,</q> because they are never satisfied merely with the mortification of the heart, but also have the motions of the outward man and the incentives of nature itself frozen by the approach of the frost of continence from without, if only, as the Apostle says, they no longer allow any reign of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in their mortal body, nor wear a flesh that resists the spirit. </p>
