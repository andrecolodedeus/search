<h1>Institutes (Book III)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the services of the third, sixth, and ninth hours, which are observed in the regions of Syria.</strong></p>

<p>The nocturnal system of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and Psalms as observed throughout <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> has been, I think, by God's help, explained so far as our slender ability was able; and now we must speak of the services of Tierce, Sext, and None, according to the rule of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Palestine and Mesopotamia,  as we said in the Preface, and must moderate by the customs of these the perfection and inimitable rigour of the discipline of the Egyptians.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>How among the Egyptians they apply themselves all day long to prayer and Psalm continually, with the addition of work, without distinction of hours.</strong></p>

<p>For among them (viz., the Egyptians) these offices which we are taught to render to the Lord at separate hours and at intervals of time, with a reminder from the convener, are celebrated continuously throughout the whole day, with the addition of work, and that of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. For manual labour is incessantly practised by them in their cells in such a way that meditation on the Psalms and the rest of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> is never entirely omitted. And as with it at every moment they mingle suffrages and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, they spend the whole day in those offices which we celebrate at fixed times. Wherefore, except Vespers and Nocturns, there are no public services among them in the day except on Saturday and Sunday, when they meet together at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> for the purpose of Holy Communion.  For that which is continuously offered is more than what is rendered at intervals of time; and more acceptable as a free gift than the duties which are performed by the compulsion of a rule: as David for this rejoices somewhat exultingly when he says, <q>Freely will I <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> unto You;</q> and, <q>Let the <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> offerings of my mouth be pleasing to You, O Lord.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>How throughout all the East the services of Tierce, Sext, and None are ended with only three Psalms and prayers each; and the reason why these spiritual offices are assigned more particularly to those hours.</strong></p>

<p>And so in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Palestine and Mesopotamia and all the East the services of the above-mentioned hours are ended each day with three Psalms apiece, so that constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> may be offered to God at the appointed times, and yet, the spiritual duties being completed with due moderation, the necessary offices of work may not be in any way interfered with: for at these three seasons we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Daniel the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also poured forth his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to God day by day in his chamber with the windows open. <span class="stiki" id="note350719"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm#verse10">Daniel&nbsp;6:10</a></span> Nor is it without good reasons that these times are more particularly assigned to religious offices, since at them what completed the promises and summed up our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was fulfilled. For we can show that at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who had been of old promised by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, descended in the first instance on the Apostles assembled together for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. For when in their astonishment at the speaking with tongues, which proceeded from them through the outpouring of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> upon them, the unbelieving people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> mocked and said that they were full of new wine, then Peter, standing up in the midst of them, said: <q>Men of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and all you who dwell at Jerusalem, let this be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you, and consider my words. For these men are not, as you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, drunk, since it is the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> of the day; but this is that which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Joel: and it shall come to pass in the last days, says the Lord, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams. And indeed upon my servants and my handmaids in those days I will pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350720"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse14">Acts&nbsp;2:14-18</a></span> And all of this was fulfilled at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, announced before by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, came at that hour and abode upon the Apostles. But at the sixth hour the spotless Sacrifice, our Lord and Saviour, was offered up to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and, ascending the cross for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole world, made atonement for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and, despoiling principalities and powers, led them away openly; and all of us who were liable to death and bound by the debt of the handwriting that could not be paid, He freed, by taking it away out of the midst and affixing it to His cross for a trophy.  At the same hour, too, to Peter, in an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, there was divinely revealed both the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> by the letting down of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> vessel from heaven, and also the cleansing of all the living creatures contained in it, when a voice came to him and said to him: <q>Rise, Peter; kill and eat;</q>  which vessel, let down from heaven by the four corners, is plainly seen to signify nothing else than the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For although, as it is divided by the fourfold narrative of the Evangelists, it seems to have <q>four corners</q> (or beginnings), yet the body of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is but one; embracing, as it does, the birth as well as the Godhead, and the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as well as the passion of one and the same Christ. Excellently, too, it says not <q>of linen</q> but <q> <em>as</em> if of linen.</q> For linen signifies death. Since, then, our Lord's death and passion were not undergone by the law of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, it says <q>as if of linen.</q> For when dead according to the flesh He was not dead according to the spirit, because <q>His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not left in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, neither did His flesh see corruption.</q>  And again He says: <q>No man takes My life from Me but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350724"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;10:18</a></span> And so in this vessel of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> let down from heaven, that is written by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, all the nations which were formerly outside the observance of the law and reckoned as unclean now flow together through belief in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that they may to their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> be turned away from the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and be serviceable for health-giving food, and are brought to Peter and cleansed by the voice of the Lord. But at the ninth hour, penetrating to hades, He there by the brightness of His splendour extinguished the indescribable darkness of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and, bursting its brazen gates and breaking the iron bars brought away with Him to the skies the captive band of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which was there shut up and detained in the darkness of inexorable <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>,  and, by taking away the fiery sword, restored to paradise its original inhabitants by his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> confession. At the same hour, too, Cornelius, the centurion, continuing with his customary devotion in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, is made aware through the converse of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> with him that his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are remembered before the Lord, and at the ninth hour the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of the calling of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> is clearly shown to him, which had been revealed to Peter in his <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of mind at the sixth hour. In another passage, too, in the Acts of the Apostles, we are told as follows about the same time: <q>But Peter and John went up into the temple at the hour of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the ninth hour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350727"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;3:1</a></span> And by these notices it is clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that these hours were not without good reason <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with religious services by <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and apostolic men, and ought to be observed in like manner by us, who, unless we are compelled, as it were, by some rule to discharge these <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> offices at least at stated times, either through sloth or through forgetfulness, or being absorbed in business, spend the whole day without engaging in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. But concerning the evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> what is to be said, since even in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> these are ordered to be offered continually by the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>? For that the morning whole-burnt offerings and evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were offered every day continually in the temple, although with figurative offerings, we can show from that which is sung by David: <q>Let my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be set forth in Your sight as the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and let the lifting up of my hands be an evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q>  in which place we can understand it in a still higher sense of that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which was given by the Lord our Saviour in the evening to the Apostles at the Supper, when He instituted the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of that evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which He Himself, on the following day, in the end of the ages, offered up to the Father by the lifting up of His hands for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the whole world; which spreading forth of His hands on the Cross is quite correctly called a <q>lifting up.</q> For when we were all lying in hades He raised us to heaven, according to the word of His own promise when He says: <q>When I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350729"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;12:32</a></span> But concerning Mattins, that also teaches us which it is customary every day to sing at it: <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to You do I watch at break of day;</q> and <q>I will meditate on You in the morning;</q> and <q>I prevented the dawning of the day and cried;</q> and again, <q>My eyes to You have prevented the morning, that I might meditate on Your words.</q>  At these hours too that householder in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> hired labourers into his vineyard. For thus also is he described as having hired them in the early morning, which time denotes the Mattin office; then at the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>; then at the sixth; after this, at the ninth; and last of all, at the eleventh, <span class="stiki" id="note350731"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;20:1-6</a></span> by which the hour of the lamps  is denoted. </p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>How the Mattin office was not appointed by an ancient tradition but was started in our own day for a definite reason.</strong></p>

<p>But you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that this Mattins, which is now very generally observed in Western countries, was appointed as a canonical office in our own day, and also in our own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, where <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was born of a Virgin and deigned to submit to growth in infancy as man, and where by His Grace He supported our own infancy, still tender in religion, and, as it were, fed with milk.  For up till that time we find that when this office of Mattins (which is generally celebrated after a short interval after the Psalms and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of Nocturns in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>) was finished, together with the daily <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, the remaining hours were assigned by our Elders to bodily refreshment. But when some rather carelessly abused this indulgence and prolonged their time for sleep too long, as they were not <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> by the requirements of any service to leave their cells or rise from their beds till the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a>; and when, as well as losing their labour, they were drowsy from excess of sleep in the daytime, when they ought to have been applying themselves to some duties, (especially on those days when an unusually oppressive weariness was caused by their keeping watch from the evening till the approach of morning), a complaint was brought to the Elders by some of the brethren who were ardent in spirit and in no slight measure disturbed by this carelessness, and it was determined by them after long discussion and anxious consideration that up till sunrise, when they could without harm be ready to read or to undertake manual labour, time for rest should be given to their wearied bodies, and after this they should all be summoned to the observance of this service and should rise from their beds, and by reciting three Psalms and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> (after the order anciently fixed for the observance of Tierce and Sext, to signify the confession of the Trinity)  should at the same time by an uniform arrangement put an end to their sleep and make a beginning to their work. And this form, although it may seem to have arisen out of an accident and to have been appointed within recent memory for the reason given above, yet it clearly makes up according to the letter that number which the blessed David indicates (although it can be taken spiritually): <q>Seven times a day do I praise You because of Your righteous judgments.</q>  For by the addition of this service we certainly hold these spiritual assemblies seven times a day, and are shown to sing praises to God seven times in it.  Lastly, though this same form, starting from the East, has most beneficially spread to these parts, yet still in some long-established <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the East, which will not brook the slightest violation of the old rules of the Fathers, it seems never to have been introduced. </p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>How they ought not to go back to bed again after the Mattin prayers.</strong></p>

<p>But some in this province, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the reason why this office was appointed and introduced, go back again to bed after their Mattin <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are finished, and in spite of it fall into that very habit to check which our Elders instituted this service. For they are eager to finish it at that hour, that an opportunity maybe given, to those who are inclined to be indifferent and not careful enough, to go back to bed again, which most certainly ought not to be done (as we showed more fully in the previous book when describing the service of the Egyptians),  for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the force of our natural <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> should be aroused and stain that purity of ours which was gained by <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> confession and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before the dawn, or some illusion of the enemy pollute us, or even the repose of a pure and natural sleep interfere with the fervour of our spirit and make us lazy and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> throughout the whole day, as we are chilled by the sluggishness caused by sleep. And to avoid this the Egyptians, and especially as they are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of rising at fixed times even before the cock-crow, when the canonical office  has been celebrated, afterwards prolong their <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> even to daylight, that the morning light when it comes on them may find them established in fervour of spirit, and keep them still more careful and fervent all through the day, as it has found them prepared for the conflict and strengthened against their daily struggle with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> by the practice of nocturnal <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> and spiritual meditation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>How no change was made by the Elders in the ancient system of Psalms when the Mattin office was instituted.</strong></p>

<p>But this too we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, viz., that no change was made in the ancient arrangement of Psalms by our Elders who decided that this Mattin service should be added;  but that office  was always celebrated in their nocturnal assemblies according to the same order as it had been before. For the <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> which in this country they used at the Mattin service at the close of the nocturnal <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, which they are accustomed to finish after the cock-crowing and before dawn, these they still sing in like manner; viz., <a href="../bible/psa148.htm">Ps. 148</a>, beginning <q>O praise the Lord from heaven,</q> and the rest which follow; but the 50th Psalm and the 62nd, and the 89th have, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, been assigned to this new service. Lastly, throughout <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> at this day, when the Mattin <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> are ended, the 50th Psalm is sung in all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, which I have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> can only have been derived from this source.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p><strong>How one who does not come to the daily prayer before the end of the first Psalm is not allowed to enter the Oratory; but at Nocturnes a late arrival up to the end of the second Psalm can be overlooked.</strong></p>

<p>But one who at Tierce, Sext, or None has not come to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before the Psalm is begun and finished does not venture further to enter the Oratory nor to join himself to those singing the Psalms; but, standing outside, he awaits the breaking-up of the congregation,  and while they are all coming out does penance lying on the ground, and obtains absolution for his carelessness and lateness, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he can in no other way expiate the fault of his sloth, nor can ever be admitted to the service which will follow three hours later, unless he has been quick to make satisfaction at once for his present negligence by the help of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humility. But in the nocturnal assemblies a late arrival up to the <em>second</em> Psalm is allowed, provided that before the Psalm is finished and the brethren bow down in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> he makes haste to take his place in the congregation and join them; but he will most certainly be subjected to the same blame and penance which we mentioned before if he has delayed ever so little beyond the hour permitted for a late arrival. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the Vigil service which is celebrated on the evening preceding the Sabbath; of its length, and the manner in which it is observed.</strong></p>

<p>In the winter time, however, when the nights are longer, the Vigils,  which are celebrated every week on the evening at the commencing the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, are arranged by the elders in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> to last till the fourth cock-crowing, for this reason, viz., that after the watch through the whole night they may, by resting their bodies for the remaining time of nearly two hours, avoid flagging through drowsiness the whole day long, and be content with repose for this short time instead of resting the whole night. And it is proper for us, too, to observe this with the utmost care, that we may be content with the sleep which is allowed us after the office of Vigils up to daybreak,&mdash; i.e., till the Mattin Psalms, &mdash; and afterwards spend the whole day in work and necessary duties, lest through weariness from the Vigils, and feebleness, we might be forced to take by day the sleep which we cut off from the night, and so be thought not to have cut short our bodily rest so much as to have changed our time for repose and nightly retirement. For our feeble flesh could not possibly be defrauded of the whole night's rest and yet keep its vigour unshaken throughout the following day without sleepiness of mind and heaviness of spirit, as it will be hindered rather than helped by this unless after Vigils are over it enjoys a short slumber. And, therefore, if, as we have suggested, at least an hour's sleep is snatched before daybreak, we shall save all the hours of Vigils which we have spent all through the night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, granting to nature what is due to it, and having no necessity of taking back by day what we have cut off from the night. For a man will certainly have to give up everything to this flesh if he tries, not in a rational manner to withhold a part only, but to refuse the whole, and (to speak candidly) is anxious to cut off not what is superfluous but what is necessary. Wherefore Vigils have to be made up for with greater interest if they are prolonged with ill-considered and unreasonable length till daybreak. And so they divide them into an office in three parts, that by this variety the effort may be distributed and the exhaustion of the body relieved by some agreeable relaxation. For when standing they have sung three Psalms antiphonally,  after this, sitting on the ground or in very low stalls, one of them repeats three Psalms, while the rest respond, each Psalm being assigned to one of the brethren, who succeed each other in turn; and to these they add three lessons while still sitting quietly. And so, by lessening their bodily exertion, they manage to observe their Vigils with greater attention of mind. </p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p><strong>The reason why a Vigil is appointed as the Sabbath day dawns, and why a dispensation from fasting is enjoyed on the Sabbath all through the East.</strong></p>

<p>And throughout the whole of the East it has been settled, ever since the time of the preaching of the Apostles, when the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and religion was founded, that these Vigils should be celebrated as the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> dawns,  for this reason&mdash;because, when our Lord and Saviour had been crucified on the sixth day of the week, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, overwhelmed by the freshness of His sufferings, remained watching throughout the whole night, giving no rest or sleep to their eyes. Wherefore, since that time, a service of Vigils has been appointed for this night, and is still observed in the same way up to the present day all through the East. And so, after the exertion of the Vigil, a dispensation from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, appointed in like manner for the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> by apostolic men,  is not without reason enjoined in all the churches of the East, in accordance with that saying of Ecclesiastes, which, although it has another and a mystical sense, is not misapplied to this, by which we are charged to give to both days&mdash; that is, to the seventh and eighth equally&mdash; the same share of the service, as it says: <q>Give a portion to these seven and also to these eight.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350751"><a href="../bible/ecc011.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;11:2</a></span> For this dispensation from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> must not be understood as a participation in the Jewish festival by those above all who are shown to be free from all Jewish <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, but as contributing to that rest of the wearied body of which we have spoken; which, as it <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> continually for five days in the week all through the year, would easily be worn out and fail, unless it were revived by an interval of at least two days.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p><strong>How it was brought about that they fast on the Sabbath in the city.</strong></p>

<p>But some people in some countries of the West, and especially in the city,  not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the reason of this indulgence, think that a dispensation from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> ought certainly not to be allowed on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a>, because they say that on this day the Apostle Peter fasted before his encounter with Simon.  But from this it is quite clear that he did this not in accordance with a canonical rule, but rather through the needs of his impending struggle. Since there, too, for the same purpose, Peter seems to have imposed on his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not a general but a special fast, which he certainly would not have done if he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that it was wont to be observed by canonical rule: just as he would surely have been ready to appoint it even on Sunday, if the occasion of his struggle had fallen upon it: but no canonical rule of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> would have been made general from this, because it was no general observance that led to it, but a matter of necessity, which forced it to be observed on a single occasion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the points in which the service held on Sunday differs from what is customary on other days.</strong></p>

<p>But we ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, too, that on Sunday only one office  is celebrated before dinner, at which, out of regard for the actual service  and the Lord's communion, they use a more solemn and a longer service of Psalms and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and lessons, and so consider that Tierce and Sext are included in it. And hence it results that, owing to the addition of the lessons, there is no diminution of the amount of their devotions, and yet some difference is made, and an indulgence over other times seems to be granted to the brethren out of reverence for the Lord's resurrection; and this seems to lighten the observance all through the week, and, by reason of the difference which is interposed, it makes the day to be looked forward to more solemnly as a festival, and owing to the anticipation of it the <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> of the coming week are less felt. For any weariness is always borne with greater equanimity, and labour undertaken without aversion, if some variety is interposed or change of work succeeds.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the days on which, when supper is provided for the brethren, a Psalm is not said as they assemble for the meals as is usual at dinner.</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, also, on those days&mdash;i.e., on Saturday and Sunday,&mdash; and on <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> days, on which it is usual for both dinner and supper to be provided for the brethren, a Psalm is not said in the evening, either when they come to supper or when they rise from it, as is usual at their ordinary dinner  and the canonical refreshment on fast days, which the customary Psalms usually precede and follow. But they simply make a plain <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and come to supper, and again, when they rise from it, conclude with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> alone; because this repast is something special among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>: nor are they all <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to come to it, but it is only for strangers who have come to see the brethren, and those whom bodily weakness or their own inclination invites to it.</p>
