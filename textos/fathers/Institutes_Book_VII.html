<h1>Institutes (Book VII)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1.</h2>

<p><strong>How our warfare with covetousness is a foreign one, and how this fault is not a natural one in man, as the other faults are.</strong></p>

<p>Our third conflict is against <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> which we can describe as the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>; a foreign warfare, and one outside of our nature, and in the case of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> originating only from the state of a corrupt and sluggish <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and often from the beginning of his renunciation being unsatisfactory, and his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards God being lukewarm at its foundation. For the rest of the incitements to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> planted in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> seem to have their commencement as it were congenital with us, and somehow being deeply rooted in our flesh, and almost c&oelig;val with our birth, anticipate our powers of discerning good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and although in very early days they attack a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, yet they are overcome with a long struggle.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2.</h2>

<p><strong>How dangerous is the disease of covetousness.</strong></p>

<p>But this disease coming upon us at a later period, and approaching the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from without,  as it can be the more easily guarded against and resisted, so, if it is disregarded and once allowed to gain an entrance into the heart, is the more dangerous to every one, and with the greater difficulty expelled. For it becomes <q>a root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350877"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:10</a></span> and gives rise to a multiplicity of incitements to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3.</h2>

<p><strong>What is the usefulness of those vices which are natural to us.</strong></p>

<p>For example, do not we see those natural impulses of the flesh not only in boys in whom innocence still anticipates the discernment of good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but even in little children and infants, who although they have not even the slightest approach to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> within them, yet show that the impulses of the flesh exist in them and are naturally excited? Do not we also see that the deadly pricks of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> already exist in full vigour likewise in little children? And before they have learned the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of patience, we see that they are disturbed by wrongs, and feel affronts offered to them even by way of a joke; and sometimes, although strength is lacking to them, the desire to avenge themselves is not wanting, when <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> excites them. Nor do I say this to lay the blame on their natural state, but to point out that of these impulses which proceed from us, some are implanted in us for a useful purpose, while some are introduced from without, through the fault of carelessness and the desire of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will. For these carnal impulses, of which we spoke above, were with a useful purpose implanted in our bodies by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the Creator, viz.: for perpetuating the race, and raising up children for posterity: and not for committing adulteries and debaucheries, which the authority of the law also condemns. The pricks of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> too, do we not see that they have been most wisely given to us, that being enraged at our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and mistakes, we may apply ourselves the rather to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and spiritual exercises, showing forth all <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and patience towards our brethren? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> too how great is the use of sorrow, which is reckoned among the other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, when it is turned to an opposite use. For on the one hand, when it is in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God it is most needful, and on the other, when it is in accordance with the world, most pernicious; as the Apostle teaches us when he says that <q>the sorrow which is according to God works repentance that is steadfast unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but the sorrow of the world works death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350878"><a href="../bible/2co007.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:10</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4.</h2>

<p><strong>That we can say that there exist in us some natural faults, without wronging the Creator.</strong></p>

<p>If then we say that these impulses were implanted in us by the Creator, He will not on that account seem blameworthy, if we choose wrongly to abuse them, and to pervert them to harmful purposes, and are ready to be made sorry by means of the useless Cains of this world, and not by means of showing penitence and the correction of our faults: or at least if we are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> not with ourselves (which would be profitable) but with our brethren in defiance of God's command. For in the case of iron, which is given us for good and useful purposes, if any one should pervert it for murdering the innocent, one would not therefore blame the maker of the metal because man had used to injure others that which he had provided for good and useful purposes of living happily.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the faults which are contracted through our own fault, without natural impulses.</strong></p>

<p>But we affirm that some faults grow up without any natural occasion giving birth to them, but simply from the free choice of a corrupt and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will, as <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and this very <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>; which are caught (so to speak) from without, having no origination in us from natural instincts. But these, in proportion as they are easily guarded against and readily avoided, just so do they make wretched the mind that they have got hold of and seized, and hardly do they suffer it to get at the remedies which would cure it: either because these who are wounded by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom they might either have ignored, or avoided, or easily overcome, do not deserve to be healed by a speedy cure, or else because, having laid the foundations badly, they are unworthy to raise an edifice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and reach the summit of perfection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6.</h2>

<p><strong>How difficult the evil of covetousness is to drive away when once it has been admitted.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Wherefore</span> let not this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> seem of no account or unimportant to anybody: for as it can easily be avoided, so if it has once got hold of any one, it scarcely suffers him to get at the remedies for curing it. For it is a regular nest of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and a <q>root of all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> and becomes a hopeless incitement to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, as the Apostle says, <q>Covetousness,</q> i.e. the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, <q>is a root of all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350879"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:10</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 7.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the source from which covetousness springs, and of the evils of which it is itself the mother.</strong></p>

<p>When then this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> has got hold of the slack and lukewarm <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, it begins by tempting him in regard of a small sum of money, giving him excellent and almost reasonable excuses why he ought to retain some money for himself. For he complains that what is provided in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is not sufficient, and can scarcely be endured by a sound and sturdy body. What is he to do if ill health comes on, and he has no special store of his own to support him in his weakness? He says that the allowance of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> is but meagre, and that there is the greatest carelessness about the sick: and if he has not something of his own so that he can look after the wants of his body, he will perish miserably. The dress which is allowed him is insufficient, unless he has provided something with which to procure another. Lastly, he says that he cannot possibly remain for long in the same place and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and that unless he has secured the money for his journey, and the cost of his removal over the sea, he cannot move when he wants to, and, detained by the compulsion of want, will henceforth drag out a wretched and wearisome <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> without making the slightest advance: that he cannot without indignity be supported by another's substance, as a pauper and one in want. And so when he has bamboozled himself with such thoughts as these, he racks his brains to think how he can acquire at least one penny. Then he anxiously searches for some special work which he can do without the Abbot <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> anything about it. And selling it secretly, and so securing the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> coin, he torments himself worse and worse in thinking how he can double it: puzzled as to where to deposit it, or to whom to entrust it. Then he is oppressed with a still weightier care as to what to buy with it, or by what transaction he can double it. And when this has turned out as he wished, a still more greedy craving for gold springs up, and is more and more keenly excited, as his store of money grows larger and larger. For with the increase of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> the mania of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> increases. Then next he has forebodings of a long life, and an enfeebled old age, and infirmities of all sorts, and long drawn out, which will be insupportable in old age, unless a large store of money has been laid by in youth. And so the wretched <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is agitated, and held fast, as it were, in a serpent's toils, while it endeavours to add to that heap which it has unlawfully secured, by still more unlawful care, and itself gives birth to plagues which inflame it more sorely, and being entirely absorbed in the quest of gain, pays attention to nothing but how to get money with which to fly  as quickly as possible from the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, never keeping <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> where there is a gleam of hope of money to be got. For this it shrinks not from the crime of lying, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, and theft, of breaking a promise, of giving way to injurious bursts of passion. If the man has dropped away at all from the hope of gain, he has no scruples about transgressing the bounds of humility, and through it all gold and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of gain become to him his god, as the belly does to others. Wherefore the blessed Apostle, looking out on the deadly poison of this pest, not only says that it is a root of all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but also calls it the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, saying <q>And <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> (which in Greek is called <span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x03B9;&#x03BB;&#x03B1;&#x03C1;&#x03B3;&#x03C5;&#x03C1;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span>) which is the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350881"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> You see then to what a downfall this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> step by step leads, so that by the voice of the Apostle it is actually declared to be the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and false gods, because passing over the image and likeness of God (which one who serves God with devotion ought to preserve undefiled in himself), it chooses to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and care for images stamped on gold instead of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8.</h2>

<p><strong>How covetousness is a hindrance to all virtues.</strong></p>

<p>With such strides then in a downward direction he goes from bad to worse, and at last cares not to retain I will not say the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> but even the shadow of humility, charity, and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>; and is displeased with everything, and murmurs and groans over every work; and now having cast off all reverence, like a bad-tempered horse, dashes off headlong and unbridled: and discontented with his daily food and usual clothing, announces that he will not put up with it any longer. He declares that God is not only there, and that his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is not confined to that place, where, if he does not take himself off pretty quickly from it, he deeply laments that he will soon die.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9.</h2>

<p><strong>How a monk who has money cannot stay in the monastery.</strong></p>

<p>And so having money to provide for his wanderings, with the assistance of which he has fitted himself as it were with wings, and now being quite ready for his move, he answers impertinently to all commands, and behaves himself like a stranger and a visitor, and whatever he sees needing improvement, he despises and treats with contempt. And though he has a supply of money secretly hidden, yet he complains that he has neither shoes nor clothes, and is indignant that they are given out to him so slowly. And if it happens that through the management of the superior some of these are given first to one who is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have nothing whatever, he is still more inflamed with burning rage, and thinks that he is despised as a stranger; nor is he contented to turn his hand to any work, but finds fault with everything which the needs of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> require to be done. Then of set purpose he looks out for opportunities of being offended and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, lest he might seem to have gone forth from the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for a trivial reason. And not content to take his departure by himself alone, lest it should be thought that he has left as it were from his own fault, he never stops corrupting as many as he can by clandestine conferences. But if the severity of the weather interferes with his journey and travels, he remains all the time in suspense and anxiety of heart, and never stops sowing and exciting discontent; as he thinks that he will only find consolation for his departure and an excuse for his fickleness in the bad character and defects of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the toils which a deserter from a monastery must undergo through covetousness, though he used formerly to murmur at the very slightest tasks.</strong></p>

<p>And so he is driven about, and more and more inflamed with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of his money, which when it is acquired, never allows a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> either to remain in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> or to live under the discipline of a rule. And when separating him like some wild beast from the rest of the herd, it has made him through want of companions an animal fit for prey, and caused him to be easily eaten up, as he is deprived of fellow lodgers, it forces him, who once thought it beneath him to perform the slight duties of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, to labour without stopping night and day, through hope of gain; it suffers him to keep no services of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, no system of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, no rule of <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>; it does not allow him to fulfil the duties of seemly intercession, if only he can satisfy the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, and supply his daily wants; inflaming the more the fire of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, while believing that it will be extinguished by getting.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p><strong>That under pretence of keeping the purse women have to besought to dwell with them.</strong></p>

<p>Hence many are led on over an abrupt precipice, and by an irrevocable fall, to death, and not content to possess by themselves that money which they either never had before, or which by a bad beginning they kept back, they seek for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to dwell with them, to preserve what they have unjustifiably amassed or retained. And they implicate themselves in so many harmful and dangerous occupations, that they are cast down even to the depths of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, while they refuse to acquiesce in that saying of the Apostle, that <q>having food and clothing they should be content</q> with that which the thrift of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> supplied, but <q>wishing to become rich they fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> and the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and many unprofitable and hurtful desires, which drown men in destruction and perdition. For the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>,</q> i.e. <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, <q>is a root of all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which some <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> have erred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have entangled themselves in many sorrows.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350882"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:8-10</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p><strong>An instance of a lukewarm monk caught in the snares of covetousness.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></span> of one, who thinks himself a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and what is worse flatters himself on his perfection, who had been received into a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and when charged by his Abbot not to turn his thoughts back to those things which he had given up and renounced, but to free himself from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, the root of all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and from earthly snares; and when told that if he wished to be cleansed from his former <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, by which he saw that he was from time to time grievously oppressed, he should cease from caring about those things which even formerly were not his own, entangled in the chains of which he certainly could not make progress towards purifying himself of his faults: with an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> expression he did not hesitate to answer, <q>If you have that with which you can support others, why do you forbid me to have it as well?</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p><strong>What the elders relate to the juniors in the matter of stripping off sins.</strong></p>

<p>But let not this seem superfluous or objectionable to any one. For unless the different kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are first explained, and the origin and causes of diseases traced out, the proper healing remedies cannot be applied to the sick, nor can the preservation of perfect health be secured by the strong. For both these matters and many others besides these are generally put forward for the instruction of the younger brethren by the elders in their conferences, as they have had experience of numberless falls and the ruin of all sorts of people. And often recognizing in ourselves many of these things, when the elders explained and showed them, as men who were themselves disquieted  by the same <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, we were cured without any shame or confusion on our part, since without saying anything we learned both the remedies and the causes of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which beset us, which we have passed over and said nothing about, not from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the brethren, but lest our book should chance to fall into the hands of some who have had no instruction in this way of life, and might disclose to inexperienced <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> what ought to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only to those who are toiling and striving to reach the heights of perfection.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p><strong>Instances to show that the disease of covetousness is threefold.</strong></p>

<p>And so this disease and unhealthy state is threefold, and is condemned with equal abhorrence by all the fathers. One feature is this, of which we described the taint above, which by deceiving wretched folk persuades them to hoard though they never had anything of their own when they lived in the world. Another, which forces men afterwards to resume and once more desire those things which in the early days of their renunciation of the world they gave up. A third, which springing from a faulty and hurtful beginning and making a bad start, does not suffer those whom it has once infected with this lukewarmness of mind to strip themselves of all their worldly goods, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of poverty and want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and those who keep back money and property which they certainly ought to have renounced and forsaken, it never allows to arrive at the perfection of the gospel. And we find in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> instances of these three catastrophes which were visited with no light punishment. For when Gehazi wished to acquire what he had never had before, not only did he fail to obtain the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> which it would have been his to receive from his master by hereditary succession, but on the contrary he was covered by the curse of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Elisha with a perpetual <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>: while Judas, wanting to resume the possession of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which he had formerly cast away when he followed Christ, not only fell into betraying the Lord, and lost his apostolic rank, but also was not allowed to close his life with the common lot of all but ended it by a violent death. But Ananias and Sapphira, keeping back a part of that which was formerly their own, were at the Apostle's word punished with death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the difference between one who renounces the world badly and one who does not renounce it at all.</strong></p>

<p>Of those then who say that they have renounced this world, and afterwards being overcome by want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are afraid of losing their worldly goods, a charge is given <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> in Deuteronomy. <q>If any man is afraid and of a fearful heart let him not go forth to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: let him go back and return home, lest he make the hearts of his brethren to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> as he himself is timid and frightened.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350885"><a href="../bible/deu020.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy&nbsp;20:8</a></span> What can one want plainer than this testimony? Does not Scripture clearly prefer that they should not take on them even the earliest stages of this profession and its name, rather than by their persuasion and bad example turn others back from the perfection of the gospel, and weaken them by their faithless terror. And so they are bidden to withdraw from the battle and return to their homes, because a man cannot fight the Lord's battle with a double heart. For <q>a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350886"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse8">James&nbsp;1:8</a></span> And thinking, according to that Parable in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note350887"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;14:31-32</a></span> that he who goes forth with ten thousand men against a king who comes with twenty thousand, cannot possibly fight, they should, while he is yet a great way off, ask for peace; that is, it is better for them not even to take the first step towards renunciation, rather than afterwards following it up coldly, to involve themselves in still greater dangers. For <q>it is better not to vow, than to vow and not pay.</q>  But finely is the one described as coming with ten thousand and the other with twenty.

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the authority under which those shelter themselves who object to stripping themselves of their goods.</strong></p>

<p>These then try to make out a case for their original <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, by some authority from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which they interpret with base ingenuity, in their desire to wrest and pervert to their own purposes a saying of the Apostle or rather of the Lord Himself: and, not adapting their own life or understanding to the meaning of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, but making the meaning of Scripture bend to the desires of their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, they try to make it to correspond to their own views, and say that it is written, <q>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350891"><a href="../bible/act020.htm#verse35">Acts&nbsp;20:35</a></span> And by an entirely wrong interpretation of this they think that they can weaken the force of that saying of the Lord in which he says: <q>If you will be perfect, go sell all that you have and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350892"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> And they think that under colour of this they need not deprive themselves of their riches: declaring indeed that they are more blessed if, supported by that which originally belonged to them, they give to others also out of their superabundance. And while they are shy of embracing with the Apostle that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> state of abnegation for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, they will not be content either with manual labour or the sparing diet of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. And the only thing is that these must either <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they are deceiving themselves, and have not really renounced the world while they are clinging to their former riches; or, if they really and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> want to make trial of the monastic life, they must give up and forsake all these things and keep back nothing of that which they have renounced, and, with the Apostle, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <q>in hunger and thirst, in cold and nakedness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350893"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse27">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:27</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the renunciation of the apostles and the primitive church.</strong></p>

<p>As if he (who, by his assertion that he was endowed with the privileges of a Roman citizen from his birth, testifies that he was no mean person according to this world's rank) might not likewise have been supported by the property which formerly belonged to him! And as if those men who were possessors of lands and houses in Jerusalem and sold everything and kept back nothing whatever for themselves, and brought the price of them and laid it at the feet of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, might not have supplied their bodily necessities from their own property, had this been considered the best plan by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, or had they themselves deemed it preferable! But they gave up all their property at once, and preferred to be supported by their own labour, and by the contributions of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, of whose collection the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostle speaks in writing to the Romans, and declaring his own office in this matter to them, and urging them on likewise to make this collection: <q>But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are at Jerusalem: it has pleased them indeed, and their debtors they are. For if the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> are made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also to minister to them in carnal things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350894"><a href="../bible/rom015.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;15:25-27</a></span> To the Corinthians also he shows the same anxiety about this, and urges them the more diligently to prepare before his arrival a collection, which he was intending to send for their needs. <q>But concerning the collection for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as I appointed to the churches of Galatia, so also do. Let each one of you on the first day of the week put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him, that when I come the collections be not then to be made. But when I come whomsoever you shall approve by your letters, them I will send to carry your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to Jerusalem.</q> And that he may stimulate them to make a larger collection, he adds, <q>But if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350895"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:1-4</a></span> meaning if your offering is of such a character as to deserve to be taken there by my ministration. To the Galatians too, he testifies that when he was settling the division of the ministry of preaching with the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, he had arranged this with James, Peter, and John: that he should undertake the preaching to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but should never repudiate care and anxious thought for the poor who were at Jerusalem, who for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake gave up all their goods, and submitted to <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty. <q>And when they saw,</q> said he, <q>the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and to Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should preach to the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but they to those of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>: only they would that we should be mindful of the poor.</q> A matter which he testifies that he attended to most carefully, saying, <q>which also I was anxious of myself to do.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350896"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;2:9-10</a></span> Who then are the more blessed, those who but lately were gathered out of the number of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and being unable to climb to the heights of the perfection of the gospel, clung to their own property, in whose case it was considered a great thing by the Apostle if at least they were restrained from the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood, <span class="stiki" id="note350897"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse20">Acts&nbsp;15:20</a></span> and had embraced the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, with their goods and all: or those who live up to the demands of the gospel, and carry the Lord's cross daily, and want nothing out of their property to remain for their own use? And if the blessed Apostle himself, bound with chains and fetters, or hampered by the difficulties of travelling, and for these reasons not being able to provide with his hands, as he generally did, for the supply of his food, declares that he received that which supplied his wants from the brethren who came from Macedonia; <q>For that which was lacking to me,</q> he says, <q>the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350898"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:9</a></span> and to the Philippians he says: <q>For you Philippians <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I came from Macedonia, no church communicated with me in the matter of giving and receiving, except you only; because even in Thessalonica once and again you sent to supply my needs:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350899"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;4:15-16</a></span> (if this was so) then, according to the notion of these men, which they have formed in the coldness of their heart, will those men really be more blessed than the Apostle, because it is found that they have ministered to him of their substance? But this no one will venture to assert, however big a fool he may be.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.</h2>

<p><strong>That if we want to imitate the apostles we ought not to live according to our own prescriptions, but to follow their example.</strong></p>

<p><span class="sc">Wherefore</span> if we want to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the gospel precept, and to show ourselves the followers of the Apostle and the whole primitive church, or of the fathers who in our own days succeeded to their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and perfection, we should not acquiesce in our own prescriptions, promising ourselves perfection from this wretched and lukewarm condition of ours: but following their footsteps, we should by no means aim at looking after our own interests, but should seek out the discipline and system of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, that we may in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> renounce this world; preserving nothing of those things which we have despised through the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and should look for our daily food, not from any store of money of our own, but from our own labours.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p><strong>A saying of S. Basil, the Bishop, directed against Syncletius. </strong></p>

<p>There is current a saying of S. Basil, Bishop of C&aelig;sarea, directed against a certain Syncletius, who was growing indifferent with the sort of lukewarmness of which we have spoken; who, though he professed to have renounced this world, had yet kept back for himself some of his property, not liking to be supported by the labour of his own hands, and to acquire <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> humility by stripping himself and by grinding toil, and the subjection of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>: <q>You have,</q> said he, <q>spoilt Syncletius, and not made a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 20.</h2>

<p><strong>How contemptible it is to be overcome by covetousness.</strong></p>

<p>And so if we want to strive lawfully in our spiritual combat, let us expel this dangerous enemy also from our hearts. For to overcome him does not so much show great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, as to be beaten by him is shameful and disgraceful. For when you are overpowered by a strong man, though there is grief in being overthrown, and distress at the loss of victory, yet some consolation may be derived by the vanquished from the strength of their opponent. But if the enemy is a poor creature, and the struggle a feeble one, besides the grief for defeat there is confusion of a more disgraceful character, and a shame which is worse than loss.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.</h2>

<p><strong>How covetousness can be conquered.</strong></p>

<p>And in this case it will be the greatest victory and a lasting triumph, if, as is said, the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is not defiled by the possession of the smallest coin. For it is an impossibility for him who, overcome in the matter of a small possession, has once admitted into his heart a root of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire, not to be inflamed presently with the heat of a still greater desire. For the soldier of Christ will be victorious and in safety, and free from all the attacks of desire, so long as this most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit does not implant in his heart a seed of this desire. Wherefore, though in the matter of all kinds of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we ought ordinarily to watch the serpent's head, <span class="stiki" id="note350901"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse15">Genesis&nbsp;3:15</a></span> yet in this above all we should be more keenly on our guard. For if it has been admitted it will grow by feeding on itself, and will kindle for itself a worse fire. And so we must not only guard against the <em>possession</em> of money, but also must expel from our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> the <em>desire</em> for it. For we should not so much avoid the results of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, as cut off by the roots all disposition towards it. For it will do no good not to possess money, if there exists in us the desire for getting it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.</h2>

<p><strong>That one who actually has no money may still be deemed covetous.</strong></p>

<p>For it is possible even for one who has no money to be by no means free from the malady of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and for the blessing of penury to do him no good, because he has not been able to root out the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of cupidity: delighting in the advantages of poverty, not in the merit of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and satisfied with the burden of necessity, not without coldness of heart. For just as the word of the gospel declares of those who are not defiled in body, that they are adulterers in heart; <span class="stiki" id="note350902"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> so it is possible that those who are in no way pressed down with the weight of money may be condemned with the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> in disposition and intent. For it was the opportunity of possessing which was wanting in their case, and not the will for it: which latter is always crowned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rather than compulsion. And so we must use all diligence lest the fruits of our labours should be destroyed to no purpose. For it is a wretched thing to have endured the effects of poverty and want, but to have lost their fruits, through the fault of a shattered will.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.</h2>

<p><strong>An example drawn from the case of Judas.</strong></p>

<p>Would you like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how dangerously and harmfully that incitement, unless it has been carefully eradicated, will shoot up for the destruction of its owner, and put forth all sorts of branches of different <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? Look at Judas, reckoned among the number of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and see how because he would not bruise the deadly head of this serpent it destroyed him with its poison, and how when he was caught in the snares of concupiscence, it drove him into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and a headlong downfall, so that he was persuaded to sell the Redeemer of the world and the author of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for thirty pieces of silver. And he could never have been impelled to this heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the betrayal if he had not been contaminated by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: nor would he have made himself wickedly guilty of betraying  the Lord, unless he had first accustomed himself to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> the bag entrusted to him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.</h2>

<p><strong>That covetousness cannot be overcome except by stripping one's self of everything.</strong></p>

<p>This is a sufficiently dreadful and clear instance of this tyranny, which, when once the mind is taken prisoner by it, allows it to keep to no rules of honesty, nor to be satisfied with any additions to its gains. For we must seek to put an end to this <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, not by riches, but by stripping ourselves of them. Lastly, when he (viz. Judas) had received the bag set apart for the distribution to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and entrusted to his care for this purpose, that he might at least satisfy himself with plenty of money, and set a limit to his <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>, yet his plentiful supply only broke out into a still greedier incitement of desire, so that he was ready no longer secretly to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> the bag, but actually to sell the Lord Himself. For the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of this <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> is not satisfied with any amount of riches.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.</h2>

<p><strong>Of the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira, and Judas, which they underwent through the impulse of covetousness.</strong></p>

<p>Lastly, the chief of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, taught by these instances, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that one who has any <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> cannot bridle it, and that it cannot be put an end to by a large or small sum of money, but only by the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of renunciation of everything, punished with death Ananias and Sapphira, who were mentioned before, because they had kept back something out of their property, that that death which Judas had voluntarily met with for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of betraying the Lord, they might also undergo for their lying <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note350904"><a href="../bible/act005.htm">Acts&nbsp;v</a></span> How closely do the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and punishment correspond in each case! In the one case treachery, in the other <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, was the result of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. In the one case the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is betrayed, in the other the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of lying is committed. For though the issues of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> may appear different, yet they coincide in having one and the same aim. For the one, in order to escape poverty, desired to take back what he had forsaken; the others, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest they might become poor, tried to keep back something out of their property, which they should have either offered to the Apostle in good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or have given entirely to the brethren. And so in each case there follows the judgment of death; because each <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> sprang from the root of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. And so if against those who did not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons'</a> goods, but tried to be sparing of their own, and had no desire to <em>acquire</em>, but only the wish to <em>retain</em>, there went forth so severe a sentence, what should we think of those who desire to amass <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, without ever having had any of their own, and, making a show of poverty before men, are before God convicted of being rich, through the passion of <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.</h2>

<p><strong>That covetousness brings upon the soul a spiritual leprosy.</strong></p>

<p>And such are seen to be <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> in spirit and heart, after the likeness of Gehazi, who, desiring the uncertain riches of this world, was covered with the taint of foul <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, through which he left us a clear example that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is defiled with the stain of cupidity is covered with the spiritual <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and is counted as unclean before God with a perpetual curse.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.</h2>

<p><strong>Scripture proofs by which one who is aiming at perfection is taught not to take back again what he has given up and renounced.</strong></p>

<p>If then through the desire of perfection you have forsaken all things and followed Christ who says to you, <q>Go sell all that you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come follow me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350905"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> why, having put your hand to the plough, do you look back, so that you will be declared by the voice of the same Lord not to be fit for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note350906"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke&nbsp;9:62</a></span> When secure on the top of the gospel roof, why do you descend to carry away something from the house, from those things, namely, which beforetime you despised? When you are out in the field and working at the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, why do you run back and try to clothe yourself again with what belongs to this world, which you stripped off when you renounced it? <span class="stiki" id="note350907"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;17:31</a></span> But if you were hindered by poverty from having anything to give up, still less ought you to amass what you never had before. For by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord you were for this purpose made ready that you might hasten to him the more readily, being hampered by no snares of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. But let no one who is wanting in this be disappointed; for there is no one who has not something to give up. He has renounced all the possessions of this world, whoever has thoroughly eradicated the desire to possess them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.</h2>

<p><strong>That the victory over covetousness can only be gained by stripping one's self bare of everything.</strong></p>

<p>This then is the perfect victory over <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>: not to allow a gleam from the very smallest scrap of it to remain in our heart, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we shall have no further power of quenching it, if we cherish even the tiniest bit of a spark of it in us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.</h2>

<p><strong>How a monk can retain his poverty.</strong></p>

<p>And we can only preserve this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> unimpaired if we remain in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and as the Apostle says, having food and clothing, are therewith content. <span class="stiki" id="note350908"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:8</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 30.</h2>

<p><strong>The remedies against the disease of covetousness.</strong></p>

<p>Keeping then in mind the judgment of Ananias and Sapphira let us dread keeping back any of those things which we gave up and vowed utterly to forsake. Let us also <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the example of Gehazi, who for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> was chastised with the punishment of perpetual <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>. From this let us beware of acquiring that <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which we never formerly possessed. Moreover also dreading both the fault and the death of Judas, let us with all the power that we have avoid taking back any of that <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> which once we cast away from us. Above all, considering the state of our weak and shifty nature, let us beware lest the day of the Lord come upon us as a thief in the night, <span class="stiki" id="note350909"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:4</a></span> and find our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> defiled even by a single penny; for this would make void all the fruits of our renunciation of the world, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that which was said to the rich man in the gospel to be directed towards us also by the voice of the Lord: <q>You fool, this night your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be which you have prepared?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note350910"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;12:20</a></span> And taking no thought for the morrow, let us never allow ourselves to be enticed away from the rule of the C&oelig;nobium.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31.</h2>

<p><strong>That no one can get the better of covetousness unless he stays in the C&oelig;nobium: and how one can remain there.</strong></p>

<p>But we shall certainly not be suffered to do this, nor even to remain under the rule of a system, unless the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of patience, which can only spring from humility as its source, is first securely fixed and established in us. For the one teaches us not to trouble any one else; the other, to endure with magnanimity wrongs offered to us.</p>
