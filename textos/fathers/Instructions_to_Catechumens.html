<h1>Instructions to Catechumens</h1>

<h2>First Instruction</h2>

<p>To those about to be illuminated;  and for what reason the laver is said to be of regeneration and not of remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and that it is a dangerous thing not only to forswear oneself, but also to take an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, even though we <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>.</p>

<p>1. How delightful and lovable is our band of young brethren! For brethren I call you, even now before you have been brought forth, and before your birth I welcome this relationship with you: For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> clearly, to how great an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> you are about to be led, and to how great a dignity; and those who are about to receive dignity, all are wont to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, even before the dignity is conferred, laying up for themselves beforehand by their attention good will for the future. And this also I myself now do. For you are not about to be led to an empty dignity, but to an actual kingdom: and not simply to a kingdom, but to the kingdom of the Heavens itself. Wherefore I beseech and entreat you that you remember me when you come into that kingdom, and as Joseph said to the chief butler <q>Remember me when it shall be well with you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190493"><a href="../bible/gen040.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;40:14</a></span> this also I say now to you, do ye remember me when it is well with you. I do not ask this in return for interpreting your dreams, as he; for I have not come to <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">interpret dreams</a> for you, but to discourse of matters celestial, and to convey to you glad tidings of such <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things as <q>eye has not seen, and ear has not heard and which have entered not into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, such are the things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared for them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190494"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9-10</a></span> Now Joseph indeed said to that chief butler, <q>yet three days and <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> will restore you to your chief butlership.</q> But I do not say, yet three days and you shall be set to pour out the wine of a tyrant, but yet thirty days, and not <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> but the king of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> shall restore you to the country which is on high, Jerusalem, which is free&mdash; to the city which is in the heavens; and <em>he</em> said indeed, <q>You shall give the cup into the hands of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>.</q> But I say not that you shall give the cup into the hands of the king, but that the king shall give the cup into your hand&mdash; that dread cup, full of much power, and more precious than any created thing. The initiated <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of this cup, and you yourselves shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it a little while hence. Remember me, therefore, when you come into that kingdom, when you receive the royal robe, when you are girt with the purple dipped in the master's blood, when you will be crowned with the diadem, which has lustre leaping forth from it on all sides, more brilliant than the rays of the sun. Such are the gifts of the Bridegroom, greater indeed than your worth, but worthy of his lovingkindness.</p>

<p>Wherefore, I count you blessed already before those sacred nuptials, and I do not only count you blessed, but I praise your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> in that you have not come to your illumination as the most <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, at your last breath, but already, like <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> servants, prepared with much goodwill to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> your master, have brought the neck of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with much meekness and readiness beneath the bands of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and have received His easy yoke, and have taken His light burden. For if the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> bestowed be the same both for you and for those who are initiated at their last hour, yet the matter of the intention is not the same, nor yet the matter of the preparation for the rite. For they indeed receive it on their bed, but you in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is the common mother of us all; they indeed with lamentation and weeping, but you rejoicing, and exceeding glad: they sighing, you giving thanks; they indeed lethargic with much fever, you filled with much spiritual pleasure; wherefore in your case all things are in harmony with the gift, but in theirs all are adverse to it. For there is wailing and much lamentation on the part of the initiated, and children stand around crying, wife tearing her cheeks, and dejected friends and tearful servants; the whole aspect of the house resembles some wintry and gloomy day. And if you shall open the heart of him who is lying there, you will find it more downcast than are these. For as winds meeting one another with many a contrary blast, break up the sea into many parts, so too the thought of the terrors preying upon him assail the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the sick man, and distract his mind with many anxieties. Whenever he sees his children, he thinks of their fatherless condition; whenever he looks from them to his wife, he considers her widowhood; when he sees the servants, he beholds the desolation of the whole house; when he comes back to himself, he calls to mind his own present life, and being about to be torn from it, experiences a great cloud of despondency. Of such a kind is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of him who is about to be initiated. Then in the midst of its tumult and confusion, the Priest enters, more formidable than the fever itself, and more distressing than death to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> of the sick man. For the entrance of the Presbyter is thought to be a greater reason for despair than the voice of the physician despairing of his life, and that which suggests <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life seems to be a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of death. But I have not yet put the finishing stroke to these ills. For in the midst of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> raising a tumult and making preparations, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has often taken its flight, leaving the body desolate; and in many cases, while it was present it was useless, for when it neither recognizes those who are present, nor hears their voice, nor is able to answer those words by which it will make that blessed covenant with the common master of us all, but is as a useless log, or a stone, and he who is about to be illuminated lies there differing nothing from a corpse, what is the profit of initiation in a case of such insensibility?</p>

<p>2. For he who is about to approach these <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and dread <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> must be awake and alert, must be clean from all cares of this life, full of much self-restraint, much readiness; he must banish from his mind every thought foreign to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and on all sides cleanse and prepare his home, as if about to receive the king himself. Such is the preparation of your mind: such are your thoughts; such the purpose of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Await therefore a return worthy of this most excellent decision from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who overpowers with His recompense those who show forth <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to Him. But since it is necessary for his fellow servants to contribute of their own, then we will contribute of our own; yea rather not even are these things our own, but these too are our Master's. <q>For what have you,</q> says He, <q>that thou did not receive? But if you received it, why do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as if you had not received it?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190495"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> I wished to say this first of all, why in the world our fathers, passing by the whole year, settled that the children of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be initiated at this season; and for what reason, after the instruction from us, removing your shoes and raiment, unclad and unshod, with but one garment on, they conduct you to hear the words of the exorcisers. For it is not thoughtlessly and rashly that they have planned this dress and this season for us. But both these things have a certain mystic and secret reason. And I wish to say this to you. But I see that our discourse now constrains us to something more necessary to say what <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is, and for what reason it enters into our life, and what <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things it conveys to us.</p>

<p>But, if you will, let us discourse about the name which this mystic cleansing bears: for its name is not one, but very many and various. For this purification is called the laver of regeneration. <q>He saved us,</q> he says, <q>through the laver of regeneration, and renewing of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190496"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus&nbsp;3:5</a></span> It is called also illumination, and this St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> again has called it, <q>For call to remembrance the former days in which after you were illuminated ye endured a great conflict of sufferings;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190497"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse32">Hebrews&nbsp;10:32</a></span> and again, <q>For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and then fell away, to renew them again unto repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190498"><a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;6:4-6</a></span> It is called also, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: <q>For as many of you as were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ did put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190499"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians&nbsp;3:27</a></span> It is called also burial: <q>For we were buried</q> says he, <q>with him, through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, into death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190500"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;6:4</a></span> It is called <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>: <q>In whom you were also <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, with a <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190501"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse11">Galatians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> It is called a cross: <q>Our old man was crucified with him that the body of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> might be done away.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190502"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;6:6</a></span> It is also possible to speak of other names besides these, but in order that we should not spend our whole time over the names of this free gift, come, return to the first name, and let us finish our discourse by declaring its meaning; but in the meantime, let us extend our teaching a little further. There is that laver by means of the baths, common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which is wont to wipe off bodily uncleanness; and there is the Jewish laver, more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> than the other, but far inferior to that of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and it too wipes off bodily uncleanness but not simply uncleanness of body, since it even reaches to the weak <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. For there are many matters, which by nature indeed are not unclean, but which become unclean from the weakness of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. And as in the case of little children, masks, and other bugbears are not in themselves alarming, but seem to little children to be alarming, by reason of the weakness of their nature, so it is in the case of those things of which I was speaking; just as to touch dead bodies is not naturally unclean, but when this comes into contact with a weak <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, it makes him who touches them unclean. For that the thing in question is not unclean naturally, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> himself who ordained this law showed, when he bore off the entire corpse of Joseph, and yet remained clean. On this account <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also, discoursing to us about this uncleanness which does not come naturally but by reason of the weakness of the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, speaks somewhat in this way, <q>Nothing is common of itself save to him who accounts anything to be common.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190503"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;14:14</a></span> Do you not see that uncleanness does not arise from the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the thing, but from the weakness of the reasoning about it? And again: <q>All things indeed are clean, howbeit it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to that man who eats with offense.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190504"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;14:20</a></span> Do you see that it is not to eat, but to eat with offense, that is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of uncleanness?</p>

<p>3. Such is the defilement from which the laver of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> cleansed. But the laver of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not such, but the real uncleanness which has introduced defilement into the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as well as into the body. For it does not make those who have touched dead bodies clean, but those who have set their hand to dead works: and if any man be effeminate, or a fornicator, or an idolator, or a doer of whatever ill you please, or if he be full of all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> there is among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: should he fall into this pool of waters, he comes up again from the divine fountain purer than the sun's rays. And in order that you may not think that what is said is mere vain boasting, hear <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> speaking of the power of the laver, <q>Be not deceived: neither idolators, nor fornicators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, not drunkards, not revilers, not extortioners shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190505"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9-10</a></span> And what has this to do with what has been spoken? Says one, <q>for prove the question whether the power of the laver thoroughly cleanses all these things.</q> Hear therefore what follows: <q>And such were some of you, but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and in the spirit of our God.</q> <em> We</em> promise to show you that they who approach the laver become clean from all fornication: but the word has shown more, that they have become not only clean, but both <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just, for it does not say only <q>you were washed,</q> but also <q>you were sanctified and were justified.</q> What could be more strange than this, when without toil, and exertion, and good works, righteousness is produced? For such is the lovingkindness of the Divine gift that it makes men just without this exertion. For if a letter of the Emperor, a few words being added, sets free those who are liable to countless accusations, and brings others to the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>; much rather will the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is able to do all things, free us from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and grant us much righteousness, and fill us with much assurance, and as a spark falling into the wide sea would straightway be quenched, or would become invisible, being overwhelmed by the multitude of the waters, so also all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, when it falls into the pool of the divine fountain, is more swiftly and easily overwhelmed, and made invisible, than that spark. And for what reason, says one, if the laver take away all our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is it called, not a laver of remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor a laver of cleansing, but a laver of regeneration? Because it does not simply take away our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor simply cleanse us from our faults, but so as if we were born again. For it creates and fashions us anew not forming us again out of earth, but creating us out of another element, namely, of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of water. For it does not simply wipe the vessel clean, but entirely remoulds it again. For that which is wiped clean, even if it be cleaned with care, has traces of its former condition, and bears the remains of its defilement, but that which falls into the new mould, and is renewed by means of the flames, laying aside all uncleanness, comes forth from the furnace, and sends forth the same brilliancy with things newly formed. As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.</p>

<p>4. And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of old said, <q>You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</q>  For that the word is in reference to the faithful, what goes before sufficiently shows us, <q>For you are my Son,</q> he says, <q>today have I begotten you, ask of me and I will give the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for three inheritance, the utmost parts of the earth for your possession.</q>  Do you see how he has made mention of the church of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and has spoken of the kingdom of Christ extended on all sides? Then he says again, <q>You shall rule them with a rod of iron;</q> not grievous, but strong: <q>you shall break them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</q>  Behold then, the laver is more <a href="../cathen/10663b.htm">mystically</a> brought forward. For he does not say earthen vessels: but vessels of the potter. But, give heed: For earthen vessels when crushed would not admit of refashioning, on account of the hardness which was gained by them from the fire. But the fact is that the vessels of the potter are not earthen, but of clay; wherefore, also, when they have been distorted, they can easily, by the skill of the artificer, be brought again to a second shape. When, therefore, God speaks of an irremediable calamity, he does not say vessels of the potter, but an earthen vessel; when, for instance, he wished to teach the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that he delivered up the city to an irremediable calamity, he bade him take an earthen wine-vessel, and crush it before all the people, and say, <q>Thus shall this city be destroyed, be broken in pieces.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190509"><a href="../bible/jer019.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;19:11</a></span> But when he wishes to hold out good hopes to them, he brings the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> to a pottery, and does not show him an earthen vessel, but shows him a vessel of clay, which was in the hands of the potter, falling to the ground: and brings him to it saying, <q>If this potter has taken up and remodelled his vessel which has fallen, shall I not much rather be able to restore you when you have fallen?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190510"><a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse6">Jeremiah&nbsp;18:6</a></span> It is possible therefore for God not only to restore those who are made of clay, through the laver of regeneration, but to bring back again to their original state, on their careful repentance, those who have received the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and have lapsed. But this is not the time for you to hear words about repentance, rather may the time never come for you to fall into the need of these remedies, but may you always remain in preservation of the beauty and the brightness which you are now about to receive, unsullied. In order, then, that you may ever remain thus, come and let us discourse to you a little about your manner of life. For in the wrestling schools falls of the athletes are devoid of danger. For the wrestling is with friends, and they practice all their exercises on the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of their teachers. But when the time of the contest has come, when the lists are open, when the spectators are seated above, when the president has arrived, it necessarily follows that the combatants, if they become careless, fall and retire in great disgrace, or if they are in earnest, win the crowns and the prizes. So then, in your case these thirty days are like some wrestling school, both for exercise and practice: let us learn from thence already to get the better of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>. For it is to contend with him that we have to strip ourselves, with him after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> are we to box and fight. Let us learn from thence already his grip, on what side he is aggressive, on what side he can easily threaten us, in order that, when the contest comes on, we may not feel strange, nor become confused, as seeing new forms of wrestling; but having already practiced  them among ourselves, and having learned all his methods, may engage in these forms of wrestling against him with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. In all ways, therefore, is he accustomed to threaten us, but especially by means of the tongue, and the mouth. For there is no organ so convenient for him for our deception and our destruction as an unchastened tongue and an unchecked utterance. Hence come many slips on our part: hence many serious accusations against us. And the ease of these falls through the tongue a certain one showed, when he said, <q>Many fell by the sword, but not so many as by the tongue.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190511"><a href="../bible/sir028.htm#verse22">Sirach&nbsp;28:22</a></span> Now the gravity of the fall the same person shows us again when he says: <q>To slip upon a pavement is better than to slip with the tongue.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190512"><a href="../bible/sir020.htm#verse18">Sirach&nbsp;20:18</a></span> And what he speaks of is of this kind. Better it is, says he, that the body should fall and be crushed, than that such a word should go forth as destroys the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and he does not speak of falls merely; he also admonishes us that much forethought should be exercised, so that we should not be tripped up, thus saying <q>Make a door and bars for your mouth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190513"><a href="../bible/sir020.htm#verse25">Sirach&nbsp;20:25</a></span> not that we should prepare doors and bars, but that with much security, we should shut the tongue off from outrageous words; and again in another place, after showing that we need influence from above, both as accompanying and preceding our own effort so as to keep this wild beast within: stretching forth his hands to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> said, <q>Let the lifting up of my hands be an evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of my lips;</q> and he who before admonished, himself too  says again <q>Who shall set a watch before my mouth, and a seal of wisdom upon my lips?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190515"><a href="../bible/sir022.htm#verse27">Sirach&nbsp;22:27</a></span> Do you not see, each one fearing these falls and bewailing them, both giving advice, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that the tongue may have the benefit of much watchfulness? And for what reason, says one, if this organ brings us such ruin, did God originally place it within us? Because indeed, it is of great use, and if we are careful, it is of use only, and brings no ruin. Hear, for example, what he says who spoke the former words, <q>Death and life are in the power of the tongue.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190516"><a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse21">Proverbs&nbsp;18:21</a></span> And Christ points to the same thing when he says, <q>By your words you shall be condemned, and by your words you shall be justified.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190517"><a href="../bible/mar012.htm#verse27">Mark&nbsp;12:27</a></span> For the tongue stands in the midst ready for use on either hand. You are its master. Thus indeed a sword lies in the midst, and if you use it against your enemies, this organ becomes a means of safety for you. But if you thrust its stroke against yourself, not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the iron, but your own transgression becomes the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of your slaughter. Let us then take this view of the tongue. It is a sword lying in the midst; sharpen it for the purpose of accusing your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Thrust not the stroke against your brother. For this reason God surrounded it with a double fortification; with the fence of the teeth and the barrier of the lips, that it may not rashly and without circumspection utter words which are not convenient. Well, do you say it will not endure this? Bridle it therefore within. Restrain it by means of the teeth, as though giving over its body to these executioners and making them bite it. For it is better that when it <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> now it should be bitten by the teeth, than one day when it seeks a drop of water and is parched with heat, to be unable to obtain this consolation. In many other ways indeed it is wont to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by raillery and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, by uttering foul words, by <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>, swearing, and <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>.</p>

<p>5. But in order that we may not by saying everything at once today, confuse your minds, we put before you one custom, namely, about the avoidance of oaths, saying this much by way of preface, and speaking plainly&mdash; that if you do not avoid oaths, I say not <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> merely, but those too which happen in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, we shall not further discourse upon any other subject. For it is monstrous that teachers of letters should not give a second lesson to their children until they see the former one fixed well in their memory, but that we, without being able to express our first lessons clearly, should inculcate others before the first are completed. For this is nothing else than to pour into a perforated jar. Give great care, then, that you silence not our mouth. For this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is grave, and it is exceedingly grave because it does not seem to be grave, and on this account I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> it, because no one fears it. On this account the disease is incurable, because it does not seem to be a disease; but just as simple speech is not a crime, so neither does this seem to be a crime, but with much boldness this transgression is committed: and if any one call it in question, straightway laughter follows, and much ridicule, not of those who are called in question for their oaths, but of those who wish to rectify the disease. On this account I largely extend my discourse about these matters. For I wish to pull up a deep root, and to wipe out a long-standing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: I speak not of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> alone, but even of oaths in good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But so and so, says one, a forbearing man, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, living in much self-control and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, takes an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Do not speak to me of this forbearing person, this self-controlled, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man who is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; but if you will, add that this man is Peter, or <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, or even an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> descended out of heaven. For not even in such a case do I regard the dignity of their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For the law which I read upon oaths, is not that of the servant, but of the King: and when the edicts of a king are read, let every claim of the servants be silent. But if you are able to say that Christ bade us use oaths, or that Christ did not punish the doing of this, show me, and I am persuaded. But if he forbids it with so much care, and takes so much thought about the matter as to class him who takes an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one (for whatsoever is more than these, namely, than yea and nay, says he, is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>), <span class="stiki" id="note190518"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;5:35</a></span> why do you bring this person and that person forward? For not because of the carelessness of your fellow servants, but from the injunctions of his own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, will God record his vote against you. I have commanded, he says, you ought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, not to shelter yourself behind such and such a person and concern yourself with other <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons'</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Since the great David <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, is it then safe for us to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Tell me: on this account then we ought to make sure of this point, and only to emulate the good works of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and if there is carelessness, and transgression of the law anywhere, we ought to flee from it with great care. For our reckoning is not with our fellow-servants, but with our Master, and to him we shall give account for all done in our life. Let us prepare ourselves therefore for this tribunal. For even if he who transgresses this law be beyond everything revered and great, he shall certainly pay the penalty attaching to the transgression. For God is no respecter of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. How then and in what way is it possible to flee from this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? For one ought to show not only that the crime is grievous, but to give counsel how we may escape from it. Have you a wife, have you a servant, children, friends, acquaintance, neighbors? To all these enjoin caution on these matters. Custom is a grievous thing, terrible to supplant, and hard to guard against, and it often attacks us unwilling and unknowing; therefore in so far as you know the power of custom, to such an extent study to be freed from any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom, and transfer yourself to any other most useful one. For as that custom is often able to trip you up, though you are careful, and guardest yourself, and takest thought, and consideration, so if you transfer yourself to the good custom of abstaining from oaths, you will not be able, either involuntarily or carelessly, to fall into the fault of oaths. For custom is really great and has the power of nature. In order then that we do not continually distress ourselves let us transfer ourselves to another custom, and ask thou each one of your kindred and acquaintance this favor, that he advise you and exhort you to flee from oaths, and reprove you, when detected in them. For the watch over you which takes place on their part, is to them too counsel and a suggestion to what is right. For he who reproves another for oaths, will not himself easily fall into this pit. For much swearing is no ordinary pit, not only when it is about little matters but about the greatest. And we, whether buying vegetables, or quarrelling over two farthings, or in a rage with our servants and threatening them, always call upon God as our <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>. But a freeman, possessed of some barren dignity, you would not dare to call upon as <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in the market to such things; but even if you attempted it, you will pay the penalty of your insolence. But the King of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, the Lord of Angels, when disputing both about purchases and money, and what not, you drag in for a testimony. And how can these things be borne? Whence then should we escape from this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom? After setting those guards of which I spoke round us, let us fix on a specified time to ourselves for amendment, and adding thereto condemnation if, when the time has passed, we have not amended this. How long time will suffice for the purpose? I do not think that they who are very wary, and on the alert, and watchful about their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, should need more than ten days, so as to be altogether free from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom of oaths. But if after ten days we be detected swearing, let us add a penalty due to ourselves, and let us fix upon the greatest punishment and condemnation of the transgression; what then is this condemnation? This I do not fix upon, but will suffer you yourselves to determine the sentence. So we arrange matters in our own case, not only in respect of oaths but in respect of other defects, and fixing a time for ourselves, with most grievous punishments, if at any time we have fallen into them, shall come clean to our Master, and shall escape the fire of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, and shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ with boldness, to which may we all attain, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Father together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for ever and ever: <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<h2>Second Instruction</h2>

<p>To those about to be illuminated; and concerning <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who adorn themselves with plaiting of hair, and gold, and concerning those who have used omens, and amulets, and incantations, all which are foreign to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.</p>

<p>1. I have come to ask first of all for some fruit in return for the words lately said out of brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to you. For we do not speak in order that you should hear simply, but in order that you should remember what has been said, and may afford us evidence of this, by your works. Yea, rather, not us, but, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the secrets of the heart. On this account indeed instruction is so called, in order that even when we are absent, our discourse may instruct your hearts.  And be not surprised if, after an interval of ten days only, we have come asking for fruit from the seed sown. For in one day it is possible at once to let the seed fall, and to accomplish the harvest. For strengthened not by our own power alone, but by the influence which comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we are summoned to the conflict. Let as many therefore as have received what has been spoken, and have fulfilled it by their works, remain reaching forth to the things which are before. But let as many as have not yet arrived at this good achievement, arrive at it straightway, that they may dispel the condemnation which arises out of their sloth by their diligence for the future. For it is possible, it is indeed possible for him who has been very <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, by using diligence for the future to recover the whole loss of the time that is past. Wherefore, He says, <q>Today if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the day of provocation.</q>  And this, He says, exhorting and counselling us; that we should never despair, but so long as we are here, should have good hopes, and should lay hold on what is before us, and hasten towards the prize of our high calling of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This then let us do, and let us inquire into the names of this great gift. For as <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the greatness of this dignity makes those who are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with it more <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, so when it is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it renders them thankful, and makes them more earnest; and anyhow it would be disgraceful and ridiculous that they who enjoy such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what the names of it are intended to show forth. And why do I speak about this gift, for if you will consider the common name of our race, you will receive the greatest instruction and incentive to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For this name <q>Man,</q> we do not define according as they who are without define it, but as the Divine Scripture has bidden us. For a man is not merely whosoever has hands and feet of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, nor whosoever is rational only, but whosoever practices <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with boldness. Hear, at least, what he says concerning Job. For in saying that <q>there was a man in the land of Ausis,</q>  he does not describe him in those terms in which they who are without describe him, nor does he say this because he had two feet and broad nails, but he added the evidences of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and said, <q>just, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, fearing <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, eschewing every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deed</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190522"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse1">Job&nbsp;1:1</a></span> showing that this is a man; even as therefore another says, <q>Fear <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and keep his commandments, because this is the whole man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190523"><a href="../bible/ecc012.htm#verse13">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;12:13</a></span> But if the name man affords such a great incentive to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, much rather the term faithful. For you are called faithful on this account, because you have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yourself art entrusted from Him with righteousness, sanctification, cleansing of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, adoption, the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. He entrusted you with these, and handed them over to you. Thou in turn hast entrusted, and handed over other things to him, almsgiving, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, self-control and every other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And why do I say almsgiving? If you give him even a cup of cold water, you shall not indeed lose this, but even this he keeps with care against that day, and will restore it with overflowing abundance. For this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is wonderful, that he does not keep only that which has been entrusted to him, but in recompensing it increases it.</p>

<p>This too he has bidden you do according to your power, with what has been entrusted to you, to extend the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> which you have received, and to make the righteousness which comes from the laver brighter, and the gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> more radiant; even as therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did, increasing all the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which he received by his subsequent labors, and his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and his diligence. And look at the carefulness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; neither did he give the whole to you then, nor withhold the whole, but gave part, and promised part. And for what reason did he not give the whole then? In order that you might show your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> about Him, believing, on his promise alone, in what was not yet given. And for what reason again did he not there dispense the whole, but did give the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and righteousness and sanctification? In order that he might lighten your labors for you, and by what has been already given may also put you in good hope for that which is to come. On this account, too, you are about to be called newly-enlightened, because your light is ever new, if you will, and is never quenched. For this light of day, whether we will or no, the night succeeds, but darkness <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that light's ray. <q>For the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.</q>  Not so bright at least is the world, when the sunbeams come forth, as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shines and becomes brighter when it has received <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from the Spirit and learns more exactly the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the case. For when night prevails, and there is darkness, often a man has seen a coil of rope and has thought it was a serpent, and has fled from an approaching friend as from an enemy, and being aware of some noise, has become very much alarmed; but when the day has come, nothing of this sort could happen, but all appears just as it really is; which thing also occurs in the case of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For when <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has come, and driven away the darkness of the understanding, we learn the exact nature of things, and what was before dreadful to us becomes contemptible. For we no longer <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death, after learning exactly, from this sacred initiation, that death is not death, but a sleep and a seasonable slumber; nor poverty nor disease, nor any other such thing, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that we are on our way to a better life, undefiled and incorruptible, and free from all such vicissitudes.</p>

<p>2. Let us not therefore remain craving after the things of this life, neither after the luxury of the table, or costliness of raiment. For you have the most excellent of raiment, you have a spiritual table you have the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from on high, and Christ has become to you all things, your table, your raiment, your home, your head, your stem. <q>For as many of you as were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ, did put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190525"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians&nbsp;3:27</a></span> See how he has become raiment for you. Do you wish to learn how he becomes a table for you? <q>He who eats me,</q> says He, <q>as I live because of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, he also shall live because of me;</q>  and that he becomes a home for you, <q>he that eats my flesh abides in me, and I in him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190527"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;6:56</a></span> and that He is stem He says again, <q>I am the vine, you the branches,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190528"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;15:5</a></span> and that he is brother, and friend, and bride-groom, <q>I no longer call you servants: for you are my friends;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190529"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;15:15</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> again, <q>I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190530"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span> and again, <q>That he might be the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> among many brethren;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190531"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;8:29</a></span> and we become not his brethren only, but also his children, <q>For behold,</q> he says, <q>I and the children which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given me</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190532"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;8:18</a></span> and not this only, but His members, and His body. For as if what has been said were not enough to show forth the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and the good will which He has shown forth towards us, He has added another thing greater and nearer still, calling himself besides, our head. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> all these matters, beloved, requite your benefactor by the best conversation, and considering the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, adorn the members of your body; consider what you receive in your hand, and never suffer it to strike any one, nor shame what has been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with so great a gift by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of a blow. Consider what you receive in your hand, and keep it clean from all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and extortion; think that thou dost not receive this in your hand, but also puttest it to your mouth, and guard your tongue in purity from base and insolent words, <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, and all other such things. For it is disastrous that what is ministered to by such most dread <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and has been dyed red with such blood, and has become a golden sword, should be perverted to purposes of raillery, and insult, and buffoonery. Reverence the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has honoured it, and bring it not down to the vileness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but having reflected again that after the hand and the tongue, the heart receives this dread <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, do not ever weave a plot against your neighbor, but keep your thoughts pure from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Thus you shall be able to keep your eyes too, and your hearing safe. For is it not monstrous, after this mystic voice is borne from heaven&mdash; I mean the voice of the Cherubim&mdash; to defile your hearing with lewd songs, and dissolute melodies? And does it not deserve the utmost punishment if, with the same eyes with which you look upon the unspeakable and dread <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, you look upon harlots, and dost commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in your heart. You are called to a marriage, beloved: enter not in clad in sordid raiment, but take a robe suitable to the marriage. For if when men are called to a material marriage, though they be poorer than all others, they often possess themselves of or buy clean raiment, and so go to meet those who called them. Do thou too who hast been called to a spiritual marriage, and to a royal banquet, consider what kind of raiment it would be right for you to buy, but rather there is not even need to purchase, yea he himself who calls you gives it you gratis, in order that you may not be able to plead poverty in excuse. Keep, therefore, the raiment which you received. For if you lose it, you will not be able to use it henceforth, or to buy it. For this kind of raiment is nowhere sold. Have you heard how those who were initiated, in old time, groaned, and beat their breasts, their <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> thereupon exciting them? Beware then, beloved, that you do not at any time suffer like this. But how will you not suffer, if you dost not cast off the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> habit of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men? For this reason I said before, and speak now and will not cease speaking, if any has not rectified the defects in his morals, nor furnished himself with easily acquired <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, let him not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For the laver is able to remit former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but there is no little <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and no ordinary danger lest we return to them, and our remedy become a wound. For by how much greater the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is, by so much is the punishment more for those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> after these things.</p>

<p>3. In order, therefore, that we return not to our former vomit, let us henceforward discipline ourselves. For that we must repent beforehand, and desist from our former <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and so come forward for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, hear what John says, and what the leader of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> says to those who are about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For the one says, <q>Bring forth fruit worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, we have <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> to our Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190533"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;3:8</a></span> and the other says again to those who question him, <q>Repent ye and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190534"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse38">Acts&nbsp;2:38</a></span> Now he who repents, no longer touches the same matters of which he repented. On this account, also, we are bidden to say, <q>I renounce you, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> in order that we may never more return to him.  As therefore happens in the case of painters from life, so let it happen in your case. For they, arranging their boards, and tracing white lines upon them, and sketching the royal likeness in outline, before they apply the actual colors, rub out some lines, and change some for others, rectifying mistakes, and altering what is amiss with all freedom. But when they put on the coloring for good, it is no longer in their power to rub out again, and to change one thing for another, since they injure the beauty of the portrait, and the result becomes an eyesore. Consider that your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is the portrait; before therefore the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> coloring of the spirit comes, wipe out habits which have wrongly been implanted in you, whether swearing, or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, or insolence, or base talking, or jesting, or whatever else you have a habit of doing of things unlawful. Away with the habit, in order that you may not return to it, after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. The laver causes the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to disappear. Correct your habits, so that when the colors are applied, and the royal likeness is brought out, you may no more wipe them out in the future; and add damage and scars to the beauty which has been given you by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Restrain therefore <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, extinguish passion. Be not thou vexed, be sympathizing, be not exasperated, nor say, <q>I have been injured in regard to my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> No one is injured in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> if we do not injure ourselves in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and how this is, I now say. Has any one taken away your substance? He has not injured you in regard to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but your money. But if you cherish ill-will against him, you have injured yourself in regard to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For the money taken away has wrought you no damage, nay has even been profitable, but thou by not dismissing your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> will give account in the other world for this cherishing of ill-will. Has any one reviled you and insulted you. He has in no way injured your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and not even your body. Have you reviled in return and insulted? You have injured yourself in regard to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for for the words which you have said you are about to render account there; and this I wish you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> chiefly of all, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and faithful man, no one is able to injure in regard to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not even the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself; and not only is this wonderful, that God has made us inaccessible to all his designs, but that he has constituted us fit for the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and there is no hinderance, if we will, even though we be poor, weak in body, outcast, nameless, bondservants. For neither poverty, nor infirmity, nor deformity of body, nor servitude, nor any other of such things could ever become a hinderance to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and why do I say, poor, and a bondservant, and nameless? Even if you are a prisoner, not even this would be ever any hinderance to you as regards <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. And how this is I proceed to say. Has any of your household grieved you and provoked you? dismiss your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against him. Have bonds, and poverty, and obscurity been any hinderance to you in this respect? And why do I say hinderance? They have both helped and contributed to restrain <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Have you seen another prospering? Do not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> him. For not even in this case is poverty a bar. Again, whenever you need to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, do so with a sober and watchful <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and nothing shall be a bar even in that case. Show all meekness, forbearance, self-restraint, gravity. For these things need no external helps. And this especially is the chief point about <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, that it has no necessity for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, power, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, nor anything of that kind, but of a sanctified <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> alone, and it seeks for nothing more. And behold, also, the same thing happening in respect of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For if any one be lame, if he has had his eyes put out, if he be maimed in body, if he has fallen into the last extremity of weakness, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is not hindered from coming by any of these things. For it only seeks a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receiving it with readiness, and all these external things it passes over. For in the case of worldly soldiers, those who are about to enlist them for the army seek for stature of body and healthy condition, and it is not only necessary that he who is about to become a soldier should have these alone, but he must also be free. For if anybody be a slave, he is rejected. But the King of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> seeks for nothing of this kind, but receives slaves into his army, and aged people, and the languid in limb, and is not ashamed. What is more merciful than this? What could be more kind? For he seeks for what is in our own power, but they seek for what is not in our power. For to be a slave or free is not our doing. To be tall, again, or short is not in our own power, or to be aged, or well grown, and such like. But to be forbearing and kind, and so forth, are matters of our own choice; and God demands of us only those things of which we have control. And quite reasonably. For He does not call us to <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> because of his own need, but because of doing us kindness; but kings, because of services required by them; and they carry men off to an outward and material warfare, but He to a spiritual combat; and it is not only in the case of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, but in the case of the games also that one may see the same analogy. For they who are about to be brought into the theatre, do not descend to the contest until the herald himself takes them beneath the gaze of all, and leads them round, shouting out and saying, <q>Has any one a charge against this person?</q> although in that case the struggle is not concerned with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but with the body. Wherefore then do you demand <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of nobleness? But in this case there is nothing of the kind, but all is different, our contest not consisting of hand locked in hand, but in <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and excellence of mind. The president of our conflicts does the opposite. For he does not take us, and lead us round and say, <q>Has any one a charge against this man?</q> but cries out, Though all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, though <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, stand up with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and accuse him of extreme and unspeakable crimes, I reject him not, nor abhor him, but removing him from his accusers, and freeing him from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, thus I bring him to the contest. And this is very reasonable. For there indeed the president contributes nothing towards the victory, in the case of the combatants, but stands still in the midst. But here, the President of the contests for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> becomes a fellow-combatant, and helper, sharing with them the conflict against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>4. And not only is this the wonderful thing that he remits our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but that he not even reveals them nor makes them manifest and patent, nor compels us to come forward into the midst, and to tell out our <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, but bids us make our defense to him alone, and to confess ourselves to him. And yet among secular judges, if any tell any of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> or grave-riflers, when they are arrested, to tell their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and be quit of their punishment, they would accede to this with all readiness, despising the shame through desire of safety. But in this case there is nothing of this kind, but he both remits the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, nor compels us to marshal them in array before any spectators. But one thing alone he seeks, that he who enjoys this remission should learn the greatness of the gift. How is it not, therefore, absurd that in case where he does us service, he should be content with our testimony only, but in those where we serve him we seek for others as witnesses, and do a thing for ostentation's sake? While we wonder then at his kindliness, let us show forth our doings, and before all others let us curb the vehemence of our tongue, and not always be giving utterance. <q>For in the multitude of words there wants not transgression.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190537"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;10:19</a></span> If indeed then you have anything useful to say, open your lips. But if there be nothing necessary for you to say, be silent, for it is better. Are you a handicraftsman? As you sit at work, sing psalms. Do you not wish to sing with your mouth? Do this in your heart; a psalm is a great companion.  In this case you shall undergo nothing serious, but shall be able to sit in your workshop as in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. For not suitableness of place, but strictness of morals will afford us quiet. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, at least, pursuing his trade in a workshop suffered no injury to his own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note190538"><a href="../bible/act018.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;18:3</a></span> Do not thou therefore say, How can I, being a handicraftsman and a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man, be a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>? This is indeed the very reason why you may be a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. For poverty is far more conducive to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> for us than <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and work than idleness; since <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is even a hinderance to those who do not take heed. For when it is needful to dismiss <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, to extinguish <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, to curb passion, to offer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, to exhibit forbearance and meekness, kindliness and charity, when would poverty be a bar? For it is not possible by spending money to accomplish these things, but by exhibiting a right disposition; almsgiving especially needs money, but even it shines forth in greater degree through poverty. For she who spent the two mites was poorer than all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and yet surpassed all. <span class="stiki" id="note190539"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;21:2-4</a></span> Let us not then consider <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> to be anything great, nor gold to be better than clay. For the value of material things is not owing to their nature, but to our estimate of them. For if any one would inquire carefully, iron is much more necessary than gold. For the one contributes to no need of our life, but the other has furnished us with the greater part of our needs, ministering to countless arts; and why do I speak of a comparison between gold and iron? For these stones  are more necessary than precious stones. For of those nothing serviceable could be made, but out of these, houses and walls and cities are erected. But do thou show me what gain could be derived from these pearls, rather what harm would not happen? For in order that you may wear one pearl drop, countless poor people are pinched with hunger. What excuse will you hit upon? What pardon?</p>

<p>Do you wish to adorn your face? Do so not with pearls, but with modesty, and dignity. So your countenance will be more full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> in the eyes of your husband. For the other kind of adorning is wont to plunge him into a suspicion of jealousy, and into enmity, quarrelsomeness and strife, for nothing is more annoying than a face which is suspected. But the ornament of compassion and modesty casts out all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> suspicion, and will draw your partner to you more strongly than any bond. For natural beauty does not impart such comeliness to the face as does the disposition of him who beholds it, and nothing is so wont to produce that disposition as modesty and dignity; so that if any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> be comely, and her husband be ill affected towards her, she appears to him the most worthless of all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; and if she do not happen to be fair of face, but her husband be well affected towards her, she appears more comely than all. For sentence is given not according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of what is beheld, but according to the disposition of the beholders. Adorn your face then with modesty, dignity, pity, lovingkindness, charity, affection for your husband, forbearance, meekness, endurance of ill. These are the tints of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. By means of these you will attract <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings to be your lovers. By means of these you have God to commend you, and when God receives you, he will certainly win over your husband for you. For if the wisdom of a man illuminates his countenance, <span class="stiki" id="note190541"><a href="../bible/ecc008.htm#verse1">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;8:1</a></span> much more does the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> illuminate her face; and if you consider this to be a great ornament, tell me what will be the advantage of the pearls in that day? But why is it necessary to speak of that day, since it is possible to show all this from what happens now. When, then, they who thought fit to revile the emperor were dragged to the judgment hall, and were in danger of extreme measures being taken, then the mothers, and the wives, laying aside their necklaces, and their golden ornaments, and pearls, and all adornment, and golden raiment, wearing a simple and mean dress, and besprinkled with ashes, prostrated themselves before the doors of the judgment hall and thus won over the judges; and if in the case of these earthly courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, the golden ornaments, and the pearls, and the variegated dress would have been a snare and a betrayal, but forbearance, and meekness, and ashes, and tears, and mean garments persuaded the judge, much more would this take place in the case of that impartial and dread tribunal. For what reason will you be able to state, what defense, when the Master lays these pearls to your charge, and brings the poor who have perished with hunger into the midst? On this account <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said, <q>not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly raiment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190542"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:9</a></span> For therein would be a snare. And if we were to enjoy them continually, yet we shall lay them aside with death. But arising out of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> there is all security, and no vicissitude and changeableness, but here it makes us more secure, and also accompanies us there. Do you wish to possess pearls, and never to lay aside this <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>? Take off all ornament and place it in the hands of Christ through the poor. He will keep all your <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> for you, when He shall raise up your body with much radiancy. Then He shall invest you with better <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and greater ornament, since this present is mean and absurd. Consider then whom you wish to please, and for whose sake you put on this ornament, not in order that the ropemaker and the coppersmith and the huckster may admire. Then are you not ashamed, nor do you blush when you show yourself to them? Doing all on their account whom you do not consider worthy of accosting.</p>

<p>How then will you laugh this fancy to scorn? If you will remember that word, which you sent forth when thou were initiated, I renounce you, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and your pomp, and your service. For the frenzy about pearls is a pomp of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. For you received gold not in order that you might bind it on to your body, but in order that you might release and nourish the poor. Say therefore constantly, I renounce you, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. Nothing is more safe than this word if we shall prove it by our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>.</p>

<p>5. This I think it right that you who are about to be initiated should learn. For this word is a covenant with the Master. And just as we, when we buy slaves, first ask those who are being sold if they are willing to be our servants: So also does Christ. When He is about to receive you into service, He first asks if you wish to leave that cruel and relentless tyrant, and He receives covenants from you. For his service is not forced upon you. And see the lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For we, before we put down the price, ask those who are being sold, and when we have learned that they are willing, then we put down the price. But Christ not so, but He even put down the price for us all; his precious blood. For, He says, you were bought with a price. <span class="stiki" id="note190543"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> Notwithstanding, not even then does He compel those who are unwilling, to serve him; but except you have <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, He says, and of your own accord and will determinest to enroll yourself under my rule, I do not compel, nor force you. And <em>we</em> should not have chosen to buy <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> slaves. But if we should at any time have so chosen, we buy them with a perverted choice, and put down a corresponding price for them. But Christ, buying ungrateful and lawless slaves, put down the price of a servant of first quality, nay rather much more, and so much greater that neither speech nor thought can set forth its greatness. For neither giving heaven, nor earth, nor sea, but giving up that which is more valuable than all these, his own blood, thus He bought us. And after all these things, he does not require of us witnesses, or registration, but is content with the single word, if you say it from your heart. <q>I renounce you, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and your pomp,</q> has included all. Let us then say this, <q>I renounce you, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,</q> as men who are about in that world at that day to have that word demanded of them, and let us keep it in order that we may then return this deposit safe. But <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan's</a> pomps are theatres, and the circus, and all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and observance of days, and incantations and omens.</p>

<p><q>And what are omens?</q> says one. Often when going forth from his own house he has seen a one-eyed or lame man, and has shunned him as an omen. This is a pomp of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. For meeting the man does not make the day turn out ill, but to live in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. When you go forth, then, beware of one thing&mdash; that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> does not meet you. For this it is which trips us up. And without this the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will be able to do us no harm. What do you say? You see a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and shunnest him as an omen, and dost not see the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, how he sets you at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with him who has done you no wrong, how he makes you the enemy of your brother on no just pretext; but God has bidden us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our enemies; but you are turned away from him who did you no wrong, having nothing to charge him with, and do you not consider how great is the absurdity, how great the shame, rather how great is the danger? Can I speak of anything more absurd? I am ashamed, indeed, and I blush: But for your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation's</a> sake, I am, I am compelled to speak of it. If a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> meet him he says the day becomes unsuccessful; but if a harlot meet him, it is propitious, and profitable, and full of much business; are you ashamed? And do you smite your foreheads, and bend to the ground? But do not this on account of the words which I have spoken, but of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which have been done. See then, in this case, how the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> hid his snare, in order that we might turn away from the modest, but salute and be friendly to the unchaste. For since he has heard Christ saying that <q>He who looks on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to desire her, has already committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190544"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> and has seen many get the better of unchastity, wishing by another wrong to cast them again into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, by this superstitious observance he gladly persuades them to pay attention to whorish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.</p>

<p>And what is one to say about them who use charms and amulets, and encircle their heads and feet with golden coins of Alexander of Macedon. Are these our hopes, tell me, that after the cross and death of our Master, we should place our hopes of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> on an image of a Greek king? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what great result the cross has achieved? It has abolished death, has extinguished <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, has made Hades useless, has undone the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and is it not worth trusting for the health of the body? It has raised up the whole world, and do you not take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in it? And what would you be worthy to suffer, tell me? Thou dost not only have amulets always with you, but incantations bringing drunken and half-witted old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> into your house, and are you not ashamed, and do you not blush, after so great <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, to be terrified at such things? And there is a graver thing than this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For when we deliver these exhortations, and lead them away, thinking that they defend themselves, they say, that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who makes these incantations, and utters nothing else than the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On this account I especially <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> and turn away from her, because she makes use of the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with a view to ribaldry. For even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> uttered the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but still they were <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and thus they used to say to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you who you are, the Holy One of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190545"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse24">Mark&nbsp;1:24</a></span> and notwithstanding, he rebuked them, and drove them away. On this account, then, I beseech you to cleanse yourselves from this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and to keep hold of this word as a staff; and just as without sandals, and cloak, no one of you would choose to go down to the market-place, so without this word never enter the market-place, but when you are about to pass over the threshold of the gateway, say this word first: I leave your ranks, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and your pomp, and your service, and I join the ranks of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And never go forth without this word. This shall be a staff to you, this your armor, this an impregnable fortress, and accompany this word with the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> on your forehead. For thus not only a man who meets you, but even the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself, will be unable to hurt you at all, when he sees you everywhere appearing with these weapons; and discipline yourself by these means henceforth, in order that when you receive the seal  you may be a well-equipped soldier, and planting your trophy against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, may receive the crown of righteousness, which may it be the lot of us all to obtain, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and lovingkindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, with whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Father and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> for ever and ever&mdash; <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
