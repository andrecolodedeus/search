<h1>Letter 101</h1>

<p> <em>From Anatolius, Bishop of Constantinople, to Leo.</em></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This deals with much the same subjects as Letter 98 from Anatolius' own standpoint; Chapter 3 is translated here as illustrating Letter 98, Chapter 3.</span> </p>

<h2>III. He describes the circumstances under which the doctrine of the Incarnation had been formulated by the Synod.</h2>

<p>But since after passing judgment upon him we had to come to an agreement with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and tears upon a definition of the right Faith; for that was the chief reason for the Emperor's summoning the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, at which your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> was present in the spirit with us, and wrought with us by the God-fearing men who were sent from you; we, having the protection of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and beautiful <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Euphemia, have all given ourselves to this important matter with all deliberateness. And as the occasion demanded that all the assembled <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should publish a unanimous decision for clearness and for an explicit statement of the Faith in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> the Lord God who is found and revealed even to those who seek Him not, yes, even to those who ask not for Him <span class="stiki" id="note360444"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;65:1</a></span>, in spite of some attempts to resist at first, nevertheless showed us His Truth, and ordained that it should be written down and proclaimed by all unanimously and without gainsaying, which thus confirmed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the strong, and invited into the way of Truth all who were swerving therefrom. And, indeed, after unanimously setting our names to this document, we who have assembled in this ecumenical Synod in the name of the Faith of the same most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and triumphant <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, Euphemia, and of our most religious and Christ-loving Emperor Marcian, and our most religious and in all things most faithful daughter the Empress Pulcheria Augusta, with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, having laid on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar the definition written in accordance with your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> epistle for the confirmation of our Father.' Faith, presented it to their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> care; for thus they had asked to receive it, and, having received it, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with us their Master Christ, who had driven away all the mist of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and had graciously made clear the word of Truth. And in this way was simultaneously established the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the agreement of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> concerning the pure Faith by the Saviour's mercy.</p>
