<h1>Letter 102</h1>

<p> <em>To Bishop Basilius.</em> </p>

<p>There is nothing remarkable in the reproaches that are directed against me being heard in silence by men who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me; but that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> should not refute the lies of my revilers, or at least should do so only to a certain extent, and with no great heartiness, passes the belief of any one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> your character and conduct. And I say this not because friendship ought to be preferred to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but because the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is on the side of friendship. Your reverence has very often heard me preaching in church, and, in other assemblies where I have spoken on doctrinal questions; you have listened to what I have said, and I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of any occasion on which you have found fault with me for expressing unorthodox opinions. But what is the case at the present moment? Why in the world, my dear friend, do you not utter a word against <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, while you allow a friend to be <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to be assailed? If this is because you disregard the helpless and insignificant, remember the plain proclamation of the commandment of the Lord <q>Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones which <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in me, for I say unto you that in heaven their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.</q>  If however it is the influence of my <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> which imposes silence upon you, you must listen to the other law which says <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the person of the mighty</q>  and <q>Judge righteous judgment</q>  and <q>You shall not follow a multitude to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q>  and <q>He that shuts his eyes from seeing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and stops his ears from hearing of blood.</q>  You may find innumerable similar passages in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, which I have thought it needless to collect when writing to a man brought up in the divine oracles, and watering <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people with his teaching. But this I will say, that we shall all stand before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and shall give account of our words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. I, who for every other reason dread this tribunal, now that I am encompassed with <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, find my chief consolation in the thought of it.</p>
