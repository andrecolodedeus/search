<h1>Letter 104</h1>

<p> <em>To Flavianus</em>,  <em>Bishop of Constantinople.</em></p>

<p>I have already in another letter informed your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> how openly the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> of our teaching are <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandering</a> us.  Now in like manner by means of the very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> I do the same, having not only these as witnesses of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of my teaching but also countless other men who are my hearers in the churches of the East. Above and beyond all these I have my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and Him who sees my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> too how the divine Apostle often appealed to the testimony of his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, for <q>our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a></q>  and again <q>I say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in Christ I lie not, my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> also bearing me <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q>  Know then, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and godly sir, that no one has ever at any time heard us preaching two sons; in fact this doctrine seems to me abominable and impious, for there is one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> through whom are all things. Him I acknowledge both as everlasting God and as man in the end of days, and I give Him one worship as only begotten. I have learned however the distinction between flesh and Godhead, for the union is unconfounded. Thus drawn up as it were in battle array to oppose the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius, we very easily refute the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> hazarded by them against the only begotten, by applying what was spoken in humility about the Lord, and suitably to His assumed nature, to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and, on the other hand, what becomes the divine and signifies the divine nature, to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not dividing Him into two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but teaching that both the former and latter attributes belong to the only begotten, the latter to Him as God the Creator and Lord of all, and the former as made man on our account. For <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says that He was made man, not by mutation of the Godhead, but by assumption of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>. This the divine Apostle openly says in the words <q>For verily He took not on Him the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but He took on Him the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, wherefore in all things it behooved Him to be made like His brethren.</q>  And again <q>Now to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and his seed were the promises made: he says not and to seeds, as of many; but as of one, and to your seed, which is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> </p>

<p>These and similar passages have been cut out of <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> by Simon, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and the man who is named after his maniacal <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.  So they style the Master Christ God only, and describe Him as having nothing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> about Him, but appearing in imagination and appearance as man to men. On the other hand the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and Eunomians say that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> assumed only a body, and that He Himself supplied the place of a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the body. And <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> describes the Master's body as endued with a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;  but, deriving, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence, the idea of a distinction between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and intelligence,  deprives intelligence of its share in the achieved <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.  The teaching of the divine Apostles lays down on the contrary that a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> both reasonable and intelligent was assumed together with flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of which the hope is held out to them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> is complete.</p>

<p>There is yet another gang of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who hold differently. Photinus,  Marcellus,  and <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>,  assert that our Lord and God was only man. When arguing with these we are under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of advancing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the Godhead, and of showing that the Master Christ is everlasting God. When, on the other hand, we are contending with the former faction, which calls <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> God only, we are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to marshal against them the forces of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, and collect from it evidence of the assumption of the manhood. For a physician must use remedies appropriate to the disease, and suit the medicine to the case.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, I beseech your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to scatter the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> raised against me, and bridle the tongues now vainly reviling me. For, after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, I worship one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and denounce as impious all who hold otherwise. Deign, sir, to give me too your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, I may reach the other side of the ocean of danger, and drop my anchor in the windless haven of the Lord.</p>
