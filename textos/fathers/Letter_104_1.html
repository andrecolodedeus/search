<h1>Letter 104</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To the prefect Modestus</em>. </p>

<p>Merely to write to so great a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even though there be no other reason, must be esteemed a great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. For communication with personages of high distinction confers <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> upon all to whom it is permitted. My supplication, however, is one which I am driven by necessity to make to your excellency, in my great distress at the condition of my whole country. Bear with me, I beg you, kindly and in accordance with your own characters and reach a helping hand to my country, now beaten to the knee. The immediate object of my entreaty is as follows. By the old census, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>,  were left exempt. The recent registrars, however, without any authority from your lordship, have enrolled them, except that in some cases a few were granted immunity on the score of age. I ask, then, that you will leave us this memorial of your beneficence, to preserve through all coming time your good fame; that in accordance with the old law the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> be exempt from contribution. I do not ask the remission to be conceded personally and individually to those who are now included, in which case the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> will pass to their successors, who may not always be worthy of the sacred ministry. I would suggest that some general concession be made to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, according to the form in the open register, so that the exemption may be given in each place to ministers by the rulers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This boon is sure to bring undying <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to your excellency for your good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and will <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> many to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the imperial house. It will also really be profitable to the government, if we afford the relief of exemption, not generally to all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but to those who from time to time are in distress. This, as any one who chooses may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is the course we actually pursue when we are at liberty.</p>
