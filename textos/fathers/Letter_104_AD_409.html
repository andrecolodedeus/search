<h1>Letter 104 (A.D. 409)</h1>

<p> <em>To Nectarius, My Noble Lord and Brother, Justly Worthy of All Honour and Esteem, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. I have read the letter which you kindly sent in answer to mine. Your reply comes at a very long interval after the time when I dispatched my letter to you. For I had written an answer to you  when my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother and colleague Possidius was still with us, before he had entered on his voyage; but the letter which you have been pleased to entrust to him for me I received on March 27th, about eight months after I had written to you. The reason why my communication was so late in reaching you, or yours so late in being sent to me, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Perhaps your <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> has only now dictated the reply which your <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> formerly disdained. If this be the explanation, I wonder what has occasioned the change. Have you perchance heard some report, which is as yet unknown to us, that my brother Possidius had obtained authority for proceedings of greater severity against your citizens, whom&mdash; you must excuse me for saying this&mdash; he loves in a way more likely to promote their welfare than you do yourself? For your letter shows that you apprehended something of this kind when you charge me to set before my eyes <q>the appearance presented by a town from which men doomed to torture are dragged forth,</q> and to <q>think of the lamentations of mothers and wives, of sons and of fathers; of the shame felt by those who may return, set at liberty indeed, but having undergone the torture; and of the sorrow and groaning which the sight of their wounds and scars must renew.</q>  Far be it from us to demand the infliction, either by ourselves or by any one, of such hardships upon any of our enemies! But, as I have said, if report has brought any such measures of severity to your ears, give us a more clear and particular account of the things reported, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> either what to do in order to prevent these things from being done, or what answer we must make in order to disabuse the minds of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the rumour.</p>

<p>2. Examine more carefully my letter, to which you have so reluctantly sent a reply, for I have in it made my views sufficiently plain; but through not remembering, as I suppose, what I had written, you have in your reply made reference to sentiments widely differing from mine, and wholly unlike them. For, as if quoting from <a href="../cathen/10174a.htm">memory</a> what I had written, you have inserted in your letter what I never said at all in mine. You say that the concluding sentence of my letter was, <q>that neither capital punishment nor bloodshed is demanded in order to compensate for the wrong done to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but that the offenders must be deprived of that which they most <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to lose;</q> and then, in showing how great a calamity this imports, you add and connect with my words that you <q>deliberately judge&mdash; though you may perhaps be mistaken&mdash; that it is a more grievous thing to be deprived of one's possessions than to be deprived of life.</q> And in order to expound more clearly the kind of possessions to which you refer, you go on to say that. it must be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me, <q>as an observation frequently recurring in the whole range of literature, that death terminates the experience of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, but that a life of indigence only confers upon us an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of wretchedness.</q> From which you have drawn the conclusion that it is <q>worse to live miserably than to put an end to our miseries by death.</q></p>

<p>3. Now I for my part do not recollect reading anywhere&mdash; either in our [<a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>] literature, to which I confess that I was later of applying my mind than I could now wish that I had been, or in your [Pagan] literature, which I studied from my childhood&mdash; that <q>a life of indigence only confers upon us an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of wretchedness.</q> For the poverty of the industrious is never in itself a crime; nay, it is to some extent a means of withdrawing and restraining men from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And therefore the circumstance that a man has lived in poverty here is no ground for apprehending that this shall procure for him after this brief life <q>an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of wretchedness;</q> and in this life which we spend on earth it is utterly impossible for any misery to be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, seeing that this life cannot be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, nay, is not of long duration even in those who attain to the most advanced old age. In the writings referred to, I for my part have read, not that in this life&mdash; as you think, and as you allege that these writings  frequently affirm&mdash; there can be an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of wretchedness, but rather that this life itself which we here enjoy is short. Some, indeed but not all, of your authors have said that death is the end of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>: that is indeed the opinion of the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, and of such others as <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be mortal. But those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> whom Cicero designates <q>consulates</q> in a certain sense, because he attaches great weight to their authority, are of opinion that when our last hour on earth comes the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not annihilated, but removes from its tenement, and continues in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> for a state of blessedness or of misery, according to that which a man's actions, whether good or bad, claim as their due recompense. This agrees with the teaching of our sacred writings, with which I wish that I were more fully conversant. Death is therefore the end of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>&mdash; but only in the case of those whose life is, pure, religious, upright, and blameless; not in the case of those who, inflamed with passionate desire for the trifles and vanities of time, are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be miserable by the utter perversion of their desires, though meanwhile they esteem themselves <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, and are after death compelled not only to accept as their lot, but to realize in their experience far greater miseries.</p>

<p>4. These sentiments, therefore, being frequently expressed both in some of your own authors, whom you deem worthy of greater esteem, and in all our Scriptures, be it yours, O worthy lover of the country which is on earth your fatherland, to dread on behalf of your countrymen a life of luxurious indulgence rather than a life of indigence; or if you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> a life of indigence, warn them that the poverty which is to be more studiously shunned is that of the man who, though surrounded with abundance of worldly possessions, is, through the insatiable eagerness wherewith he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covets</a> these, kept always in a state of want, which, to use the words of your own authors, neither plenty nor scarcity can relieve. In the letter, however, to which you reply, I did not say that those of your citizens who are enemies to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were to be corrected by being reduced to that extremity of indigence in which the necessaries of life are wanting, and to which succour is brought by that compassion of which you have thought it incumbent on you to point out to me that it is professed by us in the whole plan of those labours wherein we <q>support the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, minister healing to the diseased, and apply remedies to the bodies of those who are in pain;</q> albeit, even such extremity of want as this would be more profitable than abundance of all things, if abused to the gratification of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>. But far be it from me to think that those about whom we are treating should be reduced to such destitution by the measures of coercion proposed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>5. Though you did not consider it worth while to read my letter over when it was to be answered, perhaps you have at least so far esteemed it as to preserve it, in order to its being brought to you when you at any time might desire it and call for it; if this be the case, look over it again, and mark carefully my words: you will assuredly find in it one thing to which, in my opinion, you must admit that you have made no reply. For in that letter occur the words which I now quote: <q>We do not desire to gratify our <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> by vindictive retribution for the past, but we are concerned to make provision in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> merciful spirit for the future. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men have something in respect to which they may be punished, and that by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, in a merciful way, and so as to promote their own profit and well-being. For they have these three things&mdash; life and health of the body, the means of supporting that life, and the means and opportunities of living a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life. Let the two former remain untouched in the possession of those who repent of their crime; this we desire, and this we spare no pains to secure. But as to the third, if it please God to deal with it as a decaying or diseased part, which must be removed with the pruning-knife, He will in such punishment prove the greatness of his compassion.</q>  If you had read over these words of mine again, when you were pleased to write your reply, you would have looked upon it rather as an unkind insinuation than as a necessary duty to address to me a petition not only for deliverance from death, but also for exemption from torture, on behalf of those regarding whom I said that we wished to leave unimpaired their possession of bodily life and health. Neither was there any ground for your apprehending our inflicting a life of indigence and of dependence upon others for daily bread on those regarding whom I had said that we desired to secure to them the second of the possessions named above, viz. the means of supporting life. But as to their third possession, viz. the means and opportunities of living wickedly, that is to say&mdash; passing over other things&mdash; their silver with which they constructed those images of their false gods, in whose protection or adoration or unhallowed worship an attempt was made even to destroy the church of God by fire, and the provision made for relieving the poverty of very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> was given up to become the spoil of a wretched mob, and blood was freely shed&mdash; why, I ask, does your patriotic heart dread the stroke which shall cut this away, in order to prevent a fatal boldness from being in everything fostered and confirmed by impunity? This I beg you to discuss fully, and to show me in well-considered arguments what wrong there is in this; mark carefully what I say, lest under the form of a petition in regard to what I am saying you appear to bring against us an indirect accusation.</p>

<p>6. Let your countrymen be well reported of for their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> manners, not for their superfluous <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; we do not wish them to be reduced through coercive measures on our account to the plough of Quintius [Cincinnatus], or to the hearth of Fabricius. Yet by such extreme poverty these statesmen of the Roman republic not only did not incur the contempt of their fellow citizens, but were on that very account peculiarly dear to them, and esteemed the more qualified to administer the resources of their country. We neither desire nor endeavour to reduce the estates of your rich men, so that in their possession should remain no more than ten pounds of silver, as was the case with Ruffinus, who twice held the consulship, which amount the stern censorship of that time laudably required to be still further reduced as culpably large. So much are we influenced by the prevailing sentiments of a degenerate age in dealing more tenderly with minds that are very feeble, that to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> clemency the measure which seemed just to the censors of that time appears unduly severe; yet you see how great is the difference between the two cases, the question being in the one, whether the mere fact of possessing ten pounds of silver should be dealt with as a punishable crime, and in the other, whether any one, after committing other very great crimes, should be permitted to retain the sum aforesaid in his possession; we only ask that what in those days was itself a crime be in our days made the punishment of crime. There is, however, one thing which can be done, and ought to be done, in order that, on the one hand, severity may not be pushed even so far as I have mentioned, and that, on the other, men may not, presuming on impunity, run into excess of exultation and rioting, and thus furnish to other unhappy men an example by following which they would become liable to the severest and most unheard of punishments. Let this at least be granted by you, that those who attempt with fire and sword to destroy what are necessaries to us be made afraid of losing those luxuries of which they have a pernicious abundance. Permit us also to confer upon our enemies this benefit, that we prevent them, by their fears about that which it would do them no harm to forfeit, from attempting to that which would bring harm to themselves. For this is to be termed <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> prevention, not punishment of crime; this is not to impose penalties, but to protect men from becoming liable to penalties.</p>

<p>7. When any one uses measures involving the infliction of some pain, in order to prevent an inconsiderate person from incurring the most dreadful punishments by becoming accustomed to crimes which yield him no advantage, he is like one who pulls a boy's hair in order to prevent him from provoking serpents by clapping his hands at them; in both cases, while the acting of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is vexatious to its object, no member of the body is injured, whereas safety and life are endangered by that from which the person is deterred. We confer a benefit upon others, not in every case in which we do what is requested, but when we do that which is not hurtful to our petitioners. For in most cases we serve others best by not giving, and would injure them by giving, what they desire. Hence the proverb, <q>Do not put a sword in a child's hand.</q> <q>Nay,</q> says Cicero, <q>refuse it even to your only son. For the more we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> any one, the more are we bound to avoid entrusting to him things which are the occasion of very dangerous faults.</q> He was referring to riches, if I am not mistaken, when he made these observations. Wherefore it is for the most part an advantage to themselves when certain things are removed from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in whose keeping it is hazardous to leave them, lest they abuse them. When surgeons see that a gangrene must be cut away or cauterized, they often, out of compassion, turn a deaf ear to many cries. If we had been indulgently forgiven by our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and teachers in our tender years on every occasion on which, being found in a fault, we begged to be let off, which of us would not have grown up intolerable? Which of us would have learned any useful thing? Such punishments are administered by wise care, not by wanton cruelty. Do not, I beseech you, in this matter think only how to accomplish that which you are requested by your countrymen to do, but carefully consider the matter in all its bearings. If you overlook the past, which cannot now be undone, consider the future; wisely give heed, not to the desire, but to the real interests of the petitioners who have applied to you. We are convicted of unfaithfulness towards those whom we profess to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, if our only care is lest, by refusing to do what they ask of us, their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards us be diminished. And what becomes of that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which even your own literature commends, in the ruler of his country who studies not so much the wishes as the welfare of his people?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>8. You say <q>it is of no importance what the quality of the fault may be in any case in which forgiveness is craved.</q> In this you would state the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> if the matter in question were the punishment and not the correction of men. Far be it from a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> heart to be carried away by the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of revenge to inflict punishment on any one. Far be it from a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, when forgiving any one his fault, to do otherwise than either anticipate or at least promptly answer the petition of him who asks forgiveness; but let his purpose in doing this be, that he may overcome the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the man who has offended him, and to render <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and to be inflamed with rage prompting him, if not to do an injury, at least to desire to see the infliction of the penalties appointed by law; let it not be that he may relieve himself from considering the offender's interest, exercising foresight on his behalf, and restraining him from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> actions. For it is possible, on the one hand, that, moved by more vehement hostility, one may neglect the correction of a man whom he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> bitterly, and, on the other hand, that by correction involving the infliction of some pain one may secure the improvement of another whom he dearly loves.</p>

<p>9. I grant that, as you write, <q>penitence procures forgiveness, and blots out the offense,</q> but it is that penitence which is practised under the influence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, and which has regard to the future judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not that penitence which is for the time professed or pretended before men, not to secure the cleansing of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for ever from the fault, but only to deliver from present apprehension of pain the life which is so soon to perish. This is the reason why in the case of some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who confessed their fault, and asked forgiveness for having been involved in the guilt of that crime&mdash;either by their not protecting the church when in danger of being burned, or by their appropriating a portion of the property which the miscreants carried off&mdash;we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the pain of repentance had borne fruit, and considered it sufficient for their correction, because in their hearts is found that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by which they could realize what they ought to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> from the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But how can there be any healing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in the repentance of those who not only fail to acknowledge, but even persist in mocking and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> Him who is the fountain of forgiveness? At the same time, towards these men we do not cherish any feeling of enmity in our hearts, which are naked and opened unto the eyes of Him whose judgment both in this life and in the life to come we dread, and in whose help we place our hope. But we think that we are even taking measures for the benefit of these men, if, seeing that they do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we inspire <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in them by doing something whereby their folly is chastened, while their real interests suffer no wrong. We thus prevent that God whom they despise from being more grievously provoked by their greater crimes, to which they would be emboldened by a disastrous assurance of impunity, and we prevent their assurance of impunity from being set forth with even more mischievous effect as an encouragement to others to imitate their example. In fine, on behalf of those for whom you make intercession to us, we intercede before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, beseeching Him to turn them to Himself, and to teach them the exercise of genuine and salutary repentance, purifying their hearts by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>10. Behold, then, how we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> those men against whom you suppose us to be full of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>&mdash;loving them, you must permit me to say, with a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> and profitable than you yourself cherish towards them; for we plead on their behalf that they may escape much greater afflictions, and obtain much greater blessings. If you also loved these men, not in the mere earthly affections of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but with that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is the heavenly gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and if you were sincere in writing to me that you gave ear with pleasure to me when I was recommending to you the worship and religion of the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you would not only wish for your countrymen the blessings which we seek on their behalf, but you would yourself by your example lead them to their possession. Thus would the whole business of your interceding with us be concluded with abundant and most reasonable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. Thus would your title to that heavenly fatherland, in regard to which you say that you welcomed my counsel that you should fix your eye upon it, be earned by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercise of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the country which gave you birth, when seeking to make sure to your fellow citizens, not the vain dream of temporal <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, nor a most perilous exemption from the due punishment of their faults, but the gracious gift of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness.</p>

<p>11. You have here a frank avowal of the thoughts and desires of my heart in this matter. As to what lies concealed in the counsels of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I confess it is unknown to me; I am but a man; but whatever it be, His counsel stands most sure, and incomparably excels in equity and in wisdom all that can be conceived by the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. With <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is it said in our books, <q>There are many devices in a man's heart; but the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112375"><a href="../bible/pro019.htm#verse21">Proverbs&nbsp;19:21</a></span> Wherefore, as to what time may bring forth, as to what may arise to simplify or complicate our procedure, in short, as to what desire may suddenly be awakened by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of losing or the hope of retaining present possessions; whether God shall show Himself so displeased by what they have done that they shall be punished with the more weighty and severe sentence of a disastrous impunity, or shall appoint that they shall be compassionately corrected in the manner which we propose, or shall avert whatever terrible doom was being prepared for them, and convert it into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by some more stern but more salutary correction, leading to their turning unfeignedly to seek mercy not from men but from Himself&mdash;all this He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. Why, then, should your Excellency and I be spending toil in vain over this matter before the time? Let us for a little while lay aside a care the hour of which has not yet come, and, if you please, let us occupy ourselves with that which is always pressing. For there is no time at which it is not both suitable and necessary for us to consider in what way we can please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because for a man to attain completely in this life to such perfection that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever shall remain in him is either impossible or (if perchance any attain to it) extremely difficult: wherefore without delay we ought to flee at once to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Him to whom we may address with perfect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the words which were addressed to some illustrious man by a poet, who declared that he had borrowed the lines from a Cum&aelig;an oracle, or ode of prophetic inspiration: <q>With you as our leader, the obliteration of all remaining traces of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall deliver the earth from perpetual alarm.</q>  For with Him as our leader, all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are blotted out and forgiven; and by His way we are brought to that heavenly fatherland, the thought of which as a dwelling-place pleased you greatly when I was to the utmost of my power commending it to your affection and desire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>12. But since you said that all <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a> by diverse roads and pathways aspire to that one dwelling-place, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest, perchance, while supposing that the way in which you are now found tends there, you should be somewhat reluctant to embrace the way which alone leads men to heaven. Observing, however, more carefully the word which you used, I think that it is not presumptuous for me to expound its meaning somewhat differently; for you did not say that all <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a> by diverse roads and pathways reach heaven, or reveal, or find, or enter, or secure that blessed land, but by saying in a phrase deliberately weighed and chosen that all <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a> aspire to it, you have indicated, not the fruition, but the desire of heaven as common to all <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a>. You have in these words neither shut out the one religion which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, nor admitted other <a href="../cathen/12783a.htm">religions</a> which are false; for certainly the way which brings us to the goal aspires thitherward, but not every way which aspires thitherward brings us to the place wherein all who are brought there are unquestionably blest. Now we all wish, that is, we aspire, to be blest; but we cannot all achieve what we wish, that is, we do not all obtain what we aspire to. That man, therefore, obtains heaven who walks in the way which not only aspires thitherward, but actually brings him there, separating himself from others who keep to the ways which aspire heavenward without finally reaching heaven. For there would be no wandering if men were content to aspire to nothing, or if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which men aspire to were obtained. If, however, in using the expression <q>diverse ways,</q> you meant me not to understand contrary ways, but different ways, in the sense in which we speak of diverse precepts, which all tend to build up a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life&mdash;one enjoining <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, another patience or <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or mercy, and the like&mdash;in roads and pathways which are only in this sense diverse, that country is not only aspired unto but actually found. For in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> we read both of ways and of a way&mdash;of ways, <em> e.g.</em> in the words, <q>I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners shall be converted unto You;</q>  of a way, <em>e.g.</em> in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>Teach me Your way, O Lord; I will walk in Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  Those ways and this way are not different; but in one way are comprehended all those of which in another place the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> says, <q>All the ways of the Lord are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  The careful study of these ways furnishes theme for a long discourse, and for most delightful meditation; but this I shall defer to another time if it be required.</p>

<p>13. In the meantime, however&mdash;and this, I think, may suffice in the present reply to your Excellency,&mdash; seeing that Christ has said, <q>I am the way,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112380"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> it is in Him that mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are to be sought: if we seek these in any other way, we must go astray, following a path which aspires to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> goal, but does not lead men there. For example, if we resolved to follow the way indicated in the maxim which you mentioned, <q>All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are alike,</q>  would it not lead us into hopeless exile from that fatherland of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and blessedness? For could anything more absurd and senseless be said, than that the man who has laughed too rudely, and the man who has furiously set his city on fire, should be judged as having committed equal crimes? This opinion, which is not one of many diverse ways leading to the heavenly dwelling-place, but a perverse way leading inevitably to most fatal <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, you have judged it necessary to quote from certain <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, not because you concurred in the sentiment, but because it might help your plea for your fellow citizens&mdash; that we might forgive those whose rage set our church in flames on the same terms as we would forgive those who may have assailed us with some insolent reproach.</p>

<p>14. But reconsider with me the reasoning by which you supported your position. You say, <q>If, as is the opinion of some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, all faults are alike, pardon ought to be bestowed upon all without distinction.</q> Thereafter, labouring apparently to prove that all faults are alike, you go on to say, <q>One of our citizens may have spoken somewhat rudely: this was a fault; another may have perpetrated an insult or an injury: this was equally a fault.</q> This is not teaching <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but advancing, without any evidence in its support, a perversion of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For to your statement, <q>this was equally a fault,</q> we at once give direct contradiction. You demand, perhaps, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>; but I reply, What <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> have you given of your statement? Are we to hear as evidence your next sentence, <q>Another may have violently taken away what was not his own: this is reckoned a misdemeanour</q>? Here you own yourself to be ashamed of the maxim which you quoted; you had not the assurance to say that this was equally a fault, but you say <q>it is reckoned a misdemeanour.</q> But the question here is not whether this also is reckoned a misdemeanour, but whether this offense and the others which you mentioned are faults equal in demerit, unless, of course, they are to be pronounced equal because they are both offenses; in which case the mouse and the elephant must be pronounced equal because they are both animals, and the fly and the eagle because they both have wings.</p>

<p>15. You go still further, and make this proposition: <q>Another may have attacked buildings devoted to secular or to sacred purposes: he ought not for this crime to be placed beyond the reach of pardon.</q> In this sentence you have indeed come to the most flagrant crime of your fellow citizens, in speaking of injury done to sacred buildings; but even you have not affirmed that this is a crime equal only to the utterance of an insolent word. You have contented yourself with asking, on behalf of those who were guilty of this, that forgiveness which is rightly asked from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> on the ground of their overflowing compassion, not on the ground of an alleged equality of all offenses. I have already quoted a sentence of Scripture, <q>All the ways of the Lord are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> They shall therefore find mercy if they do not <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This mercy is granted, not as if it were due on the ground of the faults of all being only equal to the fault of those who have uttered rude words, but because the law of Christ claims pardon for those who are penitent, however inhuman and impious their crime may have been. I beg you, esteemed sir, not to propound these paradoxes of the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> as rules of conduct for your son Paradoxus, whom we wish to see grow up in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and in prosperity, to your satisfaction. For what could be worse for himself, yea, what more dangerous for yourself, than that your ingenuous boy should imbibe an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which would make the guilt, I shall not say of parricide, but of insolence to his father, equal only to that of some rude word inconsiderately spoken to a stranger?</p>

<p>16. You are wise, therefore, to insist, when pleading with us for your countrymen on the compassion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, not on the stern doctrines of the Stoical <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which in no wise help, but much rather hinder, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which you have undertaken to support. For a merciful disposition, which we must have if it be possible for us to be moved either by your intercession or by their entreaties, is pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> to be an unworthy weakness, and they expel it utterly from the mind of the wise man, whose perfection, in their opinion, is to be as impassive and inflexible as iron. With more reason, therefore, might it have occurred to you to quote from your own Cicero that sentence in which, praising C&aelig;sar, he says, <q>Of all your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, none is more worthy of admiration, none more graceful, than your clemency.</q>  How much more ought this merciful disposition to prevail in the churches which follow Him who said, <q>I am the way,</q> and which learn from His word, <q>All the ways of the Lord are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a></q>! Fear not, then, that we will try to bring innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to death, when in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we do not even wish the guilty to experience the punishment which they deserve, being moved by that mercy which, joined with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But the man who, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of painfully crossing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the guilty, spares and indulges <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which must thereby gather more strength, is less merciful than the man who, lest he should hear his little boy crying, will not take from him a dangerous knife, and is unmoved by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the wounds or death which he may have to bewail as the consequence of his weakness. Reserve, therefore, until the proper time the work of interceding with us for those men, in loving whom (excuse my saying so) you not only do not go beyond us, but are even hitherto refusing to follow our steps; and write rather in your reply what influences you to shun the way which we follow, and in which we beseech you to go along with us towards that fatherland above, in which we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you take great delight.</p>

<p>17. As to those who are by birth your fellow citizens, you have said indeed that some of them, though not all, were innocent; but, as you must see if you read over again my other letter, you have not made out a defence for them. When, in answer to your remark that you wished to leave your country flourishing, I said that we had felt thorns rather than found flowers in your countrymen, you thought that I wrote in jest. As if, forsooth, in the midst of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of such magnitude we were in a mood for mirth. Certainly not. While the smoke was ascending from the ruins of our church consumed by fire, were we likely to joke on the subject? Although, indeed, none in your city appeared in my opinion innocent, but those who were absent, or were sufferers, or were destitute both of strength and of authority to prevent the tumult, I nevertheless distinguished in my reply those whose guilt was greater from those who were less to blame, and stated that there was a difference between the cases of those who were moved by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of offending powerful enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of those who desired these outrages to be committed; also between those who committed them and those who instigated others to their commission; resolving, however, not to institute inquiry in regard to the instigators, because these, perhaps, could not be ascertained without recourse to the use of tortures, from which we shrink with abhorrence, as utterly inconsistent with our aims. Your friends the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who hold that all faults are alike, must, however, if they were the judges, pronounce them all equally guilty; and if to this opinion they join that inflexible sternness wherewith they disparage clemency as a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, their sentence would necessarily be, not that all should be pardoned alike, but that all should be punished alike. Dismiss, therefore, these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> altogether from the position of advocates in this case, and rather desire that we may act as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, so that, as we desire, we may gain in Christ those whom we forgive, and may not spare them by such indulgence as would be ruinous to themselves. May <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose ways are mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, be pleased to enrich you with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> felicity!</p>
