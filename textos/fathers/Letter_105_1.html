<h1>Letter 105</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a>, the daughters of Count Terentius</em>. </p>

<p>On coming to Samosata I expected to have the pleasure of meeting your excellencies, and when I was disappointed I could not easily bear it. When, I said, will it be possible for me to be in your neighbourhood again? When will it be agreeable to you to come into mine? All this, however, must be left to the Lord's will. As to the present, when I found that my son Sophronius was setting out to you, I gladly delivered him this letter, to convey you my salutation, and to tell you how, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, I do not cease to remember you, and to thank the Lord on your behalf, in that you are goodly scions of a goodly stock, fruitful in good works, and verily like lilies among thorns. Surrounded as you are by the terrible perversity of them that are corrupting the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, you do not give in to their wiles; you have not abandoned the apostolic proclamation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, you have not gone over to the successful novelty of the day. Is not this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of deep thankfulness to God? Shall not this rightly bring you great renown? You have professed your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Do not abandon this deposit; the Father&mdash; origin of all; the Son&mdash; Only begotten, begotten of Him, very <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Perfect of Perfect, living image, showing the whole Father in Himself; the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, having His subsistence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the fount of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, power that gives life, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that makes perfect, through Whom man is adopted, and the mortal made <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, conjoined with Father and Son in all things in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, in power and kingdom, in sovereignty and godhead; as is testified by the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>But all who maintain that either Son or Spirit is a creature, or absolutely reduce the Spirit to ministerial and servile rank, are far removed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Flee their communion. Turn away from their teaching. They are destructive to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. If ever the Lord grant us to meet, I will discourse to you further concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, to the end that you may perceive at once the power of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and the rottenness of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by Scriptural <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>.</p>
