<h1>Letter 105</h1>

<p> <em>(To Pulcheria Augusta about the self-seeking of Anatolius.)</em></p>

<h2>I. He congratulates the Empress on the triumph of the Faith, but regrets the introduction of a new controversy into the Church.</h2>

<p>Leo the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to Pulcheria Augusta.</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> ineffably with your Grace that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith has been defended against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and peace restored to the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through your clemency's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and God-pleasing <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>: giving thanks to the Merciful and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that He has suffered none save those who loved darkness rather than light to be defrauded of the gospel-<a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: so that by the removal of the mists of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> the purest light might arise in the hearts of all, and that darkness-loving foe might not triumph over certain weak <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, whom not only those who stood unhurt but also those whom he had made to totter have overcome, and that by the abolition of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith might reign throughout the world, and <q>every tongue might confess that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father <span class="stiki" id="note360450"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse11">Philippians&nbsp;1:11</a></span> .</q> But when the whole world had been confirmed in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and the hearts of all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> had been guided into the same belief, it had been better that besides those matters for which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod was assembled, and which were brought to a satisfactory agreement through your Grace's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, nothing should be introduced to counteract so great an advantage, and that a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should not be made an occasion for the inopportune advancing of an illegitimate desire.</p>

<h2>II. The Nicene canons are unalterable and binding universally.</h2>

<p>For my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Anatolius not sufficiently considering your Grace's kindness and the favour of my assent, whereby he gained the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of the church of Constantinople, instead of rejoicing at what he has gained, has been inflamed with undue desires beyond the measure of his rank, believing that his intemperate self-seeking could be advanced by the assertion that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> had signified their assent thereto by an extorted signature: notwithstanding that my brethren and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who represented me, faithfully and laudably expressed their dissent from these attempts which are doomed to speedy failure. For no one may venture upon anything in opposition to the enactments of the Father.' canons which many long years ago in the city of Nic&aelig;a were founded upon the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, so that any one who wishes to pass any different decree injures himself rather than impairs them. And if all pontiffs will but keep them inviolate as they should, there will be perfect peace and complete harmony through all the churches: there will be no disagreements about rank, no disputes about ordinations, no controversies about privileges, no strifes about taking that which is another's; but by the fair law of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> a reasonable order will be kept both in conduct and in office, and he will be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> great who is found free from all self-seeking, as the Lord says, <q>Whosoever will become greater among you, let him be your minister, and whosoever will be first among you shall be your slave; even as the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> came not to be ministered unto but to minister <span class="stiki" id="note360451"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;20:26-28</a></span> .</q> And yet these precepts were at the time given to men who wished to rise from a mean estate and to pass from the lowest to the highest things; but what more does the ruler of the church of Constantinople <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> than he has gained? Or what will satisfy him, if the magnificence and renown of so great a city is not enough? It is too arrogant and intemperate thus to step beyond all proper bounds and trampling on ancient custom to wish to seize another's right: to increase one man's dignity at the expense of so many metropolitans' primacy, and to carry a new <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of confusion into peaceful provinces which were long ago set at rest by the enactments of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Nicene Synod: to break through the venerable Father.' decrees by alleging the consent of certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, which even the course of so many years has not rendered effective. For it is boasted that this has been winked at for almost 60 years now, and the said <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> thinks that he is assisted thereby; but it is vain for him to look for assistance from that which, even if a man dared to wish for it, yet he could never obtain.</p>

<h2>III. Only by imitating his predecessor will he regain Leo's confidence: the assent of the bishops is declared null and void.</h2>

<p>Let him realize what a man he has succeeded, and expelling all the spirit of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> let him imitate Flavian's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, Flavian's modesty, Flavian's humility, which has raised him right to a confessor's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. If he will shine with his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, he will merit all praise, and in all quarters he will win an abundance of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not by seeking <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> advancement but by deserving Divine favour. And by this careful course I promise he will bind my heart also to him, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, which we have ever bestowed on the church of Constantinople, shall never be violated by any change. Because if sometimes rulers fall into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> through want of moderation, yet the churches of Christ do not lose their purity. But the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> assents, which are opposed to the regulations of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> canons composed at Nic&aelig;a in conjunction with your faithful Grace, we do not recognize, and by the blessed Apostle Peter's authority we absolutely dis-annul in comprehensive terms, in all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> cases <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> set forth by the 318 <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for the pacific observance of all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in such sort that even if a much greater number were to pass a different decree to theirs, whatever was opposed to their constitution would have to be held in no respect.</p>

<h2>IV. He requests the Empress to give his letter her favourable consideration.</h2>

<p>And so I request your Grace to receive in a worthy spirit this lengthy letter, in which I had to explain my views, at the hands of my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Lucianus, who, as far as in him lies, has faithfully executed the anxious duties of his undertaking as my delegate, and of my son Basil, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. And because it is your habit to labour for the peace and unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> health keep my brother Anatolius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to whom I have extended my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by your advice, within those limits which shall be profitable to him, that as your clemency's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is magnified already for the restoration of the Faith, so it may be published abroad for the restraint of self-seeking. Dated the 22nd of May, in the consulship of the illustrious Herculanus (452).</p>
