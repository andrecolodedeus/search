<h1>Letter 107</h1>

<p><strong>To Laeta</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Laeta, the daughter-in-law of <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, having written from Rome to ask Jerome how she ought to bring up her infant daughter (also called Paula) as a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Jerome now instructs her in detail as to the child's training and education. Feeling some <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, however, as to whether the scheme proposed by him will be practicable at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he advises Laeta in case of difficulty to send Paula to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> where she will be under the care of her grandmother and aunt, the elder <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> and <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>. Laeta subsequently accepted Jerome's advice and sent the child to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> where she eventually succeeded <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> as head of the nunnery founded by her grandmother. The date of the letter is 403 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writing to the Corinthians and instructing in sacred discipline a church still untaught in Christ has among other commandments laid down also this: <q>The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> which has an husband that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband; else were your children unclean but now are they <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q>  Should any person have supposed hitherto that the bonds of discipline are too far relaxed and that too great indulgence is conceded by the teacher, let him look at the house of your father, a man of the highest distinction and learning, but one still walking in darkness; and he will perceive as the result of the apostle's counsel sweet fruit growing from a bitter stock and precious balsams exhaled from common canes. You yourself are the offspring of a mixed marriage; but the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of Paula&mdash; you and my friend Toxotius&mdash; are both <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Who could have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> pontiff Albinus should be born&mdash; in answer to a mother's vows&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> granddaughter; that a delighted grandfather should hear from the little one's faltering lips Christ's <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>, and that in his old age he should nurse in his bosom one of God's own <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>? Our expectations have been fully gratified. The one unbeliever is sanctified by his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and believing <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. For, when a man is surrounded by a believing crowd of children and grandchildren,  he is as good as a candidate for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. I for my part think that, had he possessed so many <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> kinsfolk when he was a young man, he might then have been brought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For though he may spit upon my letter and laugh at it, and though he may call me a fool or a madman, his son-in-law did the same before he came to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are not born but made. For all its gilding the Capitol is beginning to look dingy. Every temple in Rome is covered with soot and cobwebs. The city is stirred to its depths and the people pour past their half-ruined shrines to visit the tombs of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. The belief which has not been accorded to conviction may come to be extorted by very shame.</p>

<p>2. I speak thus to you, Laeta my most devout daughter in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to teach you not to despair of your father's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. My hope is that the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has gained you your daughter may win your father too, and that so you may be able to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over blessings bestowed upon your entire <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Lord's promise: <q>The things which are impossible with men are possible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302664"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;18:27</a></span> It is never too late to mend. The robber passed even from the cross to paradise. <span class="stiki" id="note302665"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;23:42-43</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> also, the king of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, recovered his reason, even after he had been made like the beasts in body and in heart and had been compelled to live with the brutes in the wilderness. <span class="stiki" id="note302666"><a href="../bible/dan004.htm#verse33">Daniel&nbsp;4:33-37</a></span> And to pass over such old stories which to unbelievers may well seem incredible, did not your own kinsman Gracchus whose name betokens his patrician origin, when a few years back he held the prefecture of the City, overthrow, break in pieces, and shake to pieces the grotto of <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a>  and all the dreadful images therein? Those I mean by which the worshippers were initiated as Raven, Bridegroom, Soldier, Lion, Perseus, Sun, Crab, and Father? Did he not, I repeat, destroy these and then, sending them before him as hostages, obtain for himself <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>?</p>

<p>Even in Rome itself paganism is left in solitude. They who once were the gods of the nations remain under their lonely roofs with horned-owls and birds of night. The standards of the military are emblazoned with the sign of the Cross. The emperor's robes of purple and his diadem sparkling with jewels are ornamented with representations of the shameful yet saving gibbet. Already the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Serapis has been made a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>;  while at Gaza Marnas  mourns in confinement and every moment expects to see his temple overturned. From India, from <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, from <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopia</a> we daily welcome <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in crowds. The Armenian bowman has laid aside his quiver, the Huns learn the psalter, the chilly Scythians are warmed with the glow of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The Get&aelig;,  ruddy and yellow-haired, carry tent-churches about with their armies: and perhaps their success in fighting against us may be due to the fact that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the same religion.</p>

<p>3. I have nearly wandered into a new subject, and while I have kept my wheel going, my hands have been moulding a flagon when it has been my object to frame an ewer.  For, in answer to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and those of the saintly Marcella, I wish to address you as a mother and to instruct you how to bring up our dear Paula, who has been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Christ before her birth and vowed to His service before her conception. Thus in our own day we have seen repeated the story told us in the Prophets,  of Hannah, who though at first barren afterwards became fruitful. You have exchanged a fertility bound up with sorrow for offspring which shall never die. For I am confident that having given to the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> you will be the mother of sons. It is the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> that is offered under the Law. <span class="stiki" id="note302673"><a href="../bible/exo013.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;13:2</a></span> Samuel and Samson are both instances of this, as is also John the Baptist who when Mary came in leaped for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.  For he heard the Lord speaking by the mouth of the Virgin and desired to break from his mother's womb to meet Him. As then Paula has been born in answer to a promise, her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> should give her a training suitable to her birth. Samuel, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, was nurtured in the Temple, and John was trained in the wilderness. The first as a Nazarite wore his hair long, drank neither wine nor strong drink, and even in his childhood talked with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The second shunned cities, wore a leathern girdle, and had for his meat locusts and wild honey. <span class="stiki" id="note302675"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;3:4</a></span> Moreover, to typify that penitence which he was to preach, he was clothed in the spoils of the hump-backed camel. </p>

<p>4. Thus must a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> which is to be a temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It must learn to hear nothing and to say nothing but what belongs to the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It must have no understanding  of unclean words, and no <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the world's songs. Its tongue must be steeped while still tender in the sweetness of the psalms. Boys with their wanton thoughts must be kept from Paula: even her maids and female attendants must be separated from worldly associates. For if they have learned some mischief they may teach more. Get for her a set of letters made of boxwood or of ivory and called each by its proper name. Let her play with these, so that even her play may teach her something. And not only make her grasp the right order of the letters and see that she forms their names into a rhyme, but constantly disarrange their order and put the last letters in the middle and the middle ones at the beginning that she may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them all by sight as well as by sound. Moreover, so soon as she begins to use the style upon the wax, and her hand is still faltering, either guide her soft fingers by laying your hand upon hers, or else have simple copies cut upon a tablet; so that her efforts confined within these limits may keep to the lines traced out for her and not stray outside of these. Offer prizes for good spelling and draw her onwards with little gifts such as children of her age delight in. And let her have companions in her lessons to excite emulation in her, that she may be stimulated when she sees them praised. You must not scold her if she is slow to learn but must employ praise to excite her <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so that she may be glad when she excels others and sorry when she is excelled by them. Above all you must take care not to make her lessons distasteful to her lest a dislike for them conceived in childhood may continue into her maturer years. The very words which she tries bit by bit to put together and to pronounce ought not to be chance ones, but names specially fixed upon and heaped together for the purpose, those for example of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or the list of patriarchs from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> downwards as it is given by Matthew and Luke. In this way while her tongue will be well-trained, her memory will be likewise developed. Again, you must choose for her a master of approved years, life, and learning. A man of culture will not, I think, blush to do for a kinswoman or a highborn virgin what Aristotle did for Philip's son when, descending to the level of an usher, he consented to teach him his letters.  Things must not be despised as of small account in the absence of which great results cannot be achieved. The very rudiments and first beginnings of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> sound differently in the mouth of an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> man and of an uneducated. Accordingly you must see that the child is not led away by the silly coaxing of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to form a habit of shortening long words or of decking herself with gold and purple. Of these habits one will spoil her conversation and the other her character. She must not therefore learn as a child what afterwards she will have to unlearn. The eloquence of the Gracchi is said to have been largely due to the way in which from their earliest years their mother spoke to them.  Hortensius  became an orator while still on his father's lap. Early impressions are hard to eradicate from the mind. When once wool has been dyed purple who can restore it to its previous whiteness? An unused jar long retains the taste and smell of that with which it is first filled.  Grecian history tells us that the imperious Alexander who was lord of the whole world could not rid himself of the tricks of manner and gait which in his childhood he had caught from his governor Leonides.  We are always ready to imitate what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and faults are quickly copied where <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> appear inattainable. Paula's nurse must not be intemperate, or loose, or given to gossip. Her bearer must be respectable, and her foster-father of grave demeanour. When she sees her grandfather, she must leap upon his breast, put her arms round his neck, and, whether he likes it or not, sing <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> in his ears. She may be fondled by her grandmother, may smile at her father to show that she recognizes him, and may so endear herself to everyone, as to make the whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the possession of such a rosebud. She should be told at once whom she has for her other grandmother and whom for her aunt; and she ought also to learn in what army it is that she is enrolled as a recruit, and what Captain it is under whose banner she is called to serve. Let her long to be with the absent ones and encourage her to make playful threats of leaving you for them.</p>

<p>5. Let her very dress and garb remind her to Whom she is promised. Do not pierce her ears or paint her face <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Christ with white lead or rouge. Do not hang gold or pearls about her neck or load her head with jewels, or by reddening her hair make it suggest the fires of gehenna. Let her pearls be of another kind and such that she may sell them hereafter and buy in their place the pearl that is <q>of great price.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302682"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;13:46</a></span> In days gone by a lady of rank, Pr&aelig;textata by name, at the bidding of her husband Hymettius, the uncle of <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, altered that virgin's dress and appearance and arranged her neglected hair after the manner of the world, desiring to overcome the resolution of the virgin herself and the expressed wishes of her mother. But lo in the same night it befell her that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> came to her in her dreams. With terrible looks he menaced punishment and broke silence with these words, 'Have you presumed to put your husband's commands before those of Christ? Have you presumed to lay <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> hands upon the head of one who is God's virgin? Those hands shall immediately wither that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by torment what you have done, and at the end of five months you shall be carried off to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>.  And farther, if you persist still in your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, you shall be bereaved both of your husband and of your children.' All of which came to pass in due time, a speedy death marking the penitence too long delayed of the unhappy <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. So terribly does Christ punish those who violate His temple, <span class="stiki" id="note302684"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> and so jealously does He defend His precious jewels. I have related this story here not from any desire to exult over the misfortunes of the unhappy, but to warn you that you must with much <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and carefulness keep the vow which you have made to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>6. We read of Eli the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that he became displeasing to God on account of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his children;  and we are told that a man may not be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> if his sons are loose and disorderly. <span class="stiki" id="note302686"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:4</a></span> On the other hand it is written of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> that <q>she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and charity and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> with <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.</q>  If then <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are responsible for their children when these are of ripe age and independent; how much more must they be responsible for them when, still unweaned and weak, they cannot, in the Lord's words, <q>discern between their right hand and their left:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302688"><a href="../bible/jon004.htm#verse11">Jonah&nbsp;4:11</a></span> &mdash; when, that is to say, they cannot yet distinguish good from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? If you take precautions to save your daughter from the bite of a viper, why are you not equally careful to shield her from <q>the hammer of the whole earth</q>?  to prevent her from drinking of the golden cup of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>? To keep her from going out with Dinah to see the daughters of a strange land? <span class="stiki" id="note302690"><a href="../bible/gen034.htm">Genesis&nbsp;xxxiv</a></span> to save her from the tripping dance and from the trailing robe? No one administers drugs till he has rubbed the rim of the cup with honey;  so, the better to deceive us, <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> puts on the mien and the semblance of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Why then, you will say, do we read:&mdash; <q>the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son,</q> but <q>the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it shall die</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note302692"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse20">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:20</a></span> The passage, I answer, refers to those who have discretion, such as he of whom his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> said in the gospel:&mdash; <q>he is of age...he shall speak for himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302693"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;9:21</a></span> While the son is a child and thinks as a child and until he comes to years of discretion to choose between the two roads to which the letter of Pythagoras points,  his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are responsible for his actions whether these be good or bad. But perhaps you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that, if they are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the children of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are liable for their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and that no guilt attaches to <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who withhold from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> those who by reason of their tender age can offer no objection to it. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ensures the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the child, this in turn brings advantage to the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Whether you would offer your child or not lay within your choice, but now that you have offered her, you neglect her at your peril. I speak generally for in your case you have no discretion, having offered your child even before her conception. He who offers a victim that is lame or maimed or marked with any blemish is held guilty of sacrilege. <span class="stiki" id="note302695"><a href="../bible/deu015.htm#verse21">Deuteronomy&nbsp;15:21</a></span> How much more then shall she be punished who makes ready for the embraces of the king a portion of her own body and the purity of a stainless <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and then proves negligent of this her offering?</p>

<p>7. When Paula comes to be a little older and to increase like her Spouse in wisdom and stature and in favour with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302696"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse52">Luke&nbsp;2:52</a></span> let her go with her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> to the temple of her <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Father but let her not come out of the temple with them. Let them seek her upon the world's highway amid the crowds and the throng of their kinsfolk, and let them find her nowhere but in the shrine of the scriptures, <span class="stiki" id="note302697"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;2:43-46</a></span> questioning the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> on the meaning of that spiritual marriage to which she is vowed. Let her imitate the retirement of Mary whom Gabriel found alone in her chamber and who was frightened, <span class="stiki" id="note302698"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;1:29</a></span> it would appear, by seeing a man there. Let the child emulate her of whom it is written that <q>the king's daughter is all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> within.</q>  Wounded with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love's</a> arrow let her say to her beloved, <q>the king has brought me into his chambers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302700"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse4">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:4</a></span> At no time let her go abroad, lest the watchmen find her that go about the city, and lest they smite and wound her and take away from her the veil of her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302701"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse7">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:7</a></span> and leave her naked in her blood. <span class="stiki" id="note302702"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse1">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:1-10</a></span> Nay rather when one knocks at her door <span class="stiki" id="note302703"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:2</a></span> let her say: <q>I am a wall and my breasts like towers. <span class="stiki" id="note302704"><a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse10">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;8:10</a></span> I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302705"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse3">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:3</a></span> </p>

<p>8. Let her not take her food with others, that is, at her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> table; lest she see dishes she may long for. Some, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, hold it a greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to disdain a pleasure which is actually before them, but I think it a safer self-restraint to shun what must needs attract you. Once as a boy at school I met the words: 'It is ill blaming what you allow to become a habit.'  Let her learn even now not to drink wine <q>wherein is excess.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302707"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse18">Ephesians&nbsp;5:18</a></span> But as, before children come to a robust age, abstinence is dangerous and trying to their tender frames, let her have baths if she require them, and let her take a little wine for her stomach's sake. <span class="stiki" id="note302708"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:23</a></span> Let her also be supported on a flesh diet, lest her feet fail her before they commence to run their course. But I say this by way of concession not by way of command; because I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to weaken her, not because I wish to teach her self-indulgence. Besides why should not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgin do wholly what others do in part? The superstitious <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> reject certain animals and products as articles of food, while among the Indians the Brahmans and among the Egyptians the Gymnosophists subsist altogether on porridge, rice, and apples. If mere glass repays so much labour, must not a pearl be worth more labour still?  Paula has been born in response to a vow. Let her life be as the lives of those who were born under the same conditions. If the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> accorded is in both cases the same, the pains bestowed ought to be so too. Let her be deaf to the sound of the organ, and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even the uses of the pipe, the lyre, and the cithern.</p>

<p>9. And let it be her task daily to bring to you the flowers which she has culled from scripture. Let her learn by heart so many verses in the Greek, but let her be instructed in the Latin also. For, if the tender lips are not from the first shaped to this, the tongue is spoiled by a foreign accent and its native speech debased by alien elements. You must yourself be her mistress, a model on which she may form her childish conduct. Never either in you nor in her father let her see what she cannot imitate without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Remember both of you that you are the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgin, and that your example will teach her more than your precepts. Flowers are quick to fade and a baleful wind soon withers the violet, the lily, and the crocus. Let her never appear in public unless accompanied by you. Let her never visit a church or a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> shrine unless with her mother. Let no young man greet her with smiles; no dandy with curled hair pay compliments to her. If our little virgin goes to keep solemn eves and all-night <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, let her not stir a hair's breadth from her mother's side. She must not single out one of her maids to make her a special favourite or a confidante. What she says to one all ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. Let her choose for a companion not a handsome well-dressed girl, able to warble a song with liquid notes but one pale and serious, sombrely attired and with the hue of melancholy. Let her take as her model some aged virgin of approved <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, character, and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, apt to instruct her by word and by example. She ought to rise at night to recite <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and psalms; to sing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> in the morning; at the third, sixth, and ninth hours to take her place in the line to do battle for Christ; and, lastly, to kindle her lamp and to offer her evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>.  In these occupations let her pass the day, and when night comes let it find her still engaged in them. Let reading follow <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with her, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> again succeed to reading. Time will seem short when employed on tasks so many and so varied.</p>

<p>10. Let her learn too how to spin wool, to hold the distaff, to put the basket in her lap, to turn the spinning wheel and to shape the yarn with her thumb. Let her put away with disdain silken fabrics, <a href="../cathen/03663b.htm">Chinese</a> fleeces,  and gold brocades: the clothing which she makes for herself should keep out the cold and not expose the body which it professes to cover. Let her food be herbs and wheaten bread  with now and then one or two small fishes. And that I may not waste more time in giving precepts for the regulation of appetite (a subject I have treated more at length elsewhere)  let her meals always leave her hungry and able on the moment to begin reading or chanting. I strongly disapprove&mdash; especially for those of tender years&mdash; of long and immoderate <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> in which week is added to week and even oil and apples are forbidden as food. I have learned by experience that the ass toiling along the high way makes for an inn when it is weary.  Our abstinence may turn to glutting, like that of the worshippers of Isis and of Cybele who gobble up pheasants and turtle-doves piping hot that their teeth may not violate the gifts of Ceres.  If perpetual <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is allowed, it must be so regulated that those who have a long journey before them may hold out all through; and we must take care that we do not, after starting well, fall halfway. However in Lent, as I have written before now, those who practise self-denial should spread every stitch of canvas, and the charioteer should for once slacken the reins and increase the speed of his horses. Yet there will be one rule for those who live in the world and another for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> in Lent consumes the coats of his stomach, and living like a snail on his own juices makes ready a paunch for rich foods and feasting to come. But with the virgin and the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> the case is different; for, when these give the rein to their steeds, they have to remember that for them the race <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of no intermission. An effort made only for a limited time may well be severe, but one that has no such limit must be more moderate. For whereas in the first case we can recover our breath when the race is over, in the last we have to go on continually and without stopping.</p>

<p>11. When you go a short way into the country, do not leave your daughter behind you. Leave her no power or capacity of living without you, and let her feel frightened when she is left to herself. Let her not converse with people of the world or associate with <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> indifferent to their vows. Let her not be present at the weddings of your slaves and let her take no part in the noisy games of the household. As regards the use of the bath, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that some are content with saying that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> virgin should not bathe along with eunuchs or with married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, with the former because they are still men, at all events in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and with the latter because <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with child offer a revolting spectacle. For myself, however, I wholly disapprove of baths for a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of full age. Such an one should blush and feel overcome at the idea of seeing herself undressed. By <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> she mortifies her body and brings it into subjection. By a cold <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> she seeks to put out the flame of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and to quench the hot desires of youth. And by a deliberate squalor she makes haste to spoil her natural good looks. Why, then, should she add fuel to a sleeping fire by taking baths?</p>

<p>12. Let her treasures be not silks or gems but manuscripts of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures; and in these let her think less of gilding, and Babylonian parchment, and arabesque patterns,  than of correctness and accurate punctuation. Let her begin by learning the psalter, and then let her gather rules of life out of the proverbs of Solomon. From the Preacher let her gain the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of despising the world and its vanities.  Let her follow the example set in Job of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and of patience. Then let her pass on to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> never to be laid aside when once they have been taken in hand. Let her also drink in with a willing heart the Acts of the Apostles and the Epistles. As soon as she has enriched the storehouse of her mind with these treasures, let her commit to memory the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the heptateuch,  the books of Kings and of Chronicles, the rolls also of Ezra and Esther. When she has done all these she may safely read the Song of Songs but not before: for, were she to read it at the beginning, she would fail to perceive that, though it is written in fleshly words, it is a marriage song of a spiritual bridal. And not understanding this she would suffer hurt from it. Let her avoid all <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal writings</a>, and if she is led to read such not by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the doctrines which they contain but out of respect for the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> contained in them; let her understand that they are not really written by those to whom they are ascribed, that many faulty elements have been introduced into them, and that it requires <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> discretion to look for gold in the midst of dirt. Cyprian's writings let her have always in her hands. The letters of Athanasius  and the treatises of Hilary  she may go through without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of stumbling. Let her take pleasure in the works and wits of all in whose books a due regard for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is not neglected. But if she reads the works of others let it be rather to judge them than to follow them.</p>

<p>13. You will answer, 'How shall I, a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of the world, living at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, surrounded by a crowd, be able to observe all these injunctions?' In that case do not undertake a burden to which you are not equal. When you have weaned Paula as Isaac was weaned and when you have clothed her as Samuel was clothed, send her to her <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">grandmother</a> and <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">aunt</a>; give up this most precious of gems, to be placed in Mary's chamber and to rest in the cradle where the infant Jesus cried. Let her be brought up in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, let her be one amid companies of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, let her learn to avoid swearing, let her regard lying as sacrilege, let her be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the world, let her live the angelic life, while in the flesh let her be without the flesh, and let her suppose that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings are like herself. To say nothing of its other advantages this course will free you from the difficult task of minding her, and from the responsibility of guardianship. It is better to regret her absence than to be for ever trembling for her. For you cannot but tremble as you watch what she says and to whom she says it, to whom she bows and whom she likes best to see. Hand her over to <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> while she is still but an infant and her every cry is a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for you. She will thus become her companion in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> now as well as her successor hereafter. Let her gaze upon and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, let her <q>from her earliest years admire</q>  one whose language and gait and dress are an education in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302722"><a href="../bible/sir010.htm#verse30">Sirach&nbsp;19:30</a></span> Let her sit in the lap of her grandmother, and let this latter repeat to her granddaughter the lessons that she once bestowed upon her own child. Long experience has shown <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> how to rear, to preserve, and to instruct <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; and daily inwoven in her crown is the mystic century which betokens the highest <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>.  O <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> virgin! <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> Paula, daughter of Toxotius, who through the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of her grandmother and aunt is nobler in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> than she is in lineage! Yes, Laeta: were it possible for you with your own eyes to see your mother-in-law and your sister, and to realize the mighty <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which animate their small bodies; such is your innate thirst for <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> that I cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that you would go to them even before your daughter, and would emancipate yourself from God's first decree of the Law <span class="stiki" id="note302724"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> to put yourself under His second dispensation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302725"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:1</a></span> You would count as nothing your desire for other offspring and would offer up yourself to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But because <q>there is a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302726"><a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;3:5</a></span> and because <q>the wife has not power of her own body,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302727"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:4</a></span> and because the apostle says <q>Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302728"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:20</a></span> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and because he that is under the yoke ought so to run as not to leave his companion in the mire, I counsel you to pay back to the full in your offspring what meantime you defer paying in your own person. When Hannah had once offered in the tabernacle the son whom she had vowed to God she never took him back; for she thought it unbecoming that one who was to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> should grow up in the same house with her who still desired to have other children. Accordingly after she had conceived him and given him birth, she did not venture to come to the temple alone or to appear before the Lord empty, but first paid to Him what she owed; and then, when she had offered up that great <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, she returned home and because she had borne her <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, she was given five children for herself. <span class="stiki" id="note302729"><a href="../bible/1sa002.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;2:21</a></span> Do you marvel at the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? Imitate her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Moreover, if you will only send Paula, I promise to be myself both a tutor and a foster father to her. Old as I am I will carry her on my shoulders and train her stammering lips; and my charge will be a far grander one than that of the worldly <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>;  for while he only taught a King of Macedon who was one day to die of Babylonian poison, I shall instruct the handmaid and spouse of Christ who must one day be offered to her Lord in heaven.</p>
