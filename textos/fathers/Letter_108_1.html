<h1>Letter 108</h1>

<p><strong>To Eustochium</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This, one of the longest of Jerome's letters, was written to console <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> for the loss of her mother who had recently died. Jerome relates the story of <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> in detail; speaking first of her high birth, marriage, and social success at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and then narrating her conversion and subsequent life as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a>. Much space is devoted to an account of her journey to the East which included a visit to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and to the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Nitria as well as a tour of the most sacred spots in the Holy Land. The remainder of the letter describes her daily routine and studies at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and recounts the many <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> for which she was distinguished. It then concludes with a touching description of her death and burial and gives the epitaph placed upon her grave. The date of the letter is 404 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. If all the members of my body were to be converted into tongues, and if each of my limbs were to be gifted with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice, I could still do no <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>. Noble in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, she was nobler still in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; rich formerly in this world's goods, she is now more distinguished by the poverty that she has embraced for Christ. Of the stock of the Gracchi and descended from the Scipios, the heir and representative of that Paulus whose name she bore, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and legitimate daughter of that Martia Papyria who was mother to <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a>, she yet preferred <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and left her palace glittering with gold to dwell in a mud cabin. We do not grieve that we have lost this perfect <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; rather we thank God that we have had her, nay that we have her still. For <q>all live unto</q> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302731"><a href="../bible/luk020.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;20:38</a></span> and they who return unto the Lord are still to be reckoned members of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>. We have lost her, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but the heavenly mansions have gained her; for as long as she was in the body she was absent from the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note302732"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> and would constantly complain with tears:&mdash; <q>Woe is me that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar; my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has been this long time a pilgrim.</q>  It was no wonder that she sobbed out that even she was in darkness (for this is the meaning of the word Kedar) seeing that, according to the apostle, <q>the world lies in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302734"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> and that, <q>as its darkness is, so is its light;</q>  and that <q>the light shines in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302736"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;1:5</a></span> She would frequently exclaim: <q>I am a stranger with you and a sojourner as all my fathers were,</q>  and again, I desire <q>to depart and to be with Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302738"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> As often too as she was troubled with bodily weakness (brought on by incredible abstinence and by redoubled <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>), she would be heard to say: <q>I keep under my body and bring it into subjection; lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302739"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:27</a></span> and <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302740"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;14:21</a></span> and <q>I humbled my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>;</q>  and <q>you will make all</q> my <q>bed in</q> my <q>sickness;</q>  and <q>Your hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer.</q>  And when the pain which she bore with such wonderful patience darted through her, as if she saw the heavens opened <span class="stiki" id="note302744"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse56">Acts&nbsp;7:56</a></span> she would say <q>Oh that I had wings like a dove! For then would I fly away and be at rest.</q> </p>

<p>2. I call Jesus and his <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, yes and the particular <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who was the guardian and the companion of this admirable <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that these are no words of adulation and flattery but <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> testimony every one of them borne to her character. They are, indeed, inadequate to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of one whose praises are sung by the whole world, who is admired by <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>,  regretted by bands of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and wept for by crowds of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and poor. Would you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, reader, in short? She has left those dependent on her poor, but not so poor as she was herself. In dealing thus with her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> and the men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of her small household&mdash; her brothers and sisters rather than her servants&mdash; she has done nothing strange; for she has left her daughter <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Christ for whose comfort this sketch is made&mdash; far from her noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and rich only in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<p>3. Let me then begin my narrative. Others may go back a long way even to <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula's</a> cradle and, if I may say so, to her swaddling-clothes, and may speak of her mother Bl&aelig;silla and her father Rogatus. Of these the former was a descendant of the Scipios and the Gracchi; while the latter came of a line distinguished in Greece down to the present day. He was said, indeed, to have in his veins the blood of Agamemnon who destroyed Troy after a ten years siege. But I shall praise only what belongs to herself, what wells forth from the pure spring of her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mind. When in the gospel the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> ask their Lord and Saviour what He will give to those who have left all for His sake, He tells them that they shall receive an hundredfold now in this time and in the world to come <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. <span class="stiki" id="note302747"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse28">Mark&nbsp;10:28-30</a></span> From which we see that it is not the possession of riches that is praiseworthy but the rejection of them for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake; that, instead of glorying in our privileges, we should make them of small account as compared with God's <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Truly the Saviour has now in this present time made good His promise to His servants and handmaidens. For one who despised the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a single city is today famous throughout the world; and one who while she lived at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by no one outside it has by hiding herself at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> become the admiration of all lands Roman and barbarian. For what race of men is there which does not send pilgrims to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places? And who could there find a greater marvel than <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>? As among many jewels the most precious shines most brightly, and as the sun with its beams obscures and puts out the paler fires of the stars; so by her lowliness she surpassed all others in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and influence and, while she was least among all, was greater than all. The more she cast herself down, the more she was lifted up by Christ. She was hidden and yet she was not hidden. By shunning <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> she earned <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; for <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> follows <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> as its shadow; and deserting those who seek it, it seeks those who despise it. But I must not neglect to proceed with my narrative or dwell too long on a single point forgetful of the rules of writing.</p>

<p>4. Being then of such parentage, <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> married Toxotius in whose veins ran the noble blood of &AElig;neas and the Julii. Accordingly his daughter, Christ's virgin <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, is called Julia, as he Julius.</p>

<blockquote><p>A name from great Iulus handed down. </p></blockquote>

<p>I speak of these things not as of importance to those who have them, but as worthy of remark in those who despise them. Men of the world look up to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are rich in such privileges. We on the other hand praise those who for the Saviour's sake despise them; and strangely depreciating all who keep them, we eulogize those who are unwilling to do so. Thus nobly born, <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> through her fruitfulness and her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> won approval from all, from her husband first, then from her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, and lastly from the whole city. She bore five children; Bl&aelig;silla, for whose death I consoled her while at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>;  Paulina, who has left the reverend and admirable Pammachius to inherit both her vows  and property, to whom also I addressed a little book on her death; <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, who is now in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, a precious necklace of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and of the church; Rufina, whose untimely end overcame the affectionate heart of her mother; and Toxotius, after whom she had no more children. You can thus see that it was not her wish to fulfil a wife's duty, but that she only complied with her husband's longing to have male offspring.</p>

<p>5. When he died, her grief was so great that she nearly died herself: yet so completely did she then give herself to the service of the Lord, that it might have seemed that she had desired his death.</p>

<p>In what terms shall I speak of her distinguished, and noble, and formerly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> house; all the riches of which she spent upon the poor? How can I describe the great consideration she showed to all and her far reaching kindness even to those whom she had never seen? What poor man, as he lay dying, was not wrapped in blankets given by her? What bedridden person was not supported with money from her purse? She would seek out such with the greatest diligence throughout the city, and would think it a misfortune were any hungry or sick person to be supported by another's food. So lavish was her charity that she <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> her children; and, when her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> remonstrated with her for doing so, she declared that she was leaving to them a better inheritance in the mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>6. Nor was she long able to endure the visits and crowded receptions, which her high position in the world and her exalted <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> entailed upon her. She received the homage paid to her sadly, and made all the speed she could to shun and to escape those who wished to pay her compliments. It so happened that at that time  the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the East and West had been summoned to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> by letter from the emperors  to deal with certain dissensions between the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and in this way she saw two most admirable men and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> prelates, Paulinus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and Epiphanius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Salamis or, as it is now called, Constantia, in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. Epiphanius, indeed, she received as her guest; and, although Paulinus was staying in another person's house, in the warmth of her heart she treated him as if he too were lodged with her. Inflamed by their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> she thought more and more each moment of forsaking her home. Disregarding her house, her children, her servants, her property, and in a word everything connected with the world, she was eager&mdash; alone and unaccompanied (if ever it could be said that she was so)&mdash; to go to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> made famous by its Pauls and by its Antonies. And at last when the winter was over and the sea was open, and when the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were returning to their churches, she also sailed with them in her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and desires. Not to prolong the story, she went down to Portus accompanied by her brother, her kinsfolk and above all her own children eager by their demonstrations of affection to overcome their loving mother. At last the sails were set and the strokes of the rowers carried the vessel into the deep. On the shore the little Toxotius stretched forth his hands in entreaty, while Rufina, now grown up, with silent sobs besought her mother to wait till she should be married. But still <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula's</a> eyes were dry as she turned them heavenwards; and she overcame her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for her children by her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for God. She <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> herself no more as a mother, that she might approve herself a handmaid of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Yet her heart was rent within her, and she wrestled with her grief, as though she were being forcibly separated from parts of herself. The greatness of the affection she had to overcome made all admire her victory the more. Among the cruel hardships which attend prisoners of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in the hands of their enemies, there is none severer than the separation of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> from their children. Though it is against the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature, she endured this trial with unabated <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; nay more she sought it with a joyful heart: and overcoming her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for her children by her greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, she concentrated herself quietly upon <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> alone, the partner alike of her vows and of her voyage. Meantime the vessel ploughed onwards and all her fellow-passengers looked back to the shore. But she turned away her eyes that she might not see what she could not behold without agony. No mother, it must be confessed, ever loved her children so dearly. Before setting out she gave them all that she had, disinheriting herself upon earth that she might find an inheritance in heaven.</p>

<p>7. The vessel touched at the island of Pontia ennobled long since as the place of exile of the illustrious lady Flavia Domitilla who under the Emperor <a href="../cathen/05114b.htm">Domitian</a> was banished because she confessed herself a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>;  and <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, when she saw the cells in which this lady passed the period of her long <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, taking to herself the wings of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, more than ever desired to see Jerusalem and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places. The strongest winds seemed weak and the greatest speed slow. After passing between Scylla and Charybdis  she committed herself to the Adriatic sea and had a calm passage to Methone.  Stopping here for a short time to recruit her wearied frame</p>

<blockquote><p>She stretched her dripping limbs upon the shore:
<br>Then sailed past Malea and Cythera's isle,
<br>The scattered Cyclades, and all the lands
<br>That narrow in the seas on every side. </p></blockquote>

<p>Then leaving Rhodes and Lycia behind her, she at last came in sight of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, where falling at the feet of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable Epiphanius, she was by him detained ten days; though this was not, as he supposed, to restore her strength but, as the facts prove, that she might do God's work. For she visited all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the island, and left, so far as her means allowed, substantial relief for the brothers in them whom <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man had brought there from all parts of the world. Then crossing the narrow sea she landed at Seleucia, and going up thence to <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> allowed herself to be detained for a little time by the affection of the reverend confessor Paulinus.  Then, such was the ardour of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that she, a noble lady who had always previously been carried by eunuchs, went her way&mdash; and that in midwinter&mdash; riding upon an ass.</p>

<p>8. I say nothing of her journey through C&oelig;le-<a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a> (for it is not my purpose to give you a complete itinerary of her wanderings); I shall only name such places as are mentioned in the sacred books. After leaving the Roman colony of Berytus and the ancient city of Zidon she entered Elijah's town on the shore at Zarephath and therein adored her Lord and Saviour. Next passing over the sands of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> on which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had once knelt <span class="stiki" id="note302758"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;21:5</a></span> she came to Acco or, as it is now called, Ptolemais, rode over the plains of Megiddo which had once witnessed the slaying of Josiah, <span class="stiki" id="note302759"><a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;23:29</a></span> and entered the land of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>. Here she could not fail to admire the ruins of Dor, once a most powerful city; and Strato's Tower, which though at one time insignificant was rebuilt by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> king of Jud&aelig;a and named C&aelig;sarea in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of C&aelig;sar Augustus.  Here she saw the house of Cornelius now turned into a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church; and the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> abode of Philip; and the chambers of his daughters the four <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> <q>which did prophesy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302761"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;21:8-9</a></span> She arrived next at Antipatris, a small town half in ruins, named by <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> after his father Antipater, and at Lydda, now become Diospolis, a place made famous by the raising again of Dorcas <span class="stiki" id="note302762"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse36">Acts&nbsp;9:36-41</a></span> and the restoration to health of &AElig;neas. <span class="stiki" id="note302763"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;9:32-34</a></span> Not far from this are Arimath&aelig;a, the village of Joseph who buried the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note302764"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;19:38</a></span> and Nob, once a city of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> but now the tomb in which their slain bodies rest.

Again resuming her journey, she came to Nicopolis, once called Emmaus, where the Lord became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the breaking of bread;  an action by which He dedicated the house of Cleopas as a church. Starting thence she made her way up lower and higher Beth-horon, cities founded by Solomon <span class="stiki" id="note302769"><a href="../bible/2ch008.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;8:5</a></span> but subsequently destroyed by several devastating <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>; seeing on her right Ajalon and Gibeon where Joshua the son of Nun when fighting against the five kings gave commandments to the sun and moon, <span class="stiki" id="note302770"><a href="../bible/jos010.htm#verse12">Joshua&nbsp;10:12-14</a></span> where also he condemned the Gibeonites (who by a crafty stratagem had obtained a treaty) to be hewers of wood and drawers of water. <span class="stiki" id="note302771"><a href="../bible/jos009.htm">Joshua&nbsp;ix</a></span> At Gibeah also, now a complete ruin, she stopped for a little while remembering its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the cutting of the concubine into pieces, and how in spite of all this three hundred men of the tribe of Benjamin were saved  that in after days <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> might be called a Benjamite.</p>

<p>9. To make a long story short, leaving on her left the mausoleum of Helena queen of Adiabene  who in time of famine had sent grain to the Jewish people, <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> entered Jerusalem, Jebus, or Salem, that city of three names which after it had sunk to ashes and decay was by <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">&AElig;lius Hadrianus</a> restored once more as <a href="../cathen/08355a.htm">&AElig;lia</a>.  And although the proconsul of Palestine, who was an intimate friend of her house, sent forward his apparitors and gave orders to have his official residence  placed at her disposal, she chose a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> cell in preference to it. Moreover, in visiting the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places so great was the passion and the enthusiasm she exhibited for each, that she could never have torn herself away from one had she not been eager to visit the rest. Before the Cross she threw herself down in adoration as though she beheld the Lord hanging upon it: and when she entered the tomb which was the scene of the Resurrection she kissed the stone which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had rolled away from the door of the sepulchre. <span class="stiki" id="note302776"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;28:2</a></span> Indeed so ardent was her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that she even licked with her mouth the very spot on which the Lord's body had lain, like one thirsty for the river which he has longed for. What tears she shed there, what groans she uttered, and what grief she poured forth, all Jerusalem <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>; the Lord also to whom she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. Going out thence she made the ascent of Zion; a name which signifies either <q>citadel</q> or <q>watchtower.</q> This formed the city which David formerly stormed and afterwards rebuilt. <span class="stiki" id="note302777"><a href="../bible/2sa005.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;5:7,&nbsp;9</a></span> Of its storming it is written, <q>Woe to Ariel, to Ariel</q>&mdash; that is, God's lion, (and indeed in those days it was extremely strong)&mdash; <q>the city which David stormed:</q>  and of its rebuilding it is said, <q>His foundation is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountains: the Lord loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</q>  He does not mean the gates which we see today in dust and ashes; the gates he means are those against which <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> prevails not <span class="stiki" id="note302780"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> and through which the multitude of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ enter in. <span class="stiki" id="note302781"><a href="../bible/rev022.htm#verse14">Revelation&nbsp;22:14</a></span> There was shown to her upholding the portico of a church the bloodstained column to which our Lord is said to have been bound when He suffered His scourging. There was shown to her also the spot where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came down upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the one hundred and twenty <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, thus fulfilling the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Joel. <span class="stiki" id="note302782"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse16">Acts&nbsp;2:16-21</a></span> </p>

<p>10. Then, after distributing money to the poor and her fellow-servants so far as her means allowed, she proceeded to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> stopping only on the right side of the road to visit Rachel's tomb. (Here it was that she gave birth to her son destined to be not what his dying mother called him, Benoni, that is the <q>Son of my pangs</q> but as his father in the spirit <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> named him Benjamin, that is <q>the Son of the right hand).</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302783"><a href="../bible/gen035.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;35:18-19</a></span> After this she came to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> and entered into the cave where the Saviour was born.  Here, when she looked upon the inn made sacred by the virgin and the stall where the ox <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his owner and the ass his master's crib, <span class="stiki" id="note302785"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;1:3</a></span> and where the words of the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> had been fulfilled <q>Blessed is he that sows beside the waters where the ox and the ass trample the seed under their feet:</q>  when she looked upon these things I say, she protested in my hearing that she could behold with the eyes of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the infant Lord wrapped in swaddling clothes and crying in the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>, the wise men worshipping Him, the star shining overhead, the virgin mother, the attentive foster-father, the shepherds coming by night to see <q>the word that had come to pass</q>  and thus even then to consecrate those opening phrases of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John <q>In the beginning was the word</q> and <q>the word was made flesh.</q>  She declared that she could see the slaughtered innocents, the raging <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> fleeing into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and with a mixture of tears and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> she cried: 'Hail <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, house of bread,  wherein was born that Bread that came down from heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note302790"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span> Hail Ephratah, land of fruitfulness  and of fertility, whose fruit is the Lord Himself.

Therefore he says boldly: <q>We will go into His tabernacle: we will worship at His footstool.</q>  I too, miserable sinner though I am, have been accounted worthy to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> the manger in which the Lord cried as a babe, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the cave in which the travailing virgin gave birth to the infant Lord. <q>This is my rest</q> for it is my Lord's native place; <q>here will I dwell</q>  for this spot has my Saviour chosen. <q>I have prepared a lamp for my Christ.</q>  <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall live unto Him and my seed shall serve Him.</q> </p>

<p>After this <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> went a short distance down the hill to the tower of Edar,  that is 'of the flock,' near which Jacob fed his flocks, and where the shepherds keeping watch by night were privileged to hear the words: <q>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest and on earth peace, goodwill toward men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302809"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;2:14</a></span> While they were keeping their sheep they found the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whose fleece bright and clean was made wet with the dew of heaven when it was dry upon all the earth beside,  and whose blood when sprinkled on the doorposts drove off the destroyer of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> <span class="stiki" id="note302811"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse21">Exodus&nbsp;12:21-23</a></span> and took away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world. <span class="stiki" id="note302812"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> </p>

<p>11. Then immediately quickening her pace she began to move along the old road which leads to Gaza, that is to the 'power' or '<a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>' of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, silently meditating on that type of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> eunuch, who in spite of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> changed his skin <span class="stiki" id="note302813"><a href="../bible/jer013.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;13:23</a></span> and while he read the old testament found the fountain of the gospel. <span class="stiki" id="note302814"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse27">Acts&nbsp;8:27-39</a></span> Next turning to the right she passed from Bethzur  to Eshcol which means <q>a cluster of grapes.</q> It was hence that the spies brought back that marvellous cluster which was the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the fertility of the land <span class="stiki" id="note302816"><a href="../bible/num013.htm#verse23">Numbers&nbsp;13:23-24</a></span> and a type of Him who says of Himself: <q>I have trodden the wine press alone; and of the people there was none with me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302817"><a href="../bible/isa063.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;63:3</a></span> Shortly afterwards she entered the home  of Sarah and beheld the birthplace of Isaac and the traces of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> oak under which he saw Christ's day and was glad.  And rising up from thence she went up to Hebron, that is Kirjath-Arba, or the City of the Four Men. These are <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, Jacob, and the great <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> whom the Hebrews suppose (from the book of Joshua the son of Nun) to be buried there.  But many are of opinion that Caleb is the fourth and a monument at one side is pointed out as his. After seeing these places she did not care to go on to Kirjath-sepher, that is <q>the village of letters;</q> because despising the letter that kills she had found the spirit that gives life. <span class="stiki" id="note302821"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:6</a></span> She admired more the upper springs and the nether springs which Othniel the son of Kenaz the son of Jephunneh received in place of a south land and a waterless possession,  and by the conducting of which he watered the dry fields of the old covenant. For thus did he typify the redemption which the sinner finds for his old <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. On the next day soon after sunrise she stood upon the brow of Capharbarucha,  that is, <q>the house of blessing,</q> the point to which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> pursued the Lord when he made intercession with Him. <span class="stiki" id="note302824"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;18:23-33</a></span> And here, as she looked down upon the wide solitude and upon the country once belonging to <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>, to Admah and Zeboim, she beheld the balsam vines of Engedi and Zoar. By Zoar I mean that <q>heifer of three years old</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302825"><a href="../bible/isa015.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;15:5</a></span> which was formerly called Bela <span class="stiki" id="note302826"><a href="../bible/gen014.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;14:2</a></span> and in Syriac is rendered Zoar that is 'little.' She called to mind the cave in which <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> found refuge, and with tears in her eyes warned the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> her companions to beware of <q>wine wherein is excess;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302827"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse18">Ephesians&nbsp;5:18</a></span> for it was to this that the Moabites and Ammonites owe their origin. <span class="stiki" id="note302828"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;19:30-38</a></span> </p>

<p>12. I linger long in the land of the midday sun for it was there and then that the spouse found her bridegroom at rest <span class="stiki" id="note302829"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse7">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:7</a></span> and Joseph drank wine with his brothers once more. <span class="stiki" id="note302830"><a href="../bible/gen043.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;43:16</a></span> I will return to Jerusalem and, passing through Tekoa the home of Amos, <span class="stiki" id="note302831"><a href="../bible/amo001.htm#verse1">Amos&nbsp;1:1</a></span> I will look upon the glistening cross of <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount Olivet</a> from which the Saviour made His ascension to the Father.  Here year by year a red heifer was burned as a holocaust to the Lord and its ashes were used to purify the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302833"><a href="../bible/num019.htm#verse1">Numbers&nbsp;19:1-10</a></span> Here also according to Ezekiel the Cherubim after leaving the temple founded the church of the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note302834"><a href="../bible/eze010.htm#verse18">Ezekiel&nbsp;10:18-19</a></span> </p>

<p>After this <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> visited the tomb of Lazarus and beheld the hospitable roof of Mary and Martha, as well as Bethphage, 'the town of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> jaws.'  Here it was that a restive foal typical of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> received the bridle of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and covered with the garments of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <span class="stiki" id="note302836"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;21:1-7</a></span> offered its lowly back  for Him to sit on. From this she went straight on down the hill to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> thinking of the wounded man in the gospel, of the savagery of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> who passed him by, and of the kindness of the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, that is, the guardian, who placed the half-dead man upon his own beast and brought him down to the inn of the church. <span class="stiki" id="note302838"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;10:30-35</a></span> She noticed the place called Adomim  or the Place of Blood, so-called because much blood was shed there in the frequent incursions of marauders. She beheld also the sycamore tree <span class="stiki" id="note302840"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;19:4</a></span> of Zacch&aelig;us, by which is signified the good works of repentance whereby he trod under foot his former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of bloodshed and rapine, and from which he saw the Most High as from a pinnacle of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. She was shown too the spot by the wayside where the blind men sat who, receiving their sight from the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note302841"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;20:30-34</a></span> became types of the two peoples  who should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> upon Him. Then entering <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> she saw the city which Hiel founded in Abiram his <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> and of which he set up the gates in his youngest son Segub. <span class="stiki" id="note302843"><a href="../bible/1ki016.htm#verse34">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;16:34</a></span> She looked upon the camp of Gilgal and the hill of the foreskins <span class="stiki" id="note302844"><a href="../bible/jos005.htm#verse3">Joshua&nbsp;5:3</a></span> suggestive of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the second <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>: <span class="stiki" id="note302845"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;2:28-29</a></span> and she gazed at the twelve stones brought there out of the bed of Jordan  to be <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a> of those twelve foundations on which are written the names of the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302847"><a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse14">Revelation&nbsp;21:14</a></span> She saw also that fountain of the Law most bitter and barren which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Elisha healed by his wisdom changing it into a well sweet and fertilising.  Scarcely had the night passed away when burning with eagerness she hastened to the Jordan, stood by the brink of the river, and as the sun rose recalled to mind the rising of the sun of righteousness; <span class="stiki" id="note302849"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse2">Malachi&nbsp;4:2</a></span> how the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> feet stood firm in the middle of the river-bed; <span class="stiki" id="note302850"><a href="../bible/jos003.htm#verse17">Joshua&nbsp;3:17</a></span> how afterwards at the command of Elijah and Elisha the waters were divided here and there and made way for them to pass; and again how the Lord had cleansed by His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> waters which the deluge had polluted and the destruction of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> had defiled.</p>

<p>13. It would be tedious were I tell of the valley of Achor, that is, of 'trouble and crowds,' where theft and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> were condemned; <span class="stiki" id="note302851"><a href="../bible/jos007.htm#verse24">Joshua&nbsp;7:24-26</a></span> and of Bethel, 'the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' where Jacob poor and destitute slept upon the bare ground. Here it was that, having set beneath his head a stone which in Zechariah is described as having seven eyes <span class="stiki" id="note302852"><a href="../bible/zec003.htm#verse9">Zechariah&nbsp;3:9</a></span> and in Isaiah is spoken of as a corner-stone, <span class="stiki" id="note302853"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse16">Isaiah&nbsp;28:16</a></span> he beheld a ladder reaching up to heaven; yes, and the Lord standing high above it <span class="stiki" id="note302854"><a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;28:12-13</a></span> holding out His hand to such as were ascending and hurling from on high such as were careless. Also when she was in Mount Ephraim she made pilgrimages to the tombs of Joshua the son of Nun and of Eleazar the son of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, exactly opposite the one to the other; that of Joshua being built at Timnath-serah <q>on the north side of the hill of Gaash,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302855"><a href="../bible/jos024.htm#verse30">Joshua&nbsp;24:30</a></span> and that of Eleazar <q>in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302856"><a href="../bible/jos024.htm#verse33">Joshua&nbsp;24:33</a></span> She was somewhat surprised to find that he who had had the distribution of the land in his own hands had selected for himself portions uneven and rocky. What shall I say about Shiloh where a ruined altar <span class="stiki" id="note302857"><a href="../bible/1sa001.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;1:3</a></span> is still shown today, and where the tribe of Benjamin anticipated Romulus in the rape of the Sabine <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>?  Passing by Shechem (not Sychar as many wrongly read ) or as it is now called Neapolis, she entered the church built upon the side of Mount Gerizim around Jacob's well; that well where the Lord was sitting when hungry and thirsty He was refreshed by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. Forsaking her five husbands by whom are intended the five books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and that sixth not a husband of whom she boasted, to wit the false teacher <a href="../cathen/05136c.htm">Dositheus</a>,  she found the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Messiah and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Saviour. Turning away thence <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> saw the tombs of the twelve patriarchs, and <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a> which in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of Augustus <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> renamed Augusta or in Greek Sebaste. There lie the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> Elisha and Obadiah and John the Baptist than whom there is not a greater among those that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302861"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;7:28</a></span> And here she was filled with terror by the marvels she beheld; for she saw <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> screaming under different tortures before the tombs of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and men howling like wolves, baying like dogs, roaring like lions, hissing like serpents and bellowing like bulls. They twisted their heads and bent them backwards until they touched the ground; <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> too were suspended head downward and their clothes did not fall off.  <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> pitied them all, and shedding tears over them <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> Christ to have mercy on them. And weak as she was she climbed the mountain on foot; for in two of its caves Obadiah in a time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> and famine had fed a hundred <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with bread and water. <span class="stiki" id="note302863"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;18:4</a></span> Then she passed quickly through <a href="../cathen/10725a.htm">Nazareth</a> the nursery of the Lord; <a href="../cathen/03226a.htm">Cana</a> and Capernaum familiar with the signs wrought by Him; the lake of Tiberias sanctified by His voyages upon it; the wilderness where countless <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> were satisfied with a few loaves while the twelve baskets of the tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were filled with the fragments left by them that had eaten. <span class="stiki" id="note302864"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;14:13-21</a></span> She made the ascent of mount Tabor whereon the Lord was transfigured.  In the distance she beheld the range of Hermon;  and the wide stretching plains of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> where Sisera and all his host had once been overcome by Barak; and the torrent <span class="stiki" id="note302867"><a href="../bible/jdg005.htm#verse21">Judges&nbsp;5:21</a></span> Kishon separating the level ground into two parts. Hard by also the town of Nain was pointed out to her, where the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> son was raised. <span class="stiki" id="note302868"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;7:11-15</a></span> Time would fail me sooner than speech were I to recount all the places to which the revered <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> was carried by her incredible <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>14. I will now pass on to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, pausing for a while on the way at Socoh, and at Samson's well which he clave in the hollow place that was in the jaw.  Here I will lave my parched lips and refresh myself before visiting Moresheth; in old days famed for the tomb of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Micah,  and now for its church. Then skirting the country of the Horites and Gittites, Mareshah, Edom, and Lachish, and traversing the lonely wastes of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> where the tracks of the traveller are lost in the yielding sand, I will come to the river of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> called Sihor, <span class="stiki" id="note302871"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse18">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:18</a></span> that is <q>the muddy river,</q> and go through the five cities of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> which speak the language of Canaan, <span class="stiki" id="note302872"><a href="../bible/isa019.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;19:18</a></span> and through the land of Goshen and the plains of Zoan  on which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> wrought his marvellous works. And I will visit the city of No, which has since become Alexandria;  and Nitria, the town of the Lord, where day by day the filth of multitudes is washed away with the pure nitre of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. No sooner did <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> come in sight of it than there came to meet her the reverend and estimable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the confessor Isidore, accompanied by countless multitudes of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> many of whom were of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> or of Levitical rank.  On seeing these <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> rejoiced to behold the Lord's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> manifested in them; but protested that she had no claim to be received with such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Need I speak of the Macarii, Arsenius, Serapion,  or other pillars of Christ! Was there any cell that she did not enter? Or any man at whose feet she did not throw herself? In each of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that she saw Christ Himself; and whatever she bestowed upon them she rejoiced to feel that she had bestowed it upon the Lord. Her enthusiasm was wonderful and her endurance scarcely credible in a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Forgetful of her sex and of her weakness she even desired to make her abode, together with the girls who accompanied her, among these thousands of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. And, as they were all willing to welcome her, she might perhaps have sought and obtained permission to do so; had she not been drawn away by a still greater passion for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places. Coming by sea from Pelusium to Maioma on account of the great heat, she returned so rapidly that you would have thought her a bird. Not long afterwards, making up her mind to dwell permanently in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, she took up her abode for three years in a miserable hostelry; till she could build the requisite cells and monastic buildings, to say nothing of a guest house for passing travellers where they might find the welcome which Mary and Joseph had missed. At this point I conclude my narrative of the journeys that she made accompanied by <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> and many other <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.</p>

<p>15. I am now free to describe at greater length the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which was her peculiar charm; and in setting forth this I call God to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that I am no flatterer. I add nothing. I exaggerate nothing. On the contrary I tone down much that I may not appear to relate incredibilities. My carping critics must not insinuate that I am drawing on my imagination or decking <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, like &AElig;sop's crow, with the fine feathers of other birds. Humility is the first of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> graces, and hers was so pronounced that one who had never seen her, and who on account of her celebrity had desired to see her, would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that he saw not her but the lowest of her maids. When she was surrounded by companies of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> she was always the least remarkable in dress, in speech, in gesture, and in gait. From the time that her husband died until she fell asleep herself she never sat at meat with a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, even though she might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him to stand upon the pinnacle of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. She never entered a bath except when dangerously ill. Even in the severest fever she rested not on an ordinary bed but on the hard ground covered only with a mat of goat's hair; if that can be called rest which made day and night alike a time of almost unbroken <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Well did she fulfil the words of the psalter: <q>All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears</q>!  Her tears welled forth as it were from fountains, and she lamented her slightest faults as if they were <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the deepest dye. Constantly did I warn her to spare her eyes and to keep them for the reading of the gospel; but she only said: 'I must disfigure that face which contrary to God's commandment I have painted with rouge, white lead, and antimony. I must mortify that body which has been given up to many pleasures. I must make up for my long laughter by constant weeping. I must exchange my soft linen and costly silks for rough goat's hair. I who have pleased my husband and the world in the past, desire now to please Christ.' Were I among her great and signal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to select her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> as a subject of praise, my words would seem superfluous; for, even when she was still in the world, she set an example to all the matrons of Rome, and bore herself so admirably that the most <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> never ventured to couple scandal with her name.  No mind could be more considerate than hers, or none kinder towards the lowly. She did not court the powerful; at the same time, if the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and the vainglorious sought her, she did not turn from them with disdain. If she saw a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man, she supported him: and if she saw a rich one, she urged him to do good. Her liberality alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no bounds. Indeed, so anxious was she to turn no needy person away that she borrowed money at interest and often contracted new loans to pay off old ones. I was wrong, I admit; but when I saw her so profuse in giving, I reproved her alleging the apostle's words: <q>I mean not that other men be eased and you burthened; but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302879"><a href="../bible/2co008.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:13-14</a></span> I quoted from the gospel the Saviour's words: <q>he that has two coats, let him impart one of them to him that has none</q>;  and I warned her that she might not always have means to do as she would wish. Other arguments I adduced to the same purpose; but with admirable modesty and brevity she overruled them all. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>,</q> she said, <q>that what I do I do for His sake. My <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is that I may die a beggar not leaving a penny to my daughter and indebted to strangers for my winding sheet.</q> She then concluded with these words: <q>I, if I beg, shall find many to give to me; but if this beggar does not obtain help from me who by borrowing can give it to him, he will die; and if he dies, of whom will his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be required?</q> I wished her to be more careful in managing her concerns, but she with a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> more glowing than mine clave to the Saviour with her whole heart and poor in spirit followed the Lord in His poverty, giving back to Him what she had received and becoming poor for His sake. She obtained her wish at last and died leaving her daughter overwhelmed with a mass of debt. This <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> still owes and indeed cannot hope to pay off by her own exertions; only the mercy of Christ can free her from it.</p>

<p>16. Many married ladies make it a habit to confer gifts upon their own trumpeters, and while they are extremely profuse to a few, withhold all help from the many. From this fault <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> was altogether free. She gave her money to each according as each had need, not ministering to self-indulgence but relieving want. No poor person went away from her empty handed. And all this she was enabled to do not by the greatness of her <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> but by her careful management of it. She constantly had on her lips such phrases as these: <q>Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302881"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;5:7</a></span> and <q>water will quench a flaming fire; and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> makes an atonement for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302882"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse30">Sirach&nbsp;3:30</a></span> and <q>make to yourselves friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness that...they may receive you into everlasting habitations;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302883"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;16:9</a></span> and <q>give alms...and behold all things are clean unto you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302884"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;11:41</a></span> and Daniel's words to King <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> in which he admonished him to redeem his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by almsgiving.  She wished to spend her money not upon these stones, that shall pass away with the earth and the world, but upon those living stones, which roll over the earth;  of which in the apocalypse of John the city of the great king is built; <span class="stiki" id="note302887"><a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse14">Revelation&nbsp;21:14</a></span> of which also the scripture tells us that they shall be changed into sapphire and emerald and jasper and other gems. <span class="stiki" id="note302888"><a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse19">Revelation&nbsp;21:19-21</a></span> </p>

<p>17. But these qualities she may well share with a few others and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it is not in these that the highest <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> consists. For, when Job has lost his substance and when his house and children have been destroyed, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> says to the Lord: <q>Skin for skin, yea all that a man has, will he give for his life. But put forth your hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302889"><a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse4">Job&nbsp;2:4-5</a></span> We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> while they have given <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> have yet given nothing which touches their bodily comfort; and while they have held out a helping hand to those in need are themselves overcome with sensual indulgences; they whitewash  the outside but within they are <q>full of dead men's bones.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302890"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;23:27</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> was not one of these. Her self-restraint was so great as to be almost immoderate; and her <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> and labours were so severe as almost to weaken her constitution. Except on feast days she would scarcely ever take oil with her food; a fact from which may be judged what she thought of wine, sauce, fish, honey, milk, eggs, and other things agreeable to the palate. Some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in taking these they are extremely frugal; and, even if they surfeit themselves with them, they still fancy their <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> safe.</p>

<p>18. Envy always follows in the track of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: as Horace says, it is ever the mountain top that is smitten by the lightning.  It is not surprising that I declare this of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, when the jealousy of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> succeeded in crucifying our Lord Himself. All the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have had illwishers, and even Paradise was not free from the serpent through whose <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> death came into the world. <span class="stiki" id="note302892"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom&nbsp;2:24</a></span> So the Lord stirred up against <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> Hadad the Edomite  to buffet her that she might not be exalted, and warned her frequently by the thorn in her flesh <span class="stiki" id="note302894"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7</a></span> not to be elated by the greatness of her own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> or to fancy that, compared with other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, she had attained the summit of perfection. For my part I used to say that it was best to give in to rancour and to retire before passion. So Jacob dealt with his brother <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>; so David met the unrelenting <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of Saul. I reminded her how the first of these fled into Mesopotamia;  and how the second surrendered himself to the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302896"><a href="../bible/1sa021.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;21:10</a></span> and chose to submit to foreign foes rather than to enemies at home. She however replied as follows:&mdash; 'Your suggestion would be a wise one if the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> did not everywhere fight against God's servants and handmaidens, and did he not always precede the fugitives to their chosen refuges. Moreover, I am deterred from accepting it by my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places; and I cannot find another <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> elsewhere. Why may I not by my patience conquer this ill will? Why may I not by my humility break down this <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and when I am smitten on the one cheek offer to the smiter the other? <span class="stiki" id="note302897"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39</a></span> Surely the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says <q>Overcome <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with good.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302898"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;12:21</a></span> Did not the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> when they suffered reproach for the Lord's sake? Did not even the Saviour <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> Himself, taking the form of a servant and being made <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the Father unto death, even the death of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302899"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7-8</a></span> that He might save us by His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>? If Job had not fought the battle and won the victory, he would never have received the crown of righteousness, or have heard the Lord say: <q>Do you think that I have spoken unto you for anything else than this, that you might appear righteous.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302900"><a href="../bible/job040.htm#verse8">Job&nbsp;40:8</a></span> In the gospel those only are said to be blessed who suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for righteousness' sake. <span class="stiki" id="note302901"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;5:10</a></span> My <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is at rest, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not from any fault of mine that I am suffering; moreover affliction in this world is a ground for expecting a reward hereafter.' When the enemy was more than usually forward and ventured to reproach her to her face, she used to chant the words of the psalter: <q>While the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> was before me, I was dumb with silence; I held my peace even from good:</q>  and again, <q>I as a deaf man heard not; and I was as a dumb man that opens not his mouth:</q>  and <q>I was as a man that hears not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</q>  When she felt herself tempted, she dwelt upon the words in Deuteronomy: <q>The Lord your God proves you, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302905"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:3</a></span> In tribulations and afflictions she turned to the splendid language of Isaiah: <q>You that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts, look for tribulation upon tribulation, for hope also upon hope: yet a little while must these things be by reason of the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the lips and by reason of a spiteful tongue.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302906"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;28:9-11</a></span> This passage of scripture she explained for her own consolation as meaning that the weaned, that is, those who have come to full age, must endure tribulation upon tribulation that they may be accounted worthy to receive hope upon hope.

She replied in the words of the apostle, <q>we are made a spectacle unto the world and to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302931"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:9</a></span> and <q>we are fools for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302932"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:10</a></span> but <q>the foolishness of God is wiser than men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302933"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:25</a></span> It is for this reason she said that even the Saviour says to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my foolishness,</q>  and again <q>I am as a wonder unto many, but you are my strong refuge.</q>  <q>I was as a beast before you; nevertheless I am continually with you.</q>  In the gospel we read that even His kinsfolk desired to bind Him as one of weak mind. <span class="stiki" id="note302937"><a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;3:21</a></span> His opponents also reviled him saying <q>you are a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> and hast a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302938"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;8:48</a></span> and another time <q>he casts out devils through <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> the chief of the devils.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302939"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;11:15</a></span> But let us, she continued, listen to the exhortation of the apostle, <q>Our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> that in simplicity and sincerity...by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God we have had our conversation in the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302940"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:12</a></span> And let us hear the Lord when He says to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, <q>If you were of the world the world would <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> his own; but because you are not of the world...therefore the world <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302941"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;15:19</a></span> And then she turned to the Lord Himself, saying, <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the secrets of the heart,</q>  and <q>all this has come upon us; yet have we not forgotten you, neither have we dealt <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> in your covenant; our heart is not turned back.</q>  <q>Yea for your sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</q>  But <q>the Lord is on my side: I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what man does unto me.</q>  She had read the words of Solomon, <q>My son, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Lord and you shall be made strong; and beside the Lord <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> thou no man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302946"><a href="../bible/pro007.htm#verse2">Proverbs&nbsp;7:2</a></span> These passages and others like them she used as God's armour against the assaults of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and particularly to defend herself against the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> onslaughts of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>; and thus by patiently enduring wrongs she soothed the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the most savage breasts. Down to the very day of her death two things were conspicuous in her life, one her great patience and the other the jealousy which was manifested towards her. Now jealousy gnaws the heart of him who harbours it: and while it strives to injure its rival raves with all the force of its fury against itself.</p>

<p>20. I shall now describe the order of her <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and the method by which she turned the continence of saintly <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to her own profit. She sowed carnal things that she might reap spiritual things; <span class="stiki" id="note302947"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:11</a></span> she gave earthly things that she might receive heavenly things; she forewent things temporal that she might in their stead obtain things <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Besides establishing a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> for men, the charge of which she left to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, she divided into three companies and <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> the numerous <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> whom she had gathered out of different provinces, some of whom are of noble birth while others belonged to the middle or lower classes. But, although they worked and had their meals separately from each other, these three companies met together for psalm-singing and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. After the chanting of the <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>&mdash; the signal by which they were summoned to the Collect &mdash; no one was permitted to remain behind. But either first or among the first <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> used to await the arrival of the rest, urging them to diligence rather by her own modest example than by motives of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. At dawn, at the third, sixth, and ninth hours, at evening, and at midnight they recited the psalter each in turn.  No sister was allowed to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the psalms, and all had every day to learn a certain portion of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures. On the Lord's day only they proceeded to the church beside which they lived, each company following its own mother-superior. Returning home in the same order, they then devoted themselves to their allotted tasks, and made garments either for themselves or else for others. If a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> was of noble birth, she was not allowed to have an attendant belonging to her own household lest her maid having her mind full of the doings of old days and of the license of childhood might by constant converse open old wounds and renew former <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. All the sisters were clothed alike. Linen was not used except for drying the hands. So strictly did <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> separate them from men that she would not allow even eunuchs to approach them; lest she should give occasion to <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> tongues (always ready to cavil at the religious) to console themselves for their own misdoing. When a sister was backward in coming to the recitation of the psalms or showed herself remiss in her work, <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> used to approach her in different ways. Was she quick-tempered? <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> coaxed her. Was she phlegmatic? <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> chid her, copying the example of the apostle who said: <q>What will you? Shall I come to you with a rod or in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and in the spirit of meekness?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302950"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:21</a></span> Apart from food and raiment she allowed no one to have anything she could call her own, for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> had said, <q>Having food and raiment let us be therewith content.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302951"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:8</a></span> She was afraid lest the custom of having more should breed <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> in them; an appetite which no <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> can satisfy, for the more it has the more it requires, and neither opulence nor indigence is able to diminish it.  When the sisters quarrelled one with another she reconciled them with soothing words. If the younger ones were troubled with fleshly desires, she broke their force by imposing redoubled <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>; for she wished her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to be ill in body rather than to suffer in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If she chanced to notice any sister too attentive to her dress, she reproved her for her <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> with knitted brows and severe looks, saying; <q>a clean body and a clean dress mean an unclean <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. A virgin's lips should never utter an improper or an impure word, for such indicate a lascivious mind and by the outward man the faults of the inward are made manifest.</q> When she saw a sister verbose and talkative or forward and taking pleasure in quarrels, and when she found after frequent admonitions that the offender showed no signs of improvement; she placed her among the lowest of the sisters and outside their society, ordering her to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> at the door of the refectory instead of with the rest, and commanding her to take her food by herself, in the hope that where rebuke had failed shame might bring about a reformation. The <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of theft she loathed as if it were sacrilege; and that which among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of the world is counted little or nothing she declared to be in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> a crime of the deepest dye. How shall I describe her kindness and attention towards the sick or the wonderful care and devotion with which she nursed them? Yet, although when others were sick she freely gave them every indulgence, and even allowed them to eat meat; when she fell ill herself, she made no concessions to her own weakness, and seemed unfairly to change in her own case to harshness the kindness which she was always ready to show to others.</p>

<p>21. No young girl of sound and vigorous constitution could have delivered herself up to a regimen so rigid as that imposed upon herself by <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> whose physical powers age had impaired and enfeebled. I admit that in this she was too determined, refusing to spare herself or to listen to advice. I will relate what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be a fact. In the extreme heat of the month of July she was once attacked by a violent fever and we despaired of her life. However by God's mercy she rallied, and the doctors urged upon her the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of taking a little light wine to accelerate her recovery; saying that if she continued to drink water they feared that she might become dropsical. I on my side secretly appealed to the blessed pope Epiphanius to admonish, nay even to compel her, to take the wine. But she with her usual sagacity and quickness at once perceived the stratagem, and with a smile let him see that the advice he was giving her was after all not his but mine. Not to waste more words, the blessed prelate after many exhortations left her chamber; and, when I asked him what he had accomplished, replied, <q>Only this that old as I am I have been almost persuaded to drink no more wine.</q> I relate this story not because I approve of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> rashly taking upon themselves burthens beyond their strength (for does not the scripture say: <q>Burden not yourself above your power</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note302953"><a href="../bible/sir013.htm#verse2">Sirach&nbsp;13:2</a></span>) but because I wish from this quality of perseverance in her to show the passion of her mind and the yearning of her believing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; both of which made her sing in David's words, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> thirsts for you, my flesh longs after you.</q>  Difficult as it is always to avoid extremes, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>  are quite right in their opinion that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a mean and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> an excess, or as we may express it in one short sentence <q>In nothing too much.</q>  While thus unyielding in her contempt for food <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> was easily moved to sorrow and felt crushed by the deaths of her kinsfolk, especially those of her children. When one after another her husband and her daughters fell asleep, on each occasion the shock of their loss endangered her life. And although she signed her mouth and her breast with the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and endeavoured thus to alleviate a mother's grief; her feelings overpowered her and her maternal instincts were too much for her confiding mind. Thus while her <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> retained its mastery she was overcome by sheer physical weakness. On one occasion a sickness seized her and clung to her so long that it brought anxiety to us and danger to herself. Yet even then she was full of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and repeated every moment the apostle's words: <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302957"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> </p>

<p>The careful reader may say that my words are an invective rather than an eulogy. I call that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> whom she served and whom I desire to serve to be my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that so far from unduly eulogizing her or depreciating her I tell the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about her as one <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> writing of another; that I am writing a memoir and not a panegyric, and that what were faults in her might well be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in others less saintly. I speak thus of her faults to satisfy my own feelings and the passionate regret of us her brothers and sisters, who all of us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> her still and all of us deplore her loss.</p>

<p>22. However, she has finished her course, she has kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and now she enjoys the crown of righteousness. <span class="stiki" id="note302958"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:7-8</a></span> She follows the Lamb wherever he goes. <span class="stiki" id="note302959"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;14:4</a></span> She is filled now because once she was hungry. <span class="stiki" id="note302960"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;6:21</a></span> With <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> does she sing: <q>as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God.</q>  O blessed change! Once she wept but now laughs for evermore. Once she despised the broken cisterns of which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speaks; <span class="stiki" id="note302962"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:13</a></span> but now she has found in the Lord a fountain of life. <span class="stiki" id="note302963"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span> Once she wore haircloth but now she is clothed in white raiment, and can say: <q>you have put off my sackcloth, and girded me with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>.</q>  Once she ate ashes like bread and mingled her drink with weeping;  saying <q>my tears have been my meat day and night;</q>  but now for all time she eats the bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>  and sings: <q>O taste and see that the Lord is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>;</q>  and <q>my heart is overflowing with a goodly matter; I speak the things which I have made touching the king.</q>  She now sees fulfilled Isaiah's words, or rather those of the Lord speaking through Isaiah: <q>Behold, my servants shall eat but you shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink but you shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, but you shall be ashamed: behold, my servants shall sing for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302970"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;65:13-14</a></span> I have said that she always shunned the broken cisterns: she did so that she might find in the Lord a fountain of life, and that she might <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and sing: <q>as the hart pants after the waterbrooks, so pants my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after You, O God. When shall I come and appear before God?</q> </p>

<p>23. I must briefly mention the manner in which she avoided the foul cisterns of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> whom she regarded as no better than <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. A certain cunning knave, in his own estimation both learned and clever, began without  my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to put to her such questions as these: What <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has an infant committed that it should be seized by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>? Shall we be young or old when we rise again? If we die young and rise young, we shall after the resurrection require to have nurses. If however we die young and rise old, the dead will not rise again at all: they will be transformed into new beings. Will there be a distinction of sexes in the next world? Or will there be no such distinction? If the distinction continues, there will be wedlock and sexual intercourse and procreation of children. If however it does not continue, the bodies that rise again will not be the same. For, he argued, <q>the earthy tabernacle weighs down the mind that muses upon many things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302972"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> but the bodies that we shall have in heaven will be subtle and spiritual according to the words of the apostle: <q>it is sown a natural body: it is raised a spiritual body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302973"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse44">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:44</a></span> From all of which considerations he sought to prove that rational creatures have been for their faults and previous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> subjected to bodily conditions; and that according to the nature and guilt of their transgression they are born in this or that state of life. Some, he said, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in sound bodies and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and noble <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; others have for their portion diseased frames and poverty stricken homes; and by imprisonment in the present world and in bodies pay the penalty of their former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> listened and reported what she heard to me, at the same time pointing out the man. Thus upon me was laid the task of opposing this most noxious viper and deadly pest. It is of such that the Psalmist speaks when he writes: <q>deliver not the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of your turtle dove unto the wild beast,</q>  and <q>Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds;</q>  creatures who write iniquity and speak lies against the Lord and lift up their mouths against the Most High. As the fellow had tried to deceive <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, I at her request went to him, and by asking him a few questions involved him in a dilemma. Do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, said I, that there will be a resurrection of the dead or do you disbelieve? He replied, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. I went on: Will the bodies that rise again be the same or different? He said, The same. Then I asked: What of their sex? Will that remain unaltered or will it be changed? At this question he became silent and swayed his head this way and that as a serpent does to avoid being struck. Accordingly I continued, As you have nothing to say I will answer for you and will draw the conclusion from your premises. If the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall not rise again as a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> nor the man as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, there will be no resurrection of the dead. For the body is made up of sex and members. But if there shall be no sex and no members what will become of the resurrection of the body, which cannot exist without sex and members? And if there shall be no resurrection of the body, there can be no resurrection of the dead. But as to your objection taken from marriage, that, if the members shall remain the same, marriage must inevitably be allowed; it is disposed of by the Saviour's words: <q>ye do <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the scriptures nor the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302976"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;22:29-30</a></span> When it is said that they neither marry nor are given in marriage, the distinction of sex is shown to persist. For no one says of things which have no capacity for marriage such as a stick or a stone that they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but this may well be said of those who while they can marry yet abstain from doing so by their own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But if you cavil at this and say, how shall we in that case be like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> with whom there is neither male nor female, hear my answer in brief as follows. What the Lord promises to us is not the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> but their mode of life and their bliss. And therefore John the Baptist is called an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>  even before he is beheaded, and all God's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> manifest in themselves even in this world the life of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. When it is said <q>you shall be like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> likeness only is promised and not a change of nature.</p>

<p>24. And now do you in your turn answer me these questions. How do you explain the fact that Thomas felt the hands of the risen Lord and beheld His side pierced by the spear? <span class="stiki" id="note302978"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;20:26-28</a></span> And the fact that Peter saw the Lord standing on the shore <span class="stiki" id="note302979"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;21:4</a></span> and eating a piece of a roasted fish and a honeycomb. <span class="stiki" id="note302980"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;24:42-43</a></span> If He stood, He must certainly have had feet. If He pointed to His wounded side He must have also had chest and belly for to these the sides are attached and without them they cannot be. If He spoke, He must have used a tongue and palate and teeth. For as the bow strikes the strings, so to produce vocal sound does the tongue come in contact with the teeth. If His hands were felt, it follows that He must have had arms as well. Since therefore it is admitted that He had all the members which go to make up the body, He must have also had the whole body formed of them, and that not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> but a man's; that is to say, He rose again in the sex in which He died. And if you cavil farther and say: We shall eat then, I suppose, after the resurrection; or How can a solid and material body enter in contrary to its nature through closed doors? You shall receive from me this reply. Do not for this matter of food find fault with belief in the resurrection: for our Lord after raising the daughter of the ruler of the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> commanded food to be given her. <span class="stiki" id="note302981"><a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse43">Mark&nbsp;5:43</a></span> And Lazarus who had been dead four days is described as sitting at meat with Him, <span class="stiki" id="note302982"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;12:2</a></span> the object in both cases being to show that the resurrection was real and not merely apparent. And if from our Lord's entering in through closed doors <span class="stiki" id="note302983"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;20:19</a></span> you strive to prove that His body was spiritual and aerial, He must have had this spiritual body even before He suffered; since&mdash; contrary to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of heavy bodies&mdash; He was able to walk upon the sea. <span class="stiki" id="note302984"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;14:25</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> also must be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have had a spiritual body for he also walked upon the waters with buoyant step. <span class="stiki" id="note302985"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;14:29</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> explanation is that when anything is done against nature, it is a manifestation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s might and power. And to show plainly that in these great signs our attention is asked not to a change in nature but to the almighty power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he who by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> had walked on water began to sink for the want of it and would have done so had not the Lord lifted him up with the reproving words, <q>O thou of little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> wherefore did you <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302986"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse31">Matthew&nbsp;14:31</a></span> I wonder that you can display such effrontery when the Lord Himself said, <q>reach hither your finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither your hand and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless but believing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302987"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;20:27</a></span> and in another place, <q>behold my hands and my feet that it is I myself: handle me and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me have. And when he had thus spoken he showed them his hands and his feet.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302988"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;24:39-40</a></span> You hear Him speak of bones and flesh, of feet and hands; and yet you want to palm off on me the bubbles and airy nothings of which the stoics rave! </p>

<p>25. Moreover, if you ask how it is that a mere infant which has never <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> is seized by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, or at what age we shall rise again seeing that we die at different ages; my only answer&mdash; an unwelcome one, I fancy&mdash; will be in the words of scripture: <q>The judgments of God are a great deep,</q>  and <q>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! For who has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counsellor?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302991"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33-34</a></span> No difference of age can affect the reality of the body. Although our frames are in a perpetual flux and lose or gain daily, these changes do not make us different individuals. I was not one person at ten years old, another at thirty and another at fifty; nor am I another now when all my head is gray.  According to the traditions of the church and the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the answer must be this; that we shall rise as perfect men in the measure of the stature of the fullness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302993"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse13">Ephesians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> At this age the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> suppose <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to have been created and at this age we read that the Lord and Saviour rose again. Many other arguments did I adduce from both testaments to stifle the outcry of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>.</p>

<p>26. From that day forward so profoundly did <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> commence to loathe the man&mdash; and all who agreed with him in his doctrines&mdash; that she publicly proclaimed them as enemies of the Lord. I have related this incident less with the design of confuting in a few words a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which would require volumes to confute it, than with the object of showing the great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of this saintly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who preferred to subject herself to perpetual hostility from men rather than by friendships hurtful to herself to provoke or to offend God.</p>

<p>27. To revert then to that description of her character which I began a little time ago; no mind was ever more docile than was hers. She was slow to speak and swift to hear, <span class="stiki" id="note302994"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse19">James&nbsp;1:19</a></span> remembering the precept, <q>Keep silence and hearken, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> by heart, and said of the history contained in them that it was the foundation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but, though she loved even this, she still preferred to seek for the underlying spiritual meaning and made this the keystone of the spiritual building raised within her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. She asked leave that she and her daughter might read over the old and new testaments  under my guidance. Out of modesty I at first refused compliance, but as she persisted in her demand and frequently urged me to consent to it, I at last did so and taught her what I had learned not from myself&mdash; for self-confidence is the worst of teachers&mdash; but from the church's most famous writers. Wherever I stuck fast and honestly confessed myself at fault she would by no means rest content but would force me by fresh questions to point out to her which of many different solutions seemed to me the most probable. I will mention here another fact which to those who are <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> may well seem incredible. While I myself beginning as a young man have with much toil and effort partially acquired the Hebrew tongue and study it now unceasingly  lest if I leave it, it also may leave me; <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, on making up her mind that she too would learn it, succeeded so well that she could chant the psalms in Hebrew and could speak the language without a trace of the pronunciation peculiar to Latin. The same accomplishment can be seen to this day in her daughter <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, who always kept close to her mother's side, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> all her commands, never slept apart from her, never walked abroad or took a meal without her, never had a penny that she could call her own, rejoiced when her mother gave to the poor her little patrimony, and fully <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that in filial affection she had the best heritage and the truest riches. I must not pass over in silence the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> felt when she heard her little granddaughter and namesake, the child of Laeta and Toxotius&mdash; who was born and I may even say conceived in answer to a vow of her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> dedicating her to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>&mdash; when, I say, she heard the little one in her cradle sing <q>alleluia</q> and falter out the words <q>grandmother</q> and <q>aunt.</q> One wish alone made her long to see her native land again; that she might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> her son and his wife and child  to have renounced the world and to be serving Christ. And it has been granted to her in part. For while her granddaughter is destined to take the veil, her daughter-in-law has vowed herself to perpetual <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> emulates the example that her mother has set her. She strives to exhibit at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> which <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> set forth in all their fullness at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>28. What ails you, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Why do you shudder to approach her death? I have made my letter longer than it should be already; dreading to come to the end and vainly supposing that by saying nothing of it and by occupying myself with her praises I could postpone the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day. Hitherto the wind has been all in my favour and my keel has smoothly ploughed through the heaving waves. But now my speech is running upon the rocks, the billows are mountains high, and imminent shipwreck awaits both you and me. We must needs cry out: <q>Master; save us we perish:</q>  and <q>awake, why do you sleep, O Lord?</q>  For who could tell the tale of <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula's</a> dying with dry eyes? She fell into a most serious illness and thus gained what she most desired, power to leave us and to be joined more fully to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium's</a> affection for her mother, always <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and tried, in this time of sickness approved itself still more to all. She sat by <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula's</a> bedside, she fanned her, she supported her head, she arranged her pillows, she chafed her feet, she rubbed her stomach, she smoothed down the bedclothes, she heated hot water, she brought towels. In fact she anticipated the servants in all their duties, and when one of them did anything she regarded it as so much taken away from her own gain. How unceasingly she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, how copiously she wept, how constantly she ran to and fro between her prostrate mother and the cave of the Lord! Imploring God that she might not be deprived of a companion so dear, that if <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> was to die she might herself no longer live, and that one bier might carry to burial her and her mother. Alas for the frailty and perishableness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>! Except that our belief in Christ raises us up to heaven and promises <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> to our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the physical conditions of life are the same for us as for the brutes. <q>There is one event to the righteous and to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; to the good and to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; to the clean and to the unclean; to him that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and to him that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> not: as is the good so is the sinner; and he that swears as he that fears an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303000"><a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse2">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;9:2</a></span> Man and beast alike are dissolved into dust and ashes.</p>

<p>29. Why do I still linger, and prolong my suffering by postponing it? <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula's</a> intelligence showed her that her death was near. Her body and limbs grew cold and only in her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> breast did the warm beat of the living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> continue. Yet, as though she were leaving strangers to go home to her own people, she whispered the verses of the psalmist: <q>Lord, I have loved the habitation of your house and the place where your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> dwells,</q>  and <q>How amiable are your tabernacles, O Lord of hosts! My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> longs yea even faints for the courts of the Lord,</q>  and <q>I had rather be an outcast in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q>  When I asked her why she remained silent refusing to answer my call,  and whether she was in pain, she replied in Greek that she had no suffering and that all things were to her eyes calm and tranquil. After this she said no more but closed her eyes as though she already despised all mortal things, and kept repeating the verses just quoted down to the moment in which she breathed out her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but in a tone so low that we could scarcely hear what she said. Raising her finger also to her mouth she made the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> upon her lips. Then her breath failed her and she gasped for death; yet even when her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was eager to break free, she turned the death-rattle (which comes at last to all) into the praise of the Lord. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Jerusalem and some from other cities were present, also a great number of the inferior <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, both <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and levites.  The entire <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> was filled with bodies of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. As soon as <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> heard the bridegroom saying: <q>Rise up my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> my fair one, my dove, and come away: for, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone,</q> she answered joyfully <q>the flowers appear on the earth; the time to cut them has come</q>  and <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I shall see the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the Lord in the land of the living.</q> </p>

<p>30. No weeping or lamentation followed her death, such as are the custom of the world; but all present united in chanting the psalms in their several tongues. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> lifted up the dead <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with their own hands, placed her upon a bier, and carrying her on their shoulders to the church in the cave of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, laid her down in the centre of it. Other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> meantime carried torches and tapers in the procession, and yet others led the singing of the choirs. The whole population of the cities of Palestine came to her funeral. Not a single <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> lurked in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> or lingered in his cell. Not a single virgin remained shut up in the seclusion of her chamber. To each and all it would have seemed sacrilege to have withheld the last tokens of respect from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> so saintly. As in the case of Dorcas, <span class="stiki" id="note303008"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse39">Acts&nbsp;9:39</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and the poor showed the garments <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> had given them; while the destitute cried aloud that they had lost in her a mother and a nurse. Strange to say, the paleness of death had not altered her expression; only a certain <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> and seriousness had overspread her features. You would have thought her not dead but asleep.</p>

<p>One after another they chanted the psalms, now in Greek, now in Latin, now in Syriac; and this not merely for the three days which elapsed before she was buried beneath the church and close to the cave of the Lord, but throughout the remainder of the week. All who were assembled felt that it was their own funeral at which they were assisting, and shed tears as if they themselves had died. <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula's</a> daughter, the revered virgin <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, <q>as a child that is weaned of his mother,</q>  could not be torn away from her parent. She kissed her eyes, pressed her lips upon her brow, embraced her frame, and wished for nothing better than to be buried with her.</p>

<p>31. Jesus is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> has left not a single penny to her daughter but, as I said before, on the contrary a large mass of debt; and, worse even than this, a crowd of brothers and sisters whom it is hard for her to support but whom it would be undutiful to cast off. Could there be a more splendid instance of self-renunciation than that of this noble lady who in the fervour of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> gave away so much of her <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> that she reduced herself to the last degree of poverty? Others may boast, if they will, of money spent in charity, of large sums heaped up in God's treasury,  of votive offerings hung up with cords of gold. None of them has given more to the poor than <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, for <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> has kept nothing for herself. But now she enjoys the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches and those <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which eye has not seen nor ear heard, neither have they entered into the heart of man. <span class="stiki" id="note303011"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> If we mourn, it is for ourselves and not for her; yet even so, if we persist in weeping for one who reigns with Christ, we shall seem to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> her her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p>32. Be not fearful, <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>: you are endowed with a splendid heritage. The Lord is your portion; and, to increase your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, your mother has now after a long <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> won her crown. It is not only the shedding of blood that is accounted a confession: the spotless service of a devout mind is itself a daily <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Both alike are crowned; with roses and violets in the one case, with lilies in the other. Thus in the Song of Songs it is written: <q>my beloved is white and ruddy;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303012"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse10">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:10</a></span> for, whether the victory be won in peace or in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, God gives the same reward to those who win it. Like <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> your mother heard the words: <q>get out of your country, and from your kindred, unto a land that I will show you;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303013"><a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;12:1</a></span> and not only that but the Lord's command given through Jeremiah: <q>flee out of the midst of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, and deliver every man his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303014"><a href="../bible/jer051.htm#verse6">Jeremiah&nbsp;51:6</a></span> To the day of her death she never returned to Chald&aelig;a, or regretted the fleshpots of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> or its strong-smelling meats. Accompanied by her virgin bands she became a fellow-citizen of the Saviour; and now that she has ascended from her little <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to the heavenly realms she can say to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Naomi: <q>your people shall be my people and your God my God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303015"><a href="../bible/rut001.htm#verse16">Ruth&nbsp;1:16</a></span> </p>

<p>33. I have spent the labour of two nights in dictating for you this treatise; and in doing so I have felt a grief as deep as your own. I say in 'dictating' for I have not been able to write it myself. As often as I have taken up my pen  and have tried to fulfil my promise; my fingers have stiffened, my hand has fallen, and my power over it has vanished. The rudeness of the diction, devoid as it is of all elegance or charm, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the feeling of the writer.</p>

<p>34. And now, <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, farewell, and aid with your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the old age of your votary. Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and your works unite you to Christ; thus standing in His presence you will the more readily gain what you ask. In this letter <q>I have built</q> to your memory <q>a monument more lasting than bronze,</q>  which no lapse of time will be able to destroy. And I have cut an inscription on your tomb, which I here subjoin; that, wherever my narrative may go, the reader may learn that you are buried at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> and not uncommemorated there.</p>

<blockquote><p> <em>The Inscription on Paula's Tomb.</em>
<p>Within this tomb a child of Scipio lies,
<br>A daughter of the farfamed Pauline house,
<br>A scion of the Gracchi, of the stock
<br>Of Agamemnon's self, illustrious:
<br>Here rests the lady <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, well-beloved
<br>Of both her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, with <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>
<br>For daughter; she the first of Roman dames
<br>Who hardship chose and <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> for Christ.

<p>In front of the cavern there is another inscription as follows:&mdash;
<br>Do you see here hollowed in the rock a grave,
<br>'Tis <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula's</a> tomb; high heaven has her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.
<br>Who Rome and friends, riches and home forsook
<br>Here in this lonely spot to find her rest.
<br>For here Christ's manger was, and here the kings
<br>To Him, both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, their offerings made.
</p></blockquote>

<p>35. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> fell asleep on the seventh day before the Kalends of February, on the third day of the week, after the sun had set. She was buried on the fifth day before the same Kalends, in the sixth consulship of the Emperor Honorius and the first of Arist&aelig;netus. She lived in the vows of religion five years at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and twenty years at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. The whole duration of her life was fifty-six years eight months and twenty-one days.</p>
