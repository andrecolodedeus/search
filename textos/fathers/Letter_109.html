<h1>Letter 109</h1>

<p> <em>To Eusebius, Bishop of Ancyra.</em> </p>

<p>Many are the devices secretly plotted against me, and through me patched up against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. I am however comforted by the sufferings of the Saints, Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, and men famous in the churches in the word of Grace; and besides these by the promises of our God and Saviour, for in this present life He has promised us nothing pleasant or delightful, but rather trouble, toil, and peril, and attacks of enemies. <q>In the world,</q> He says, <q>you shall have tribulation,</q>  and <q>if they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you,</q>  and <q>If they have called the master of the house <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> how much more shall they call them of his household,</q>  and <q>The time comes when whosoever kills you will think he does God service,</q>  and <q>Straight is the gate and narrow the way which leads unto life,</q>  and <q>When they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you in this city flee you into another,</q>  and I might quote all similar passages. The divine Apostle too speaks in the same strain. <q>Yea and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</q>  These words give me the greatest comfort in this distress. As the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> uttered against me have probably reached your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness's</a> ears, I beseech your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to give no credence to the lies of my slanderers. I am not aware of ever having taught anyone up to the present time to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in two sons. I have been taught to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one only begotten, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> made man. But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the distinction between flesh and Godhead, and regard as impious all who divide our one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> into two sons, as well as those who, travelling in an opposite direction, call the Godhead and manhood of the master Christ one nature. For these exaggerations stand opposed to one another, while between them lies the way of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, beautified by the footprints of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and of all who after them have been conspicuous for the gift of teaching. I was anxious to adduce their opinions, and to point out how they bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in favour of my own, but I want more words than a letter allows room for, wherefore I have written summarily what I have been taught about the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the only begotten; I send my statement to your godly excellency.  I have written not with the object of teaching others, but of making my defence against the accusations brought against me, and of explaining my sentiments to those who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them. After your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has read what I have written, if you find it in conformity with the apostolic doctrines, I hope you will confirm my opinion by what you reply&mdash; if, on the contrary, anything that I have said jars with the divine teaching, I request to be told of it by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. For, though I have spent much time in teaching, I still need one to teach me. <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> says the divine Apostle <q>in part,</q>  and again he says, <q>If any man think that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> anything he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing yet as he ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q>  So I hope that I may hear the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and that you may also give heed to the calm of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and fight for the divine doctrines. It is for their sakes that the very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, making light of the difficulties of the journey, and of the winter, have set out for the imperial city, in the endeavour to bring about some end to the storm. Send them I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, on their way with your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and with your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> too strengthen me. </p>
