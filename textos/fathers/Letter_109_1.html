<h1>Letter 109</h1>

<p><strong>To Riparius</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Riparius, a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Aquitaine had written to inform Jerome that Vigilantius (for whom see Letter LXI.) was preaching in southern <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> against the worship of relics and the keeping of night <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>; and this apparently with the consent of his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Jerome now replies in a letter more noteworthy for its bitterness than for its logic. Nevertheless he offers to write a full confutation of Vigilantius if Riparius will send him the book containing his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. This Riparius subsequently did and then Jerome wrote his treatise <em>Against Vigilantius</em>, the most extreme and least convincing of all his works. The date of the letter is A.D. 404.</span> </p>

<p>1. Now that I have received a letter from you, if I do not answer it I shall be guilty of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and if I do I shall be guilty of rashness. For the matters concerning which you ask my opinion are such that they cannot either be spoken of or listened to without profanity. You tell me that Vigilantius (whose very name <em>Wakeful</em> is a contradiction: he ought rather to be described as <em>Sleepy</em>) has again opened his fetid lips and is pouring forth a torrent of filthy venom upon the relics of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; and that he calls us who cherish them ashmongers and idolaters who pay homage to dead men's bones. Unhappy wretch! To be wept over by all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men, who sees not that in speaking thus he makes himself one with the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritans</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who hold dead bodies unclean and regard as defiled even vessels which have been in the same house with them, following the letter that kills and not the spirit that gives life. <span class="stiki" id="note303018"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:6</a></span> We, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, refuse to worship or adore, I say not the relics of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, but even the sun and moon, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and archangels, the Cherubim and Seraphim and <q>every name that is named, not only in this world but also in that which is to come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303019"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse21">Ephesians&nbsp;1:21</a></span> For we may not serve the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. <span class="stiki" id="note303020"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;1:25</a></span> Still we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the relics of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, that we may adore Him whose <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> they are. We <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the servants that their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> may be reflected upon their Lord who Himself says:&mdash; <q>he that receives you receives me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303021"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;10:40</a></span> I ask Vigilantius, Are the relics of Peter and of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> unclean? Was the body of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> unclean, of which we are told (according to the correct Hebrew text) that it was buried by the Lord Himself? <span class="stiki" id="note303022"><a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;34:6</a></span> And do we, every time that we enter the basilicas of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, pay homage to the shrines of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>? Are the tapers which burn before their tombs only the tokens of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>? I will go farther still and ask a question which will make this theory recoil upon the head of its inventor and which will either kill or cure that frenzied brain of his, so that simple <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> shall be no more subverted by his <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> reasonings. Let him answer me this, Was the Lord's body unclean when it was placed in the sepulchre? And did the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> clothed in white raiment merely watch over a corpse dead and defiled, that ages afterwards this sleepy fellow might indulge in dreams and vomit forth his filthy surfeit, so as, like the persecutor Julian, either to destroy the basilicas of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> or to convert them into <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> temples?</p>

<p>2. I am surprised that the reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>  in whose diocese he is said to be a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> acquiesces in this his mad preaching, and that he does not rather with apostolic rod, nay with a rod of iron, shatter this useless vessel  and deliver him for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved. <span class="stiki" id="note303025"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> He should remember the words that are said: <q>When you saw a thief, then you consented unto him; and hast been partaker with adulterers;</q>  and in another place, <q>I will early destroy all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> of the land; that I may cut off all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doers from the city of the Lord;</q>  and again <q>Do not I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them, O Lord, that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you? And am not I grieved with those that rise up against you? I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them with perfect <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>.</q>  If the relics of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are not worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, how comes it that we read <q>Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>?</q>  If dead men's bones defile those that touch them, how came it that the dead Elisha raised another man also dead, and that life came to this latter from the body of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> which according to Vigilantius must have been unclean? In that case every encampment of the host of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the people of God was unclean; for they carried the bodies of Joseph and of the patriarchs with them in the wilderness, and carried their unclean ashes even into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> land. In that case Joseph, who was a type of our Lord and Saviour, was a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man; for he carried up Jacob's bones with great pomp to Hebron merely to put his unclean father beside his unclean grandfather and great grandfather, that is, one dead body along with others. The wretch's tongue should be cut out, or he should be put under treatment for insanity. As he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to speak, he should learn to be silent. I have myself before now seen the monster, and have done my best to bind the maniac with texts of scripture, as Hippocrates binds his patients with chains; but <q>he went away, he departed, he escaped, he broke out,</q>  and taking refuge between the Adriatic and the Alps of King Cotius  declaimed in his turn against me. For all that a fool says must be regarded as mere noise and mouthing.</p>

<p>3. You may perhaps in your secret thoughts find fault with me for thus assailing a man behind his back. I will frankly admit that my indignation overpowers me; I cannot listen with patience to such <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> opinions. I have read of the javelin of Phinehas, <span class="stiki" id="note303032"><a href="../bible/num025.htm#verse7">Numbers&nbsp;25:7-8</a></span> of the harshness of Elijah, <span class="stiki" id="note303033"><a href="../bible/1ki018.htm#verse40">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;18:40</a></span> of the jealous <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> of Simon the zealot,  of the severity of Peter in putting to death Ananias and Sapphira, <span class="stiki" id="note303035"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;5:1-10</a></span> and of the firmness of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> who, when Elymas the sorcerer withstood the ways of the Lord, doomed him to lifelong blindness. <span class="stiki" id="note303036"><a href="../bible/act013.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;13:8-11</a></span> There is no cruelty in regard for God's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Wherefore also in the Law it is said: <q>If your brother or your friend or the wife of your bosom entice you from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, your hand shall be upon them and you shall shed their blood, <span class="stiki" id="note303037"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse6">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:6-9</a></span> and so shall you put the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> away from the midst of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  Once more I ask, Are the relics of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> unclean? If so, why did the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> allow themselves to walk in that funeral procession before the body&mdash; the unclean body&mdash; of Stephen? Why did they make great lamentation over him, <span class="stiki" id="note303039"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;8:2</a></span> that their grief might be turned into our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>?</p>

<p>You tell me farther that Vigilantius execrates <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>. In this surely he goes contrary to his name. The Wakeful one wishes to sleep and will not hearken to the Saviour's words, <q>What, could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>: the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303040"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;26:40-41</a></span> And in another place a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> sings: <q>At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto you because of your righteous judgments.</q>  We read also in the gospel how the Lord spent whole nights in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> <span class="stiki" id="note303042"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;6:12</a></span> and how the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> when they were shut up in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> kept vigil all night long, singing their psalms until the earth quaked, and the keeper of the <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and the magistrates and citizens were filled with terror. <span class="stiki" id="note303043"><a href="../bible/act016.htm#verse25">Acts&nbsp;16:25-38</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>continue in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and <em>watch</em> in the same,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303044"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse2">Colossians&nbsp;4:2</a></span> and in another place he speaks of himself as <q>in watchings often.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303045"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse27">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:27</a></span> Vigilantius may sleep if he pleases and may choke in his sleep, destroyed by the destroyer of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and of the Egyptians. But let us say with David: <q>Behold, he that keeps <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall neither slumber nor sleep.</q>  So will the Holy One and the Watcher come to us.  And if ever by reason of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> He fall asleep, let us say to Him: <q>Awake, why do you sleep, O Lord;</q>  and when our ship is tossed by the waves let us rouse Him and say, <q>Master, save us: we perish.</q> </p>

<p>4. I would dictate more were it not that the limits of a letter impose upon me a modest silence. I might have gone on, had you sent me the books which contain this man's rhapsodies, for in that case I should have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what points I had to refute. As it is I am only beating the air <span class="stiki" id="note303050"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:26</a></span> and revealing not so much his infidelity&mdash; for this is patent to all&mdash; as my own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But if you wish me to write against him at greater length, send me those wretched dronings of his and in my answer he shall hear an echo of John the Baptist's words <q>Now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees; therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303051"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> </p>
