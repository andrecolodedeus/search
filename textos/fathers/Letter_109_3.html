<h1>Letter 109</h1>

<p> <em>To Julian, Bishop of Cos.</em></p>

<h2>I. He laments over the recent rioting in Palestine.</h2>

<p>Leo, the pope, to Julian, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<p>The information which you give, brother, about the riotous doings of the false <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>  is serious and to no slight degree lamentable; for they are due to the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Eutyches by the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of deceivers is waging against the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the Apostles, though it will end in his own destruction and that of his followers: but this is delayed by the long-suffering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that it may appear how greatly the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> are enslaved to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; because <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> depravity, breaking through its ancient veil of pretence can no longer restrain itself within the limits of its hypocrisy, and has poured forth all its long-concealed poison, raging against the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Truth not only with pen but also with <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> , in order to wrest consent from unlearned simplicity or from panic-stricken <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But the sons of light ought not to be so afraid of the sons of darkness, as being sane to acquiesce in the ideas of madmen or to think that any respect should be shown to men of this kind; for, if they would rather perish than recover their senses, provision must be made lest their escape from punishment should do wider harm, and long toleration of them should lead to the destruction of many.</p>

<h2>II. The ringleaders must be removed to a distance.</h2>

<p>I am not unaware what <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and favour is due to our sons, those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, who forsake not the moderation of their profession, and carry into practice what they promised by their vows. But these insolent disturbers, who boast of their insults and injuries to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> , are to be held not the slaves of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but the soldiers of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, and must be chiefly humiliated in the person of their leaders, who incite the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> mob to uphold their insubordination. And hence, seeing that our most merciful Prince loves the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith with all the devotion of a religious heart, and is greatly offended at the effrontery of these rebel <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as is everywhere reported, we must appeal to his clemency that the instigators of these seditions be removed from their mad congregations; and not only Eutyches and Dioscorus but also any who have been forward in aiding their wrongheaded <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, be placed where they can hold no intercourse with their partners in <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>: for the simpleness of some may chance to be healed by this method, and men will be more easily recalled to soundness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, if they be set free from the incitements of pestilential teachers.</p>

<h2>III. He sends a letter of St. Athanasius to show that the present heresy is only a revival of former exploded heresies.</h2>

<p>But lest the instruction necessary for the confirmation of faithful spirits or the refutation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be wanting or not expressed, I have sent the letter of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Athanasius of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory addressed to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Epictetus , whose testimony Cyril of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory made use of at the Synod of Ephesus against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, because it has so clearly and carefully set forth the Incarnation of the Word, as to overthrow both <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and Eutyches by anticipation in the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of those times. Let the followers of Eutyches and Dioscorus dare to accuse such an authority as this of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, who assert that our preaching goes astray from the teaching and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Fathers. But it ought to avail for the confirmation of the minds of all the Lord's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who, having been already detected and condemned of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in respect of the authorities they followed, now begin more openly to set forth their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> dogma, lest, if their meaning were hid beneath the cloke of silence it might still be doubtful whether the triple <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> , and the mad notion of the Manichees was really revived in them. And as they no longer seek to hide themselves but rise boldly against the churches of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, must we not take care to destroy all the strength of their attempts, observing, as I have said, such discrimination as to separate the incorrigible from the more docile spirits: for <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> conversations corrupt good manners <span class="stiki" id="note360472"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:33</a></span>,</q> and <q>the wise man will be sharper than the pestilent person who is chastised ;</q> in order that in whatever way the society of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is broken up, some vessels may be snatched from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> hand? For we ought not to be so offended at scurrilous and empty words as to have no care for their correction.</p>

<h2>IV. He expresses a hope that Juvenal's timely acknowledgment of error will be imitated by the rest.</h2>

<p>But <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Juvenal, whose injuries are to be lamented, joined himself too rashly to those <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and by embracing Eutyches and Dioscorus, drove many <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> folk headlong by his example, albeit he afterwards corrected himself by wiser counsels. These men, however, who drank in more greedily the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> poison, have become the enemies of him, whose <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> they had been before, so that the very food he had supplied them was turned to his own ruin: and yet it is to be hoped they will imitate him in amending his ways, if only the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> associations of the neighbourhood in which they dwell will help them to recover their senses. But the character of him  who has usurped the place of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> still living cannot be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> from the character of his actions, nor is it to be disputed that he who is loved by the assailants of the Faith must be a misbeliever. Meanwhile, brother, do not hesitate to continue with anxious care to keep me acquainted with the course of events by more frequent letters. Dated November 25th in the consulship of Herculanus (452).</p>
