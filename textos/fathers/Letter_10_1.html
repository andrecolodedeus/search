<h1>Letter 10</h1>

<p> <em>For 338. Coss. Ursus and Polemius; Pr&aelig;f. the same Theodorus, of Heliopolis, and of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a></em>  <em>. After him, for the second year, Philagrius; Indict. xi; Easter-day, vii Kal. Ap.  xxx Phamenoth; Moon 18 1/2; &AElig;ra Dioclet. 54.</em></p>

<p> Although I have travelled all this distance from you, my brethren, I have not forgotten the custom which obtains among you, which has been delivered to us by the fathers , so as to be silent without notifying to you the time of the annual <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> feast, and the day for its celebration. For although I have been hindered by those afflictions of which you have doubtless heard, and severe trials have been laid upon me, and a great distance has separated us; while the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have followed our tracks, laying snares to discover a letter from us, so that by their accusations, they might add to the pain of our wounds; yet the Lord, strengthening and comforting us in our afflictions, we have not feared, even when held fast in the midst of such machinations and conspiracies, to indicate and make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you our saving Easter-feast, even from the ends of the earth. Also when I wrote to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of Alexandria, I urged that these letters might be sent to you through their instrumentality, although  I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> imposed on them by the adversaries. Still, I exhorted them to be mindful of the apostolic boldness of speech, and to say, 'Nothing separates us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ; neither affliction, nor distress, nor <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, nor famine, nor nakedness, nor peril, nor sword <span class="stiki" id="note284207"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;8:35</a></span>.' Thus, keeping the feast myself, I was desirous that you also, my beloved, should keep it; and being conscious that an announcement like this is due from me, I have not delayed to discharge this duty, fearing to be condemned by the Apostolic counsel; 'Render to every man his due. '</p>

<p>2. While I then committed all my affairs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I was anxious to celebrate the feast with you, not taking into account the distance between us. For although place separate us, yet the Lord the Giver of the feast, and Who is Himself our feast , Who is also the Bestower of the Spirit , brings us together in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, in harmony, and in the bond of peace.  For when we mind and think the same things, and offer up the same <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on behalf of each other, no place can separate us, but the Lord gathers and unites us together. For if He promises, that 'when two or three are gathered together in His name, He is in the midst of them <span class="stiki" id="note284212"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;18:20</a></span>,' it is plain that being in the midst of those who in every place are gathered together, He unites them, and receives the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all of them, as if they were near, and listens to all of them, as they cry out the same <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.  I have  borne affliction like this, and all those trials which I mentioned, my brethren, when I wrote to you.</p>

<p>3. And that we may not distress you at all, I would now (only) briefly remind you of these things, because it is not becoming in a man to forget, when more at ease, the pains he experienced in tribulation; lest, like an unthankful and forgetful person, he should be excluded from the divine assembly. For at no time should a man freely praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, more than when he has passed through afflictions; nor, again, should he at any time give thanks more than when he finds rest from toil and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. As Hezekiah, when the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> perished, praised the Lord, and, gave thanks, saying, 'The Lord is my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> ; and I will not cease to bless You with harp all the days of my life, before the house of the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note284216"><a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;38:20</a></span>.' And those valiant and blessed three who were tried in <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, when they were in safety and the fire became to them as dew, gave thanks, praising and 'saying words of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to God. ' I too like them have written, my brethren, having these things in mind; for even in our time, God has made possible those things which are impossible to men. And those things which could not be accomplished by man, the Lord has shown to be easy of accomplishment, by bringing us to you. For He does not give us as a prey to those who seek to swallow us up. For it is not so much us, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and godliness which they planned to overwhelm with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</p>

<p>4. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, multiplied His loving-kindness towards us, not only when He granted the common <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of us all through His Word, but now also, when enemies have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> us, and have sought to seize upon us. As the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> says in a certain place, when describing the incomprehensible riches of Christ: 'But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being rich in mercy, for the great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in follies and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, quickened us with Christ <span class="stiki" id="note284218"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;2:4-5</a></span>.' For the might of man and of all creatures, is weak and poor; but the Might which is above man, and uncreated, is rich and incomprehensible, and has no beginning, but is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. He does not then possess one method only of healing, but being rich, He works in various manners for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by means of His Word, Who is not restricted or hindered in His dealings towards us; but since He is rich and manifold, He varies Himself according to the individual capacity of each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For He is the Word and the Power and the Wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as Solomon testifies concerning Wisdom, that 'being one, it can do all things, and remaining in itself, it makes all things new; and passing upon <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, fashions the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. ' To those then who have not yet attained to the perfect way He becomes like a sheep giving milk, and this was administered by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: 'I have fed you with milk, not with meat <span class="stiki" id="note284220"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span>.' To those who have advanced beyond the full stature of childhood, but still are weak as regards perfection, He is their food, according to their capacity, being again administered by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> , 'Let him that is weak eat herbs.' But as soon as ever a man begins to walk in the perfect way, he is no longer fed with the things before mentioned, but he has the Word for bread, and flesh for food, for it is written, 'Strong meat is for those who are of full age, for those who, by reason of their capacity, have their senses exercised <span class="stiki" id="note284222"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;5:14</a></span>.' And further, when the word is sown it does not yield a uniform produce of fruit in this <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, but one various and rich; for it brings forth, some an hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty , as the Saviour teaches&mdash; that Sower of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and Bestower of the Spirit.  And this is no doubtful matter, nor one that admits no confirmation; but it is in our power to behold the field which is sown by Him; for in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the word is manifold and the produce  rich. Not with <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> alone is such a field adorned; nor with <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> alone, but also with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> matrimony and the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of each one. For in sowing, He did not compel the will beyond the power. Nor is mercy confined to the perfect, but it is sent down also among those who occupy the middle and the third ranks, so that He might rescue all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> generally to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. To this intent He has prepared many mansions <span class="stiki" id="note284226"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;14:2</a></span> with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so that although the dwelling-place is various in proportion to the advance in moral attainment, yet all of us are within the wall, and all of us enter within the same fence, the adversary being cast out, and all his host expelled thence. For apart from light there is darkness, and apart from blessing there is a curse, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> also is apart from the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> far from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> rebukes <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, saying, 'Get behind Me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284227"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;4:10</a></span>.' But us it calls to itself, saying, 'Enter in at the strait gate.' And again, 'Come, blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom which is prepared for you. ' So also the Spirit cried aforetime in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, saying, 'Enter into His gates with psalms. ' For through <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> a man enters in unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> did into the thick cloud where God was. But through <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> a man goes out from the presence of the Lord; as Cain <span class="stiki" id="note284230"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;4:16</a>; <a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse9">Exodus&nbsp;19:9</a></span> when he had slain his brother, went out, as far as his will was concerned, from before the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the Psalmist enters, saying, 'And I will go in to the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even to the God that delights my youth. ' But of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> went out from before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and smote Job  with sore boils. For this is the characteristic of those who go out from before God&mdash; to smite and to injure the men of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is the characteristic of those who fall away from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; to injure and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> on the other hand, take such to themselves and look upon them as friends; as also the blessed David, using openness of speech, says, 'My eyes are on the faithful of the earth, that they may dwell with me.' But those that are weak in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> , <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> urges that we should especially take to ourselves. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is philanthropic , just as in men of an opposite character, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is misanthropic. So Saul, being a sinner, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> David, whereas David, though he had a good opportunity, did not kill Saul. <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> too <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Jacob, while Jacob overcame his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> by meekness. And those eleven sold Joseph, but Joseph, in his loving-kindness, had pity on them.</p>

<p>5. But what need we many words? Our Lord and Saviour, when He was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, wept for their destruction. He was injured, but He threatened  not; not when He was afflicted, not even when He was killed. But He grieved for those who dared to do such things. He, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, suffered for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but they despised and cast from them life, and light, and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. All these were theirs through that Saviour Who suffered in our stead. And verily for their darkness and blindness, He wept. For if they had understood the things which are written in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, they would not have been so vainly daring against the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, the Spirit having said, 'Why do the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rage, and the people <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a vain thing?' And if they had considered the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, they would not have hanged Him Who was their Life.  And if they had examined with their understanding the things which were written, they would not have carefully fulfilled the prophecies which were against themselves, so as for their city to be now desolate, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> taken from them, and they themselves without the law, being no longer called children, but strangers. For thus in the Psalms was it before declared, saying, 'The strange children have acted <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> by Me.' And by Isaiah the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; 'I have begotten and brought up children, and they have rejected Me. ' And they are no longer named the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> nation, but rulers of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>, and people of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>; having exceeded in this even the iniquity of the Sodomites, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> also says, '<a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> is justified before you. ' For the Sodomites raved against <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but these against the Lord and God and King of all, and these dared to slay the Lord of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who was slain by them, lives. But those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who had conspired against the Lord died, having rejoiced a very little in these temporal things, and having fallen away from those which are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. They were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this&mdash; that the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> promise has not respect to temporal enjoyment, but to the hope of those things which are everlasting. For through many tribulations, and labours, and sorrows, the saint enters into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; but when he arrives where sorrow, and distress, and sighing, shall flee away, he shall thenceforward enjoy rest; as Job, who, when tried here, was afterwards the familiar friend of the Lord. But the lover of pleasures, rejoicing for a little while, afterwards passes a sorrowful life; like <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, who had temporal food, but afterwards was condemned thereby.</p>

<p>6. We may take as a type of this distinction, the departure of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and the Egyptians from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. For the Egyptians, rejoicing a little while in their <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> against <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, when they went forth, were all drowned in the deep; but the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, being for a time smitten and injured, by the conduct of the taskmasters, when they came out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, passed through the sea unharmed, and walked in the wilderness as an inhabited place. For although the place was unfrequented by man and desolate, yet, through the gracious gift of the law, and through converse with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, it was no longer desert, but far more than an inhabited country. As also Elisha , when he thought he was alone in the wilderness, was with companies of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; so in this case, though the people were at first afflicted and in the wilderness, yet those who remained faithful afterwards entered the land of promise. In like manner those who suffer temporal afflictions here, finally having endured, attain comfort, while those who here <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> are trodden under foot, and have no good end. For even the rich man <span class="stiki" id="note284240"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;16:19</a></span>, as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> affirms, having indulged in pleasure here for a little while, suffered hunger there, and having drunk largely here, he there thirsted exceedingly. But Lazarus, after being afflicted in worldly things, found rest in heaven, and having hungered for bread ground from grain, he was there satisfied with that which is better than manna, even the Lord who came down and said, 'I am the bread which came down from heaven, and gives life to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284241"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span>.'</p>

<p>7. Oh! My dearly beloved, if we shall gain comfort from afflictions, if rest from labours, if health after sickness, if from death <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, it is not right to be distressed by the temporal ills that lay hold on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. It does not become us to be agitated because of the trials which befall us. It is not right to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> if the gang that contended with Christ, should conspire against godliness; but we should the more please God through these things, and should consider such matters as the probation and exercise of a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> life. For how shall patience be looked for, if there be not previously labours and sorrows? Or how can <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> be tested with no assault from enemies? Or how shall magnanimity be exhibited, unless after contumely and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>? Or how can long-suffering be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, unless there has first been the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> ? And, finally, how can a man behold <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with his eyes, unless the iniquity of the very <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> has previously appeared? Thus even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a> comes before us, when He would show men how to suffer, Who when He was smitten bore it patiently, being reviled He reviled not again, when He suffered He threatened not, but He gave His back to the smiters, and His cheeks to buffetings, and turned not His face from spitting <span class="stiki" id="note284243"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:23</a>; <a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;50:6</a></span>; and at last, was willingly led to death, that we might behold in Him the image of all that is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and that we, conducting ourselves after these examples, might <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> tread on serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy. </p>

<p>8. Thus too <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, while he conducted himself after the example of the Lord, exhorted us, saying, 'Be followers of me, as I also am of Christ <span class="stiki" id="note284245"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:1</a></span>.' In this way he prevailed against all the divisions of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, writing, 'I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284246"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse38">Romans&nbsp;8:38-39</a></span>.' For the enemy draws near to us in afflictions, and trials, and labours, using every endeavour to ruin us. But the man who is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, combating those things that are contrary, and opposing <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> by long-suffering, contumely by meekness, and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, obtains the victory, and exclaims, 'I can do all things through Christ Who strengthens me;' and, 'In all these things we are conquerors through Christ Who loved us. ' This is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Lord, and these are the Lord's means of restoration for the children of men. For He suffered to prepare freedom from suffering for those who suffer in Him, He descended that He might raise us up, He took on Him the trial of being born, that we might <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him Who is unbegotten, He went down to corruption, that corruption might put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, He became weak for us, that we might rise with power, He descended to death, that He might bestow on us <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and give life to the dead. Finally, He became man, that we who die as men might live again, and that death should no more reign over us; for the Apostolic word proclaims, 'Death shall not have the dominion over us. '</p>

<p>9. Now because they did not thus consider these matters, the Ario-maniacs , being opponents of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, smite Him who is their Helper with their tongue, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> Him who set [them] free, and hold all manner of different opinions against the Saviour. Because of His coming down, which was on behalf of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, they have denied His essential Godhead; and seeing that He came forth from the Virgin, they <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> His being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and considering Him as become incarnate in time, they deny His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; and, looking upon Him as having suffered for us, they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him as the incorruptible Son from the incorruptible Father. And finally, because He endured for our sakes, they deny the things which concern His essential <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>; allowing the deed of the unthankful, these despise the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and offer Him insult instead of acknowledging His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. To them may these words justly be addressed: Oh! unthankful opponent of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, altogether <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and the slayer of his Lord, mentally blind, and a Jew in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, had you understood the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and listened to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who said, 'Cause Your face to shine, and we shall be saved.' or again, 'Send out Your light and Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ;'&mdash; then would you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that the Lord did not descend for His own sake, but for ours; and for this reason, you would the more have admired His loving kindness. And had you considered what the Father is, and what the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, you would not have <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as of a mutable nature.  And had you understood His work of loving-kindness towards us, you would not have alienated the Son from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, nor have looked upon Him as a stranger , Who reconciled us to His Father. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these [words] are grievous, not only to those who dispute with Christ , but also to the schismatics; for they are united together, as men of kindred feelings. For they have learned to rend the seamless coat  of God: they think it not strange to divide the indivisible Son from the Father. </p>

<p>10. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed, that when these things are spoken, they will gnash their teeth upon us, with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who stirs them up, since they are troubled by the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> concerning the Redeemer. But the Lord, Who always has scoffed at the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, does the same even now, saying, 'I am in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the Father in Me <span class="stiki" id="note284256"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse11">John&nbsp;14:11</a></span>.' This is the Lord, Who is manifested in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in Whom also the Father is manifested; Who, being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, at last became incarnate for our sakes, that He might offer Himself to the Father in our stead, and redeem us through His oblation and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. This is He Who once brought the people of old time out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; but Who afterwards redeemed all of us, or rather the whole race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, from death, and brought them up from the grave. This is He Who in old time was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> as a lamb, He being signified in the lamb; but Who afterwards was slain for us, for 'Christ our <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Passover</a> is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284257"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span>.' This is He Who delivered us from the snare of the hunters, from the opponents of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I say, and from the schismatics, and again rescued us His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And because we were then victims of deceit, He has now delivered us by His own self.</p>

<p>11. What then is our duty, my brethren, for the sake of these things, but to praise and give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the King of all? And let us first exclaim in the words of the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, 'Blessed be the Lord, Who has not given us over as a prey to their teeth. ' Let us keep the feast in that way which He has dedicated for us unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>&mdash; so that we may celebrate the feast which is in heaven with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Thus anciently, the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when they came out of affliction into a state of ease, kept the feast, staging a song of praise for their victory. So also the people in the time of Esther, because they were delivered from the edict of death, kept a feast to the Lord , reckoning it a feast, returning thanks to the Lord, and praising Him for having changed their condition. Therefore let us, performing our vows to the Lord, and confessing our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, keep the feast to the Lord, in conversation, moral conduct, and manner of life; praising our Lord, Who has chastened us a little, but has not utterly failed nor forsaken us, nor altogether kept silence from us. For if, having brought us out of the deceitful and famous <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> of the opponents of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, He has caused us to pass through many trials and afflictions, as it were in the wilderness, to His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, so that from hence, according to custom, we can send to you, as well as receive letters from you; on this account especially I both give thanks to God myself, and exhort you to thank Him with me and on my behalf, this being the Apostolic custom, which these opponents of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the schismatics, wished to put an end to, and to break off. The Lord did not permit it, but both renewed and preserved that which was ordained by Him through the Apostle, so that we may keep the feast together, and together keep holy-day, according to the tradition and commandment of the fathers.</p>

<p>12. We begin the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">fast of forty days</a> on the nineteenth of the month Mechir (Feb. 13); and the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">holy Easter</a>-fast on the twenty-fourth of the month Phamenoth (March 20). We cease from the fast on the twenty-ninth of the month Phamenoth (March 25), late in the evening of the seventh day. And we thus keep the feast on the first day of the week which dawns on the thirtieth of the month Phamenoth (March 26); from which, to Pentecost, we keep holy-day, through seven weeks, one after the other. For when we have first meditated properly on these things, we shall attain to be counted worthy of those which are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, through Whom to the Father be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Greet one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, remembering us in your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. All the brethren who are with me salute you, at all times remembering you. And I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you may have health in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, my beloved brethren, whom we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> above all.</p>
