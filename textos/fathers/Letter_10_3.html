<h1>Letter 10</h1>

<p><strong>To Paul, an Old Man of Concordia</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Jerome writes to Paul of Concordia, a centenarian (&sect;2), and the owner of a good theological <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> (&sect;3), to lend him some commentaries. In return he sends him his life (newly written) of <a href="../cathen/11590b.htm">Paul the hermit</a>.  The date of the letter is 374 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. The shortness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life is the punishment for man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and the fact that even on the very threshold of the light death constantly overtakes the new-born child proves that the times are continually sinking into deeper depravity. For when the first tiller of paradise had been entangled by the serpent in his snaky coils, and had been forced in consequence to migrate earthwards, although his deathless state was changed for a mortal one, yet the sentence  of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> curse was put off for nine hundred years, or even more, a period so long that it may be called a second <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. Afterwards <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> gradually grew more and more virulent, till the ungodliness of the giants <span class="stiki" id="note300129"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;6:4</a></span> brought in its train the shipwreck of the whole world. Then when the world had been cleansed by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash; if I may so call it&mdash; of the deluge, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life was contracted to a short span. Yet even this we have almost altogether wasted, so continually do our iniquities fight against the divine purposes. For how few there are, either who go beyond their hundredth year, or who, going beyond it, do not regret that they have done so; according to that which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> witnesses in the book of Psalms: <q>the days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labor and sorrow.</q> </p>

<p>2. Why, say you, these opening reflections so remote and so far fetched that one might use against them the Horatian witticism:</p>

<blockquote><p>Back to the eggs which Leda laid for Zeus,
<br>The bard is fain to trace the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of Troy? </p></blockquote>

<p>Simply that I may describe in fitting terms your great age and hoary head as white as Christ's. <span class="stiki" id="note300132"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse14">Revelation&nbsp;1:14</a></span> For see, the hundredth circling year is already passing over you, and yet, always keeping the commandments of the Lord, amid the circumstances of your present life you think over the blessedness of that which is to come. Your eyes are bright and keen, your steps steady, your hearing good, your teeth are white, your voice musical, your flesh firm and full of sap; your ruddy cheeks belie your white hairs, your strength is not that of your age. Advancing years have not, as we too often see them do, impaired the tenacity of your memory; the coldness of your blood has not blunted an <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> at once warm and wary.  Your face is not wrinkled nor your brow furrowed. Lastly, no tremors palsy your hand or <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> it to travel in crooked pathways over the wax on which you write. The Lord shows us in you the bloom of the resurrection that is to be ours; so that whereas in others who die by inches while yet living, we recognize the results of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in your case we ascribe it to righteousness that you still simulate youth at an age to which it is foreign. And although we see the like haleness of body in many even of those who are sinners, in their case it is a grant of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to lead them into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, while in yours it is a gift of God to make you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.</p>

<p>3. Tully in his brilliant speech on behalf of Flaccus  describes the learning of the Greeks as <q>innate frivolity and accomplished vanity.</q></p>

<p>Certainly their ablest literary men used to receive money for pronouncing eulogies upon their kings or princes. Following their example, I set a price upon my praise. Nor must you suppose my demand a small one. You are asked to give me the pearl of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300135"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;13:46</a></span> <q>the words of the Lord,</q> <q>pure words, even as the silver which from the earth is tried, and purified seven times in the fire,</q>  I mean the commentaries of Fortunatian  and&mdash; for its account of the persecutors&mdash; the History of Aurelius Victor,  and with these the Letters of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>;  so that, learning the poison set forth by this schismatic, we may the more gladly drink of the antidote supplied by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian. In the mean time I have sent to you, that is to say, to Paul the aged, a Paul that is older still.  I have taken great pains to bring my language down to the level of the simpler sort. But, somehow or other, though you fill it with water, the jar retains the odor which it acquired when first used.  If my little gift should please you, I have others also in store which (if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shall breathe favorably), shall sail across the sea to you with all kinds of eastern merchandise.</p>
