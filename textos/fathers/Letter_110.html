<h1>Letter 110</h1>

<p> <em>To Domnus, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</em> </p>

<p>When I read your letter I remembered the very blessed Susannah, who when she saw the famous villains, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all was present, uttered that remarkable cry, <q>I am straitened on every side;</q>  but nevertheless preferred to fall into the snares of <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> rather than to despise the just God. And I, sir, have two alternatives as I have often said, to offend God and wound my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, or to fall by man's <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> sentence. The most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor, I think, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of this. For what hindered him from writing, and ordering the ordination to take place, if in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it so pleased him? Why in the world do they utter threats without and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> alarm, and yet do not send letters openly ordering it? One of two things must be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; either the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor is not induced to write, or they are trying to make us break the law and afterwards be indicted by them for illegality. I have before me the example of the blessed Principius,  for in that case, when they had given orders by writing, they punished him for <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. Moreover the letters which I read on the very day of the letter-bearer's arrival are of a contrary tenour. For one of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> has written to some one that he has received letters both from the very illustrious guardsman and the very <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> ex-magister stating that the case of the very godly lord <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> will stand more favourably, and in return for this good will they ask <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on their behalf. I think therefore that a reply ought to be written to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who have written from the imperial city to the effect that  in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the sentence of the very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> both the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and the magnanimity and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the poor and all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of the very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, and in addition to this the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of his opinions, I have ordained him. I am not aware that he has ever objected to apply to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin the title 'Theotokos,' or has ever held any other opinions contrary to the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. As to the question of digamy, I have followed my predecessors; for Alexander of blessed and sacred memory, the ornament of this apostolic see, as well as the very blessed Acacius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ber&oelig;a, ordained Diogenes of blessed memory who was a 'digamus;'  and similarly the blessed Praylius ordained Domninus of C&aelig;sarea who was a 'digamus.'  We have therefore followed precedent, and the example of men well known and illustrious both for learning and character. Proclus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, of blessed memory well aware of this and many other instances, both himself accepted the ordination, and wrote in praise and admiration of it. So too did the leading godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Pontic Diocese,  and all the Palestinians.</p>

<p><q>No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> has been raised about the matter, and we hold it wrong to condemn a man illustrious for many and various noble actions.</q> In my opinion it is becoming to write in these terms. If your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> holds any other view, let what seems good to you be done. I, as they suppose, have undergone one punishment, and am ready by God's help to undergo yet another. Even a third and fourth, if they like, by the stay of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> I will endure, praising the Lord. If your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> thinks right, let us see what answer comes from Palestine, and, after considering more exactly what course is to be taken, let us so write to Constantinople.</p>
