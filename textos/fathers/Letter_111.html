<h1>Letter 111</h1>

<p> <em>To Anatolius the Patrician.</em> </p>

<p>Your excellency will be recompensed for the kindness you have shown me by the God of all, for all that is done for His sake has its reward. I laugh at all my slanderers. The bodies of them who are most severely scourged do not feel the pain, because the scourged flesh is deadened. Still I lament over them whose unrestrained mouths utter such lies. In what way have the accusers of the godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Ibas  been wronged by me that they should utter such <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against me? To begin with, I was not even one of the judges, for in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the imperial decree I was living at Cyrus. Moreover, as I have heard from many, they all along treated my absence as a grievance, for I had arranged for their partaking of the Holy Communion at the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> feast of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,  and as they often expressed a wish to meet me, I received them with kindness and advised them as to the proper course to take. But that I may also speak in the defence of the very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the lord Domnus, what was the proper course for him to take? He was openly attacked; he saw men deposed by a synodical sentence sent into another diocese, and resuming their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions in violation of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; he saw things <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and divine laughed at and turned into ridicule by the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; what was he to do? When he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this he handed over the case to others, and not only to the very godly lord Ibas, but also to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lord <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Symeon of Amida, that the metropolitans of the two provinces might hear the charges. What fairness is there in charging the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with cruelty and kindness? If we excommunicate, we run into danger; if we do not excommunicate, we do not escape it. We alone of all the world are objects of attack. Other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> are at peace. We alone are exposed to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>&mdash;specially I myself, though I took no part in the trial, and am absolutely without responsibility in the matter.</p>

<p>Thus have I been forced to write on reading your lordship's letter, and on learning from it how for these reasons a great commotion has been made against me, a man confined to my diocese; a man of peace; one not even deliberating with the godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province. As a matter of fact, although there have been already two episcopal ordinations in our province, I took part in neither. Were I not restrained by the imperial decree I would have gone away, and spent the remainder of my days in some remote spot. I am faint for the plots hatched against me. I am sure those <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessenes</a> never put together their <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> against me of their own accord. They were prompted to these attacks on me by their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> truthful neighbours. I thank our Saviour that he has deemed me worthy of the beatitudes of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, all unworthy though I be. For this reason I have gladly accepted the sentence of relegation. I am ready for exile, and, for the sake of the <q>hope laid up for me,</q>  welcome whatever <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> they may inflict. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing for your excellency, and beseech all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to share in my petitions.</p>
