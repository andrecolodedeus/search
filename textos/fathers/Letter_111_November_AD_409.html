<h1>Letter 111 (November, A.D. 409)</h1>

<p> <em>To Victorianus, His Beloved Lord and Most Longed-for Brother and Fellow-Presbyter, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. My heart has been filled with great sorrow by your letter. You asked me to discuss certain things at great length in my reply; but such calamities as you narrate claim rather many groans and tears than prolix treatises. The whole world, indeed, is afflicted with such portentous misfortunes, that there is scarcely any place where such things as you describe are not being committed and complained of. A short time ago some brethren were massacred by the barbarians even in those deserts of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in which, in order to perfect security, they had chosen places remote from all disturbance as the sites of their <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>. I suppose, moreover, that the outrages which they have perpetrated in the regions of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you also; and now similar events begin to be announced to us from many provinces of <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, which for long seemed exempt from these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. But why go to a distance for examples? Behold! In our own county of Hippo, which the barbarians have not yet touched, the ravages of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and Circumcelliones make such havoc in our churches, that perhaps the cruelties of barbarians would be light in comparison. For what barbarian could ever have devised what these have done, viz. casting lime and vinegar into the eyes of our clergymen, besides atrociously beating and wounding every part of their bodies? They also sometimes plunder and burn houses, rob granaries, and pour out oil and wine; and by threatening to do this to all others in the district, they compel many even to be re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Only yesterday, tidings came to me of forty-eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> in one place having submitted, under <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of such things, to be rebaptized.</p>

<p>2. These things should make us weep, but not wonder; and we ought to cry unto God that not for our merit, but according to His mercy, He may deliver us from so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For what else was to be expected by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, seeing that these things were so long ago foretold both by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>? We ought not, therefore, to be so inconsistent as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these Scriptures when they are read by us, and to complain when they are fulfilled; rather, surely, ought even those who had refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> when they read or heard these things in Scripture to become <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> now when they behold the word fulfilled; so that under this great pressure, as it were, in the olive-press of the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although there be the dregs of unbelieving murmurs and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, there is also a steady out flowing of pure oil in the confessions and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>. For unto those men who incessantly reproach the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, impiously saying that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> did not suffer such grievous calamities before the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine was promulgated throughout the world, it is easy to find a reply in the Lord's own words in the gospel, <q>That servant which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not his lord's will, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes; but the servant which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112383"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;12:47-48</a></span> What is there to excite surprise, if, in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> dispensation, the world, like that servant, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, and refusing to do it, is beaten with many stripes? These men remark the rapidity with which the gospel is proclaimed: they do not remark the perversity with which by many it is despised. But the meek and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who have to bear a double portion of temporal calamities, since they suffer both at the hands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men and along with them, have also consolations peculiarly their own, and the hope of the world to come; for which reason the apostle says, <q>The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall hereafter be revealed in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112384"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;8:18</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Wherefore, my beloved, even when you meet those whose words you say you cannot bear, because they say, <q>If we have deserved these things for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, how comes it that the servants of God are cut off not less than ourselves by the sword of the barbarians, and the handmaids of God are led away into captivity?</q>&mdash; answer them humbly, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, and piously in such words as these: However carefully we keep the way of righteousness, and yield <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to our Lord, can we be better than those three men who were cast into the fiery furnace for keeping the law of God? And yet, read what Azarias, one of those three, said, opening his lips in the midst of the fire: <q>Blessed are You, O Lord God of our fathers: Your name is worthy to be praised and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> for evermore; for You are righteous in all the things that You have done to us; yea, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> are all Your works: Your ways are right, and all Your judgments <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In all the things which You have brought upon us, and upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, You have executed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment; for according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and judgment You brought all these things upon us because of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and committed iniquity, departing from You. In all things have we trespassed, and not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> Your commandments, nor kept them, neither done as You have commanded us, that it might go well with us. Wherefore all that You have brought upon us, and everything that You have done to us, You have done in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment. And You delivered us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> king, and the most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in all the world. And now we cannot open our mouths: we have become a shame and reproach to Your servants, and to them that worship You. Yet deliver us not up wholly, for Your name's sake, neither disannul Your covenant; and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not Your mercy to depart from us, for Your beloved <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> sake, for Your servant Isaac's sake, and for Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> sake, to whom You have spoken, and promised that You would multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lies upon the sea-shore. For we, O Lord, have become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  Here, my brother, you may surely see how men such as they, men of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, men of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in the midst of tribulation&mdash;from which, however, they were delivered, the flame itself fearing to consume them, were not silent about their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but confessed them, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that because of these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> they were deservedly and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> brought low.</p>

<p>4. Nay, can we be better men than Daniel himself, concerning whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, speaking to the prince of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, says by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel, <q>Are you wiser than Daniel?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112386"><a href="../bible/eze028.htm#verse3">Ezekiel&nbsp;28:3</a></span> who also is placed among the three righteous men to whom alone God says that He would grant deliverance&mdash;pointing, doubtless, in them to three representative righteous men,&mdash; declaring that he would deliver only <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, Daniel, and Job, and that they should save along with themselves neither son nor daughter, but only their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>?  Nevertheless, read also the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Daniel, and see how, when in captivity, he confesses not only the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his people, but his own also, and acknowledges that because of these the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of God has visited them with the punishment of captivity and with reproach. For it is thus written: <q>And I set my face unto the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, to seek by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplications, with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and sackcloth, and ashes: and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> unto the Lord my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and made my confession, and said: O Lord, the great and dreadful <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him, and to them that keep His commandments; we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from Your precepts and from Your judgments: neither have we hearkened unto Your servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, which spoke in Your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land. O Lord, righteousness belongs unto You, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither You have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against You. O Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against You. To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though we have rebelled against Him; neither have we <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the voice of the Lord, to walk in His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which He set before us by His servants the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Yea, all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> have transgressed Your law, even by departing, that they might not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Your voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a> the servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against them. And He has confirmed His words which He spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done upon Jerusalem. As it is written in the <a href="../cathen/10582c.htm">law of Moses</a>, all this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> has come upon us: yet made we not our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that we might turn from our iniquities and understand Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Therefore has the Lord watched upon the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and brought it upon us; for the Lord our God is righteous in all His works which He does; for we <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> not His voice. And now, O Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that hast brought Your people forth out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> with a mighty hand, and hast gotten You renown as at this day; we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, we have done wickedly. O Lord, according to all Your righteousness, I beseech You, let Your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and Your fury be turned away from Your city Jerusalem, Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain, because, for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Your people have become a reproach to all that are about us. Now, therefore, O our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hear the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Your servant, and His supplications, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Your face to shine upon Your sanctuary which is desolate, for the Lord's sake. O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, incline Your ear, and hear; open Your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by Your name; for we do not present our supplications before You for our righteousnesses, but for Your great mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do: defer not, for Your own sake, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for Your city and Your people are called by Your name. And while I was speaking, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, and confessing my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of my people...</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112388"><a href="../bible/dan009.htm#verse3">Daniel&nbsp;9:3-20</a></span> Observe how he spoke first of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and then of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his people. And he extols the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and gives praise to God for this, that He visits even His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> with the rod, not <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>, but because of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. If, therefore, this be the language of men who by reason of their eminent <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> found even encompassing flames and lions harmless, what language would befit men standing on a level so low as we occupy, seeing that, whatever righteousness we may seem to practise, we are very far from being worthy of comparison with them?</p>

<p>5. Lest, however, any one should think that those servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose death at the hand of barbarians you relate, ought to have been delivered from them in the same manner as the three young men were delivered from the fire, and Daniel from the lions, let such an one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were performed in order that the kings by whom they were delivered to these punishments might <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they worshipped the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. For in His hidden counsel and mercy God was in this manner making provision for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of these kings. It pleased Him, however, to make no such provision in the case of Antiochus the king, who cruelly put the Maccabees to death; but He punished the heart of the obdurate king with sharper severity through their most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> sufferings. Yet read what was said by even one of them&mdash; the sixth who suffered: <q>After him they brought also the sixth, who, being ready to die, said, 'Be not deceived without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>; for we suffer these things for ourselves, having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against God: therefore marvellous things are done unto us; but think not you that takest in hand to strive against God and His law that you shall escape unpunished.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112389"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;7:18-19</a></span> You see how these also are wise in the exercise of humility and sincerity, confessing that they are chastened because of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> by the Lord, of whom it is written: <q>Whom the Lord loves He corrects,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112390"><a href="../bible/pro003.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;3:12</a></span> and <q>He scourges every son whom He receives;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112391"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6</a></span> wherefore the Apostle says also, <q>If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged; but when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112392"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:31-32</a></span> </p>

<p>6. These things read faithfully, and proclaim faithfully; and to the utmost of your power beware, and teach others that they must beware, of murmuring against God in these trials and tribulations. You tell me that good, faithful, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> servants of God have been cut off by the sword of the barbarians. But what matters it whether it is by sickness or by sword that they have been set free from the body? The Lord is careful as to the character with which His servants go from this world&mdash; not as to the mere circumstances of their departure, excepting this, that lingering weakness involves more suffering than a sudden death; and yet we read of this same protracted and dreadful weakness as the lot of that Job to whose righteousness God Himself, who cannot be deceived, bears such testimony.</p>

<p>7. Most calamitous, and much to be bewailed, is the captivity of chaste and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; but their God is not in the power of their captors, nor does He forsake those captives whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> indeed to be His own. For those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, the record of whose sufferings and confessions I have quoted from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, being held in captivity by enemies who had carried  them away, uttered those words, which, preserved in writing, we can read for ourselves, in order to make us understand that servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even when they are in captivity, are not forsaken by their Lord. Nay, more, do we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what wonders of power and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the almighty and merciful God may please to accomplish by means of these captive <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> even in the land of the barbarians? Be that as it may, cease not to intercede with groanings on their behalf before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to seek, so far as your power and His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> permits you, to do for them whetever can be done, and to give them whatever consolation can be given, as time and opportunity may be granted. A few years ago, a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>, a grand-daughter of Bishop Severus, was carried off by barbarians from the neighbourhood of Sitifa, and was by the marvellous mercy of God restored with great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. For at the very time when the maiden entered the house of her barbarian captors, it became the scene of much distress through the sudden illness of its owners, all the barbarians&mdash; three brothers, if I mistake not, or more&mdash; being attacked with most dangerous disease. Their mother observed that the maiden was dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that by her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> her sons might be delivered from the danger of death, which was imminent. She begged her to intercede for them, promising that if they were healed she should be restored to her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. She fasted and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and straightway was heard; for, as the result showed, the event had been appointed that this might take place. They therefore, having recovered health by this unexpected favour from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, regarded her with admiration and respect, and fulfilled the promise which their mother had made.</p>

<p>8. Pray, therefore, to God for them, and beseech Him to enable them to say such things as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Azariah, whom we have mentioned, poured forth along with other expressions in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and confession before God. For in the land of their captivity these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are in circumstances similar to those of the three Hebrew youths in that land in which they could not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the Lord their God in the manner prescribed: they cannot either bring an oblation to the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or find a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by whom their oblation may be presented to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. May God therefore grant them <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to say to Him what Azariah said in the following sentences of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: <q>Neither is there at this time prince, or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or leader, or burnt-offering, or <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, or oblation, or <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, or place to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> before You, and to find mercy: nevertheless, in a contrite heart and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> spirit let us be accepted. Like as in the burnt-offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs, so let our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> be in Your sight this day. And grant that we may wholly go after You; for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in You. And now we follow You with all our heart: we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> You and seek Your face. Put us not to shame, but deal with us after Your loving-kindness, and according to the multitude of Your mercies. Deliver us also according to Your marvellous works, and give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to Your name, O Lord; and let all them that do Your servants hurt be ashamed: and let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken: and let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You are Lord, the only <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> over the whole world.</q> </p>

<p>9. When His servants use these words, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> fervently to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He will stand by them, as He has been wont ever to stand by His own, and will either not permit their chaste bodies to suffer any wrong from the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of their enemies, or if He permit this, He will not lay <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their charge in the matter. For when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not defiled by any impurity of consent to such wrong, the body also is thereby protected from all participation in the guilt; and in so far as nothing was committed or permitted by <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> on the part of her who suffers, the whole blame lies with him who did the wrong, and all the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> done to the sufferer will be regarded not as implying the baseness of wanton compliance, but as a wound blamelessly endured. For such is the worth of unblemished purity in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that while it remains intact, the body also retains its purity unsullied, even although by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> its members may be overpowered.</p>

<p>I beg your Charity to be satisfied with this letter, which is very long considering my other work (although too short to meet your wishes), and is somewhat hurriedly written, because the bearer is in haste to be gone. The Lord will furnish you with much more abundant consolation if you read attentively His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> word.</p>
