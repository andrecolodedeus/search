<h1>Letter 112</h1>

<p> <em>To Domnus, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</em> </p>

<p>When news was brought to me that the pettiness of the victorious emperor had been put an end to, a reconciliation effected between him and the very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>,  the summons to the council cancelled, and the peace of the churches restored, I hoped that our troubles were a thing of the past. But I am deeply distressed at what I hear from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. It is impossible to hope for any good from this notorious council, unless the merciful Master with His wonted <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> shall undo the riotous <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons'</a> devices. Even in the great synod, I mean that of Nic&aelig;a, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> party voted with the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and set their hands to the apostolic exposition. But they did not cease to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> till they had torn asunder the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For thirty years the supporters of the apostolic doctrines and they who were infected with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> continued in communion with one another. But at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>,  when the latest council was finished, when they had seated the man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the great Meletius, on the apostolic throne, and then after a few days ejected him by the imperial authority, Euzoius who was affected with the undoubted plague of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> was put forward, and straightway the champions of apostolic doctrines seceded and thereafter the division continued.</p>

<p>As I look back on what happened then, and look forward to similar events in the future, my wretched spirit sighs and wails, for I see no prospect of good. The men of the other <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the poison which lies in the Twelve Chapters;  having regard to the celebrity of the writer of them, they suspect no mischief, and his successor in the see  is I think adopting every means to confirm them in a second synod. For supposing he who lately wrote them at command, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> all who did not wish to abide by them, were presiding over an &oelig;cumenical council, what could he not effect? And be well assured, my lord, that no one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> they contain will brook to accept them, though twice as many men of this sort decree them. Before now, though a larger number have rashly confirmed them, I resisted at Ephesus, and refused to communicate with the writer of them till he had agreed to the points laid down by me, and had harmonized his teaching with them, without making any mention of the Chapters. This your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> can ascertain without any difficulty if you order the acts of the synod to be investigated; for they are preserved as is customary with the synodical signatures, and there are extant more than fifty synodic acts showing the accusation of the Twelve Chapters. For before the journey to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> the blessed John  had written to the very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Eutherius of Tyana, Firmus of C&aelig;sarea, and Theodotus of Ancyra, denouncing these Chapters as <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a>.  And at Ephesus the exposition and confirmation of these Chapters was the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our deposition of the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> and of the Ephesian.  Moreover at Ephesus many synodic letters were written both to the victorious emperor, and to the great officers, about these Chapters; and in like manner to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> at Constantinople and to the reverend <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Moreover when we were summoned to Constantinople we had five discussions in the imperial presence, and afterwards sent the emperor three protestations. And to the very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the West, of Milan I mean, of Aquileia, and of Ravenna, we wrote on the same subject, protesting that the Chapters were full of the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> novelty. Furthermore their writer received a letter from the blessed John by the hands of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>,  openly blaming them; and in like manner from Acacius of blessed memory. And to give your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> concise information on the subject I have sent you both the letter of the blessed Acacius, as well as that of the blessed John to the blessed Cyril, in order that you may perceive that though they were writing to him on the subject of agreement they blamed these Chapters. And the blessed Cyril himself, in his letter to the blessed Acacius plainly indicated the drift of these Chapters in the words <q>I have written this against his innovations and when peace is made they will be made manifest.</q> The very defence proves the accusation. I have sent you the copy of what he wrote at the time of the agreement, that you may see, my lord, that he made no mention of them, and that those who attend the Council are under an obligation to bring forward what was written at the time of the agreement, and to state plainly what had caused the difference and on what terms the sundered parts were atoned. For they who are summoned to fight for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must flinch from no toil, and must invoke the divine aid, that we may preserve unimpaired the heritage bequeathed us by our forefathers.</p>

<p>Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> must look out for men of like mind among the godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and make them companions of your journey; and likewise of the reverend <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> those who are <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, lest betrayed even by them of our own side we are either driven to do something displeasing to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, or, in our abandonment, fall an easy prey to our foes.</p>

<p>It is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in which we have our hopes of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and we must leave no means untried to prevent anything spurious being brought into it, and the apostolic teaching from being corrupted.</p>

<p>I write you these words from far away, with sighs and with groans, and I beseech our common Master to scatter this dark cloud and bestow on us once more the boon of the bright sunshine.</p>
