<h1>Letter 113</h1>

<p> <em>To Leo, Bishop of Rome. </em></p>

<p>If <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the herald of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the trumpet of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, hastened to the great Peter  in order that he might carry from him the desired solution of difficulties to those at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> who were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about living in conformity with the law, much more do we, men insignificant and small, hasten to your apostolic see  in order to receive from you a cure for the wounds of the churches. For every reason it is fitting for you to hold the first place, inasmuch as your see is adorned with many privileges. Other cities are indeed adorned by their size, their beauty, and their population; and some which in these respects are lacking are made bright by certain spiritual boons. But on your city the great Provider has bestowed an abundance of good gifts. She is the largest, the most splendid, the most illustrious of the world, and overflows with the multitude of her inhabitants. Besides all this, she has achieved her present sovereignty, and has given her name to her subjects. She is moreover specially adorned by her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in due testimony whereof the divine Apostle exclaims <q>your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is spoken of throughout the whole world.</q>  And if even after receiving the seeds of the message of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> her boughs were straightway heavy with these admirable fruits, what words can fitly praise the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> now practised in her? In her keeping too are the tombs that give light to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the faithful, those of our common fathers and teachers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.  This thrice blessed and divine pair arose in the region of sunrise, and spread their rays in all directions. Now from the region of sunset, where they willingly welcomed the setting of this life, they illuminate the world. They have rendered your see most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>; this is the crown and completion  of your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things; but in these days their God has adorned their throne  by setting on it your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, emitting, as you do, the rays of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Of this I might give many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, but it is enough to mention the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> lately showed against the ill-famed Manichees, proving thereby your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety's</a> earnest regard for divine things. Your recent writings, too, are enough to indicate your apostolic character. For we have met with what your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has written concerning the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>  of our God and Saviour, and we have marvelled at the exactness of your expressions.</p>

<p>For both writings agreed in setting forth both the everlasting Godhead of the Only-begotten derived from the everlasting Father, and the manhood derived from the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David; and that the nature assumed was in all things like us, being unlike to us in this respect alone, that it remained free from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; since it springs not of nature but of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>.</p>

<p>The letters moreover contain this, that the Only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is one, and his Godhead impassible, immutable, and invariable, like the Father who begot Him and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; and that on this account He took the passible nature, divine nature being incapable of suffering, that by the suffering of His own flesh He might bestow freedom from suffering on them that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him. These statements and others of like nature were contained in your letters. We, in admiration of your spiritual wisdom, have lauded the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> uttered through you, and we invoke and beseech and beg and implore your highness to protect the churches of God that are now assailed by the storm.</p>

<p>We had expected that through the instrumentality of the representatives  sent by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, the tempest would have been done away, but we have fallen under severer attacks of the storm. For the very righteous <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria was not content with the illegal and very unrighteous deposition of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, the lord Flavianus, nor was his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> satisfied with a similar slaughter of the rest of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but me too in my absence he stabbed with a pen, without summoning me to the bar, without trying me in my presence, without questioning me as to my opinions about the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of our God and Saviour. Even murderers, tomb-breakers, and adulterers, are not condemned by their judges until they have themselves confirmed by confession the charges brought against them, or have been clearly convicted by the testimony of others. Yet I, nurtured as I have been in the divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, have been condemned by him at his pleasure, when all the while I was five and thirty days' march away.</p>

<p>Nor is this all that he has done. Only last year when two fellows tainted with the unsoundness of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> had gone there and patched up <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> against me, he stood up in church and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> me, and that after I had written to him and explained my opinions to him.</p>

<p>I lament the disturbance of the church, and long for peace. Six and twenty years have I ruled the church entrusted to me by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, aided by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Never in the time of the blessed Theodotus,  the chief <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the East; never in the time of his successors in the see of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, did I incur the slightest blame. By the help of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> working with me more than a thousand <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> did I rescue from the plague of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>; many others from the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> and Eunomian factions did I bring over to our Master Christ. I have done pastoral duty in eight hundred churches, for so many parishes does Cyrus contain; and in them, through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, not even one tare is left, and our flock is delivered from all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. He who sees all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how many stones have been cast at me by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, how many conflicts in most of the cities of the East I have waged against <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, against <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, against every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. After all this trial and all this danger I have been condemned without a trial.</p>

<p>But I await the sentence of your apostolic see. I beseech and implore your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to succour me in my appeal to your fair and righteous tribunal. Bid me hasten to you, and prove to you that my teaching follows the footprints of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. I have in my possession what I wrote twenty years ago; what I wrote eighteen, fifteen, twelve, years ago; against <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and Eunomians, against <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>; against the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>; on <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">divine Providence</a>; on theology; and on the divine <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>. By God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> I have interpreted the writings of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and the oracles of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. From these it is not difficult to ascertain whether I have adhered to the right rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or have swerved from its straight course. Do not, I implore you, spurn my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; regard, I implore you, the insults piled after all my labours on my poor grey head.</p>

<p>Above all, I implore you to tell me whether I ought to put up with this unrighteous deposition or not; for I await your decision. If you bid me abide by the sentence of condemnation, I abide; and henceforth I will trouble no man, and will wait for the righteous tribunal of our God and Saviour. God is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, my lord, that I care not for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. I care only for the scandal that has been caused, in that many of the simpler folk, and especially those whom I have rescued from various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, cleaving to the authority of my judges and quite unable to understand the exact <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the doctrine, will perhaps suppose me guilty of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>All the people of the East <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that during all the time of my <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> I have not acquired a house, not a piece of ground, not an obol, not a tomb, but of my own accord have embraced poverty, after distributing, at the death of my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, the whole of the property which I inherited from them.</p>

<p>Above all I implore you, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sir, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to grant me the help of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. I have told you this by the reverend and godly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> Hypatius and Abramius <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>  and by Alypius exarch  of our <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. I would hasten to you myself were I not kept back by the chains of the imperial order, which imprison me as they do others. Treat my messengers, I beseech you, as a father might his sons; give them kindly and unbiassed audience; deign to grant your protection to my old age,  <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> as it is and attacked in vain. Above all, regard, to the utmost of your power, the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> conspired against; preserve for the churches the inheritance of their fathers unimpaired.  So will your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> receive the recompense due for such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> from the great Giver of all good gifts. </p>
