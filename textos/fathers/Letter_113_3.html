<h1>Letter 113</h1>

<p> <em>To Julian, Bishop of Cos.</em></p>

<h2>I. After thanks for Julian's sympathy he complains of the deposition of Aetius from the archdeaconry.</h2>

<p>Leo, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, to Julian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Cos.</p>

<p>I acknowledge in your letter, beloved, the feelings of brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in that you sympathize with us in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> grief at the many grievous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> we have borne. But we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that these things which the Lord has either allowed or wished us to suffer, may avail to the correction of those who live through them , and that adversities may cease through the cessation of offenses. Both which results will follow through the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if only He remove the scourge and turn the hearts of His people to Himself. But as you, brother, are saddened by the hostilities which have raged around us, so I am made anxious because, as your letter indicates, the treacherous attacks of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are not set at rest in the church of Constantinople, and men seek occasion to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> those who have been the defenders of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith. For so long as Aetius is removed from his office of archdeacon under pretence of promotion  and Andrew is taken into his place, who had been cast off for associating with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; so long as respect is shown to the accusers of Flavian of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, and the partners or <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of that most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> confessor are put down, it is only too clearly shown what pleases the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church itself. Towards whom I put off taking action till I hear the merits of the case and await his own dealing with me in the letter our son Aetius tells me he will send, giving opportunity for <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> correction, whereby I desire my vexation to be appeased. Nevertheless, I have written to our most clement Prince and the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Augusta about these things which concern the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> they will in the devoutness of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> take heed lest a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> already condemned should succeed in springing up again to the detriment of their own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> work.</p>

<h2>II. He asks Julian to act for him as Anatolius is deficient in vigour.</h2>

<p>See then, beloved brother, that you bestow the necessary thought on the cares of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, which by her rights as your mother commends to you, who were nourished at her breast, the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Truth against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorians</a> and Eutychians, in order that, supported by the Divine help, you may not cease to watch the interests of the city of Constantinople, lest at any time the storms of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> arise within her. And because the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Princes is so great that you may confidently suggest what is necessary to them, use their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> for the benefit of the universal Church. But if ever you consult me, beloved, on things which you think doubtful, my reply shall not fail to supply instruction, so that, apart from cases which ought to be decided by the inquiries of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of each particular church, you may act as my legate and undertake the special charge of preventing the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> or Eutychian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> reviving in any quarter; because the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople does not possess <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> vigour, and is not very jealous either for the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> or for his own <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>: whereas if he had any spiritual activity, he ought to have considered by whom he was ordained, and whom he succeeded in such a way as to follow the blessed Flavian rather than the instruments of his promotion. And, therefore, when our most religious Princes deign in accordance with my entreaties to reprimand our brother Anatolius on those matters, which deservedly come under blame, join your diligence to theirs, beloved, that all causes of offenses may be removed by the application of the fullest correction and he cease from injuring our son Aetius. For with a Catholic-minded <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> even though there was something which seemed calculated to annoy in his archdeacon, it ought to have been passed over from regard for the Faith, rather than that the most worthless <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> should take the place of a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. And so when I have learned the rest of the story, I shall then more clearly gather what ought to be done. For, meanwhile, I have thought better to restrain my vexation and to exercise patience that there might be room for forgiveness.</p>

<h2>III. He asks for further information about the rioting in Palestine and in Egypt.</h2>

<p>But with regard to the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Palestine, who are said this long time to be in a state of mutiny, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not by what spirit they are at present moved. Nor has any one yet explained to me what reasons they seem to bring forward for their discontent: whether for instance, they wish to serve the Eutychian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by such <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, or whether they are irreconcilably vexed that their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could have been misled into that <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, whereby, in spite of the very associations of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spots, from which issued instruction for the whole world, he has alienated himself from the Truth of the Lord's Incarnation, and in their opinion that cannot be venial in him which in others had to be wiped out by absolution. And therefore I desire to be more fully informed about these things that proper means may be taken for their correction; because it is one thing to arm oneself wickedly against the Faith, and another thing to be immoderately disturbed on behalf of it. You must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, too, that the documents which Aetius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> told me before had been dispatched, and the epitome of the Faith which you say you have sent, have not yet arrived. Hence, if an opportunity offers itself of a more expeditious messenger, I shall be glad for any information that may seem expedient to be sent me as soon as possible. I am anxious to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> , whether they have regained their peacefulness and their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and about the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a>, what trustworthy tidings reaches you: I wish you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I wrote to its <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or his ordainers, or the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and have therefore sent you a copy of the letter. You will learn also what I have said to our most clement Prince and our most religious Empress from the copies sent.</p>

<h2>IV. He asks for a Latin translation of the acts of Chalcedon.</h2>

<p>I wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether my letter  has been delivered to you, brother, which I sent you by Basil the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, upon the Faith of the Lord's Incarnation, while Flavian of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory was still alive; for I fancy you have never made any comment on its contents. We have no very clear information about the acts of the Synod, which were drawn up at the time of the council at Chalcedon, on account of the difference of language.  And therefore I specially enjoin upon you, brother, that you have the whole collected into one volume, accurately translated of course into Latin, that we may not be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> on any portion of the proceedings, and that there may be no manner of uncertainty after you have taken pains to bring it fully within my understanding. Dated March 11th, in the consulship of the illustrious Opilio (453).</p>
