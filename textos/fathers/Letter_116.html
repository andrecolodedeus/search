<h1>Letter 116</h1>

<p> <em>the Presbyter Renatus.</em></p>

<p>We have heard of the warm and righteous <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the just and lawful boldness of speech which you employed in condemning the audacious proceedings at Ephesus. Nor is this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us alone, but the fame of your <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> has gone out into all lands, and all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are celebrating your righteousness, your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, your boldness, and your denunciation of my unfair treatment. And your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> took this course after seeing one massacre. If you had seen the others which took place after your departure you would perhaps have emulated the fervour of the famous Phinehas.  I am one of those who was subsequently condemned, being forbidden by the imperial order to attend the council, and sentenced in my absence. </p>

<p>Six and twenty years have I been a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; innumerable labours have I undergone; I have struggled hard for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; I have freed tens of thousands of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> from their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and brought them to the Saviour; and now they have stripped me of my <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; they are exiling me from the city. For my old age, for my hairs grown gray in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they have no respect. Wherefore, I beseech your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, persuade the very sacred and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a>  to bid me hasten to your council. For that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> see has precedence over all churches in the world, for many reasons; and above all for this, that it is free from all taint of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and that no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of heterodox opinion has ever sat upon its throne, but it has kept the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> undefiled.  Confident in your <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> I shall accept your decisions, whatever they may be, and shall claim to be judged by my writings. More than thirty books have I written against <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius, against <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, against Macedonius, against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and against <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; I have interpreted the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, and any one who likes may easily learn that I have followed in the steps of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, proclaiming the one Son, one Father, and one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; one Godhead of the Trinity, one sovereignty, one power, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, immutability, impassibility, one will;  that the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> was perfect, perfect the manhood taken for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and for our sakes delivered unto death. I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> and another <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, but one and the same, <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and God begotten of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, through the form of the servant, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David. These and like doctrines I continue to teach; these also I have found in the writings of the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and sacred lord <a href="../cathen/01691a.htm">archbishop</a> Leo, and I praise the Lord of all that I agree with his apostolic doctrines. Receive, I beseech you, my supplication, and do not overlook the wrongs under which I suffer. On this account I have sent to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> the godly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> Hypatius and Abramius, <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a>, and Alypius exarch of our <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, adorned as they are by good lives, and able by word of mouth to give you exact information as to the affairs of my insignificant self.</p>
