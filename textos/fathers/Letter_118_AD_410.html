<h1>Letter 118 (A.D. 410)</h1>

<p> <em>Augustine to Dioscorus.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. You have sent suddenly upon me a countless multitude of questions, by which you must have purposed to blockade me on every side, or rather bury me completely, even if you were under the impression that I was otherwise unoccupied and at leisure; for how could I, even though wholly at leisure, furnish the solution of so many questions to one in such haste as you are, and, in fact, as you write, on the eve of a journey? I would, indeed, be prevented by the mere number of the questions to be resolved, even if their solution were easy. But they are so perplexingly intricate, and so hard, that even if they were few in number, and engaging me when otherwise wholly at leisure, they would, by the mere time required, exhaust my powers of application, and wear out my strength. I would, however, fain snatch you forcibly away from the midst of those inquiries in which you so much delight, and fix you down among the cares which engage my attention, in order that you may either learn not to be unprofitably curious, or desist from presuming to impose the task of feeding and fostering your curiosity upon men among whose cares one of the greatest is to repress and curb those who are too inquisitive. For if time and pains are devoted to writing anything to you, how much better and more profitably are these employed in endeavours to cut off those vain and treacherous <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> (which are to be guarded against with a caution proportioned to the ease with which they impose upon us, by their being disguised and cloaked under the semblance of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and the name of liberal studies), rather than in causing them to be, by our service, or rather obsequiousness, so to speak, roused to a more vehement assertion of the despotism under which they so oppress your excellent spirit.</p>

<p>2. For tell me what good purpose is served by the many Dialogues which you have read, if they have in no way helped you towards the discovery and attainment of the end of all your actions? For by your letter you indicate plainly enough what you have proposed to yourself as the end to be attained by all this most ardent study of yours, which is at once useless to yourself and troublesome to me. For when you were in your letter using every means to persuade me to answer the questions which you sent, you wrote these words: <q>I might importune you at greater length, and through many of your dear friends; but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your disposition, that you do not desire to be solicited, but show kindness readily to all, if only there be nothing improper in the thing requested: and there is absolutely nothing improper in what I ask. Be this, however, as it may, I beg you to do me this kindness, for I am on the point of embarking on a voyage.</q> In these words of your letter you are indeed right in your opinion as to myself, that I am desirous of showing kindness to all, if only there be nothing improper in the request made; but it is not my opinion that there is nothing improper in what you ask. For when I consider how a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is distracted and overwrought by the cares of his office clamouring on every side, it does not seem to me proper for him suddenly, as if deaf, to withdraw himself from all these, and devote himself to the work of expounding to a single student some unimportant questions in the Dialogues of Cicero. The impropriety of this you yourself apprehend, although, carried away with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the pursuit of your studies, you will by no means give heed to it. For what other construction can I put on the fact that, after saying that in this matter there is absolutely nothing improper, you have immediately subjoined: <q>Be this, however, as it may, I beg you to do me this kindness, for I am on the point of embarking on a voyage</q>? For this intimates that in your view, at least, there is no impropriety in your request, but that whatever impropriety  may be in it, you nevertheless ask me to do what you ask, because you are about to go on a voyage. Now what is the force of this supplementary plea&mdash; <q>I am on the point of embarking on a voyage</q>? Do you mean that, unless you were in these circumstances, I ought not to do you service in which anything improper may be involved? You think, forsooth, that the impropriety can be washed away by <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> water. But even were it so, my share at least of the fault would remain unexpiated, because I do not propose undertaking a voyage.</p>

<p>3. You write, further, that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how very painful it is to you to be burdensome to any one, and you solemnly protest that God alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how irresistible is the necessity under which you make the application. When I came to this statement in your letter, I turned my attention eagerly to learn the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the necessity; and, behold, you bring it before me in these words: <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the ways of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, how prone they are to censure, and how any one will be regarded as illiterate and stupid who, when questions are addressed to him, can return no answer.</q> On reading this sentence, I felt a burning desire to reply to your letter; for, by the morbid weakness of mind which this indicated, you pierced my inmost heart, and forced your way into the midst of my cares, so that I could not refuse to minister to your relief, so far as God might enable me&mdash; not by devising a solution of your difficulties, but by breaking the connection between your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and the wretched support on which it now insecurely hangs, viz. the opinions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and fastening it to a hold which is firm and immovable. Do you not, O Dioscorus, remember an ingenious line of your favourite Persius, in which he not only rebukes your folly, but administers to your boyish head, if you have only sense to feel it, a deserved correction, restraining your vanity with the words, <q>To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is nothing in your eyes unless another <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a></q>?  You have, as I said before, read so many Dialogues, and devoted your attention to so many discussions of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>&mdash; tell me which of them has placed the chief end of his actions in the applause of the vulgar, or in the opinion even of good and wise men? But you&mdash;and what should make you the more ashamed&mdash;you, when on the eve of sailing away from Africa, give evidence of your having made signal progress, forsooth, in your studies here, when you affirm that the only reason why you impose the task of expounding Cicero to you upon <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who are already oppressed with work and engrossed with matters of a very different nature, is, that you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that if, when questioned by men prone to censure, you cannot answer, you will be regarded by them as illiterate and stupid. O <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> well worthy to occupy the hours which <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> devote to study while other men sleep!</p>

<p>4. You seem to me to be prompted to mental effort night and day by no other motive than ambition to be praised by men for your industry and acquisitions in learning. Although I have ever regarded this as fraught with danger to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are striving after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and the right, I am now, by your case, more convinced of the danger than before. For it is due to no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> than this same pernicious habit that you have failed to see by what motive we might be induced to grant to you what you asked; for as by a perverted judgment you yourself are urged on to acquire a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the things about which you put questions, from no other motive than that you may receive praise or escape censure from men, you <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that we, by a like perversity of judgment, are to be influenced by the considerations alleged in your request. Would that, when we declare to you that by your writing such things concerning yourself we are moved, not to grant your request, but to reprove and correct you, we might be able to effect for you also complete emancipation from the influence of a boon so worthless and deceitful as the applause of men! <q>It is the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,</q> you say, <q>to be prone to censure.</q> What then? <q>Any one who can make no reply when questions are addressed to him,</q> you say, <q>will be regarded as illiterate and stupid.</q> Behold, then, I ask you a question not concerning something in the books of Cicero, whose meaning, perchance, his readers may not be able to find, but concerning your own letter and the meaning of your own words. My question is: Why did you not say, <q>Any one who can make no reply will be <em><a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a></em> to be illiterate and stupid,</q> but prefer to say, He will be <em>regarded</em> as illiterate and stupid ? Why, if not for this reason, that you yourself already understand well enough that the person who fails to answer such questions is not in reality, but only in the opinion of some, illiterate and stupid? But I warn you that he who fears to be subjected to the edge of the pruning-hook by the tongues of such men is a sapless log, and is therefore not only regarded as illiterate and stupid, but is actually such, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be so.</p>

<p>5. Perhaps you will say, <q>But seeing that I am not stupid, and that I am specially earnest in striving not to be stupid, I am reluctant even to be regarded as stupid.</q> And rightly so; but I ask, What is your motive in this reluctance? For in stating why you did not hesitate to burden us with those questions which you wish to have solved and explained, you said that this was the reason, and that this was the end, and an end so necessary in your estimation that you said it was of overwhelming urgency&mdash;lest, forsooth, if you were posed with these questions and gave no answer, you should be regarded as illiterate and stupid by men prone to censure. Now, I ask, is this [jealousy as to your own <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>] the whole reason why you beg this from us, or is it because of some ulterior object that you are unwilling to be thought illiterate and stupid? If this be the whole reason, you see, as I think, that this one thing [the praise of men] is the end pursued by that vehement <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of yours, by which, as you admit, a burden is imposed on us. But, from Dioscorus, what can be to us a burden, except that burden which Dioscorus himself unconsciously bears&mdash;a burden which he will begin to feel only when he attempts to rise,&mdash; a burden of which I would fain <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that it is not so bound to him as to defy his efforts to shake his shoulders free? And this I say not because these questions engage your studies, but because they are studied by you for such an end. For surely you by this time feel that this end is trivial, unsubstantial, and light as air. It is also apt to produce in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> what may be likened to a dangerous swelling, beneath which lurk the germs of decay, and by it the eye of the mind becomes suffused, so that it cannot discern the riches of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Believe this, my Dioscorus, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: so shall I enjoy you in unfeigned longing for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and in that essential dignity of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the shadow of which you are turned aside. If I have failed to convince you of this by the method which I have now used, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no other that I can use. For you do not see it; nor can you possibly see it so long as you build your joys on the crumbling foundation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> applause.</p>

<p>6. If, however, this be not the end aimed at in these actions and by this <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of yours, but there is some other ulterior reason for your unwillingness to be regarded as illiterate and stupid, I ask what that reason is. If it be to remove impediments to the acquisition of temporal riches, or the obtaining of a wife, or the grasping of honours, and other things of that kind which are flowing past with a headlong current, and dragging to the bottom those who fall into them, it is assuredly not our duty to help you towards that end, nay, rather we ought to turn you away from it. For we do not so forbid your fixing the aim of your studies in the precarious possession of renown as to make you leave, as it were, the waters of the Mincius and enter the Eridanus, into which, perchance, the Mincius would carry you even without yourself making the change. For when the vanity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> applause has failed to satisfy the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, because it furnishes for its nourishment nothing real and substantial, this same eager desire compels the mind to go on to something else as more rich and productive; and if, nevertheless, this also belong to the things which pass away with time, it is as when one river leads us into another, so that there can be no rest from our miseries so long as the end aimed at in our discharge of duty is placed in that which is unstable. We desire, therefore, that in some firm and immutable good you should fix the home of your most steadfast efforts, and the perfectly secure resting-place of all your good and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> activity. Is it, perchance, your intention, if you succeed by the breath of propitious fame, or even by spreading your sails for its fitful gusts, in reaching that earthly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of which I have spoken, to make it subservient to the acquisition of the other&mdash; the sure and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and satisfying good? But to me it does not seem probable&mdash; and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself forbids the supposition&mdash; that it should be reached either by such a circuitous way when it is at hand, or at such cost when it is freely given.</p>

<p>7. Perhaps you think that we ought to turn the praise of men itself to good account as an instrument for making others accessible to counsels regarding that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and useful; and perhaps you are anxious lest, if men regard you as illiterate and stupid, they think you unworthy to receive their earnest or patient attention, if you were either exhorting any one to do well, or reproving the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of an evil-doer. If, in proposing these questions, you contemplated this righteous and beneficent end, we have certainly been wronged by your not giving the preference to this in your letter as the consideration by which we might be moved either to grant willingly what you asked, or, if declining your request, to do so on the ground of some other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which might perchance prevent us, but not on the ground of our being ashamed to accept the position of serving or even not resisting the aspirations of your vanity. For, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, consider how much better and more profitable it is for you to receive from us with far more certainty and with less loss of time those principles of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by which you can for yourself refute all that is false, and by so doing be prevented from cherishing an opinion so false and contemptible as this&mdash; that you are learned and intelligent if you have studied with a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in which there is more <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> than <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> the worn-out <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of many writers of a bygone age. But this opinion I do not suppose you now to hold, for surely I have not in vain spoken so long to Dioscorus things so manifestly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and from this, as understood, I proceed with my letter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>8. Wherefore, seeing that you do not consider a man illiterate and stupid merely on the ground of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of these things, but only if he be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, and that, consequently, the opinions of any one who has written or may have written on these subjects are either <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and therefore are already held by you, or false, and therefore you may be content not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them, and need not be consumed with vain solicitude about <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the variety of the opinions of other men under the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of otherwise remaining illiterate and stupid&mdash;seeing, I say, that this is the case, let us now, if you please, consider whether, in the event of other men, who are, as you say, prone to censure, finding you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of these things, and therefore regarding you, though <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, as an illiterate and stupid person, this mistake of theirs ought to have so much weight with you as to make it not unseemly for you to apply to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for instruction in these things. I propose this on the assumption that we now <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you to be seeking this instruction in order that by it you may be helped in recommending the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and in reclaiming men who, if they supposed you to be illiterate and stupid in regard to those books of Cicero, would regard you as a person from whom they considered it unworthy of them to receive any useful or profitable instruction. Believe me, you are under a mistake.</p>

<p>9. For, in the first place, I do not at all see that, in the countries in which you are so afraid of being esteemed deficient in education and acuteness, there are any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who will ask you a single question about these matters. Both in this country, to which you came to learn these things, and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by experience how little they are esteemed, and that, in consequence, they are neither taught nor learned; and throughout all Africa, so far are you from being troubled by any such questioner, that you cannot find any one who will be troubled with your questions, and are compelled by the dearth of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to send your questions to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be solved by them: as if, indeed, these <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, although in their youth, under the influence of the same ardour&mdash; let me rather say <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>&mdash; which carries you away, they were at pains to learn these things as matters of great moment, permitted them still to remain in memory now that their heads are white with age and they are burdened with the responsibilities of episcopal office; or as if, supposing them to desire to retain these things in memory, greater and graver cares would not in spite of their desire banish them from their hearts; or as if, in the event of some of these things lingering in recollection by the force of long habit, they would not wish rather to bury in utter oblivion what was thus remembered, than to answer senseless questions at a time when, even amidst the comparative leisure enjoyed in the schools and in the lecture-rooms of rhetoricians, they seem to have so lost both voice and vigour that, in order to have instruction imparted concerning them, it is deemed necessary to send from <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> to Hippo,&mdash; a place in which all such things are so unwonted and so wholly foreign, that if, in taking the trouble of writing an answer to your question, I wished to look at any passage to discover the order of thought in the context preceding or following the words requiring exposition, I would be utterly unable to find a manuscript of the works of Cicero. However, these teachers of rhetoric in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> who have failed to satisfy you in this matter are not only not blamed, but, on the contrary, commended by me, if, as I suppose, they have not forgotten that the scene of these contests was wont to be, not the Roman forum, but the Greek gymnasia. But when you have applied your mind to these gymnasia, and have found even them to be in such things bare and cold, the church of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Hippo occurred to you as a place where you might lay down your cares, because the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> now occupying that see at one time took fees for instructing boys in these things. But, on the one hand, I do not wish you to be still a boy, and, on the other hand, it is not becoming for me, either for a fee or as a favour, to be dealing now in childish things. This, therefore, being the case&mdash; seeing, that is to say, that these two great cities, Rome and <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, the living centres of Latin literature, neither try your patience by asking you such questions as you speak of, nor care patiently to listen to you when you propound them, I am amazed in a degree beyond all expression that a young man of your good sense should be afraid lest you should be afflicted with any questioner on these subjects in the cities of Greece and of the East. You are much more likely to hear jackdaws  in Africa than this manner of conversation in those lands.</p>

<p>10. Suppose, however, in the next place, that I am wrong, and that perchance some one should arise putting questions like these&mdash;a phenomenon the more unwelcome because in those parts peculiarly absurd&mdash;are you not much more afraid lest far more readily men arise who, being Greeks, and finding you settled in Greece, and acquainted with the Greek language as your mother tongue, may ask you some things in the original works of their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> which Cicero may not have put into his treatises? If this happen, what reply will you make? Will you say that you preferred to learn these things from the books of Latin rather than of Greek authors? By such an answer you will, in the first place, put an affront upon Greece; and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how men of that nation resent this. And in the next place, they being now wounded and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, how readily will you find what you are too anxious to avoid, that they will count you on the one hand stupid, because you preferred to learn the opinions of the Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, or, more properly speaking, some isolated and scattered tenets of their <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, in Latin dialogues, rather than to study the complete and connected system of their opinions in the Greek originals, and, on the other hand, illiterate, because, although <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of so many things written in your language, you have unsuccessfully laboured to gather some of them together from writings in a foreign tongue. Or will you perhaps reply that you did not despise the Greek writings on these subjects, but that you devoted your attention first to the study of Latin works, and now, proficient in these, are beginning to inquire after Greek learning? If this does not make you blush, to confess that you, being a Greek, have in your boyhood learned Latin, and are now, like a man of some foreign nation,  desirous of studying Greek literature, surely you will not blush to own that in the department of Latin literature you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of some things, of which you may perceive how many versed in Latin learning are equally <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, if you will only consider that, although living in the midst of so many learned men in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, you assure me that it is under the pressure of necessity that you impose this burden on me.</p>

<p>11. Finally, suppose that you, being asked all those questions which you have submitted to me, have been able to answer them all. Behold! You are now spoken of as most learned and most acute; behold! now this insignificant breath of Greek laudation raises you to heaven. Be it yours now to remember your responsibilities and the end for which you <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> these praises, namely, that to men who have been easily won to admire you by these trifles, and who are now hanging most affectionately and eagerly on your lips, you may impart some <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> important and wholesome instruction; and I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you possess, and can rightly impart to others, that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> most important and wholesome. For it is absurd if, after learning many unnecessary things with a view to preparing the ears of men to receive what is necessary, you be found not to possess those necessary things for the reception of which you have by these unnecessary things prepared the way; it is absurd if, while busying yourself with learning things by which you may win men's attention, you refuse to learn that which may be poured into their minds when their attention is secured. But if you reply that you have already learned this, and say that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> supremely necessary is <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine, which I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you esteem above all other things, placing in it alone your hope of everlasting <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, then surely this does not demand a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the Dialogues of Cicero, and a collection of the beggarly and divided opinions of other men, in order to your persuading men to give it a hearing. Let your character and manner of life command the attention of those who are to receive any such teaching from you. I would not have you open the way for teaching <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by first teaching what must be afterwards unlearned.</p>

<p>12. For if the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the discordant and mutually contradictory opinions of others is of any service to him who would obtain an entrance for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in overthrowing the opposition of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, it is useful only in the way of preventing the assailant of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from being at liberty to fix his eye solely on the work of controverting your tenets, while carefully hiding his own from view. For the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is of itself sufficient both to detect and to subvert all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, even those which may not have been heard before, if only they are brought forward. If, however, in order to secure not only the demolition of open <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, but also the rooting out of those which lurk in darkness, it is necessary for you to be acquainted with the erroneous opinions which others have advanced, let both eye and ear be wakeful, I beseech you&mdash;look well and listen well whether any of our assailants bring forward a single argument from Anaximenes and from Anaxagoras, when, though the Stoic and Epicurean philosophies were more recent and taught largely, even their ashes are not so warm as that a single spark can be struck out from them against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The din which resounds in the battlefield of controversy now comes from innumerable small companies and cliques of sectaries, some of them easily discomfited, others presuming to make bold resistance&mdash;such as the partisans of Donatus, Maximian, and Manich&aelig;us here, or the unruly herds of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, Eunomians, Macedonians, and Cataphrygians and other pests which abound in the countries to which you are on your way. If you shrink from the task of acquainting yourself with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of all these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, what occasion have we in defending the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> to inquire after the tenets of Anaximenes, and with idle curiosity to awaken anew controversies which have slept for ages, when already the cavillings and arguments even of some of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who claimed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, such as the Marcionites and the Sabellians, and many more, have been put to silence? Nevertheless, if it be necessary, as I have said, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> beforehand some of the opinions which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and become thoroughly conversant with these, it is our duty to give a place in such study to the heretics  who call themselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, much rather than to Anaxagoras and Democritus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>13. Again, whoever may put to you the questions which you have propounded to us, let him understand that, under the guidance of deeper erudition and greater wisdom, you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of things like these. For if Themistocles regarded it as a small matter that he was looked upon as imperfectly <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> when he had declined to play on the lyre at a banquet, and at the same time, when, after he had confessed <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this accomplishment, one said, <q>What, then, do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>?</q> gave as his reply, <q>The art of making a small republic great</q>&mdash; are you to hesitate about admitting <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in trifles like these, when it is in your power to answer any one who may ask, <q>What, then, do you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>?</q>&mdash; <q>The secret by which without such <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> a man may be blessed</q>? And if you do not yet possess this secret, you act in searching into those other matters with as blind perversity as if, when labouring under some dangerous disease of the body, you eagerly sought after dainties in food and finery in dress, instead of physic and physicians. For this attainment ought not to be put off upon any pretext whatever, and no other <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> ought, especially in our age, to receive a prior place in your studies. And now see how easily you may have this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> if you desire it. He who inquires how he may attain a blessed life is assuredly inquiring after nothing else than this: where is the highest good? In other words, wherein resides man's supreme good, not according to the perverted and hasty opinions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but according to the sure and immovable <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Now its residence is not found by any one except in the body, or in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or in two of these, or in the three combined. If, then, you have learned that neither the supreme good nor any part whatever of the supreme good is in the body, the remaining alternatives are, that it is in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or in both combined. And if now you have also learned that what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the body in this respect is equally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, what now remains but God Himself as the One in whom resides man's supreme good?&mdash; not that there are no other goods, but that good is called the supreme good to which all others are related. For every one is blessed when he enjoys that for the sake of which he desires to have all other things, seeing that it is loved for its own sake, and not on account of something else. And the supreme good is said to be there because at this point nothing is found towards which the supreme good can go forth, or to which it is related. In it is the resting-place of desire; in it is assured fruition; in it the most tranquil satisfaction of a will morally perfect.</p>

<p>14. Give me a man who sees at once that the body is not the good of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, but that the mind is rather the good of the body: with such a man we would, of course, forbear from inquiring whether the highest good of which we speak, or any part of it, is in the body. For that the mind is better than the body is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which it would be utter folly to deny. Equally absurd would it be to deny that that which gives a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, or any part of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, is better than that which receives the boon. The <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, therefore, does not receive from the body either the supreme good or any part of the supreme good. Men who do not see this have been blinded by that sweetness of carnal pleasures which they do not discern to be a consequence of imperfect health. Now, perfect health of body shall be the consummation of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of the whole man. For God has endowed the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with a nature so powerful, that from that consummate fullness of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in the end of time, some portion overflows also upon the lower part of our nature, the body&mdash;not the blessedness which is proper to the part which enjoys and understands, but the plenitude of health, that is, the vigour of incorruption. Men who, as I have said, do not see this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with each other in unsatisfactory debates, each maintaining the view which may please his own fancy, but all placing the supreme good of man in the body, and so stir up crowds of disorderly carnal minds, of whom the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> have flourished in pre-eminent estimation with the unlearned multitude.</p>

<p>15. Give me a man who sees at once, moreover, that when the mind is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> not by good which belongs to itself, else it would never be unhappy: and with such a man we would, of course, forbear from inquiring whether that highest and, so to speak, bliss-bestowing good, or any part of it, is in the mind. For when the mind is elated with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in itself, as if in good which belongs to itself, it is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>. But when the mind perceives itself to be mutable&mdash;a fact which may be learned from this, even though nothing else <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> it, that the mind from being foolish may be made wise&mdash;and apprehends that wisdom is unchangeable, it must at the same time apprehend that wisdom is superior to its own nature, and that it finds more abundant and abiding <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the communications and light of wisdom than in itself. Thus desisting and subsiding from boasting and self-conceit, it strives to cling to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to be recruited and reformed by Him who is unchangeable; whom it now understands to be the Author not only of every species of all things with which it comes in contact, either by the bodily senses or by intellectual faculties, but also of even the very capacity of taking form before any form has been taken, since the formless is defined to be that which can receive a form. Therefore it feels its own instability more, just in proportion as it clings less to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose being is perfect: it discerns also that the perfection of His being is consummate because He is immutable, and therefore neither gains nor loses, but that in itself every change by which it gains capacity for perfect clinging to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is advantageous, but every change by which it loses is pernicious, and further, that all loss tends towards destruction; and although it is not manifest whether any thing is ultimately destroyed, it is manifest to every one that the loss brings destruction so far that the object no longer is what it was. Whence the mind infers that the one reason why things suffer loss, or are liable to suffer loss, is, that they were made out of nothing; so that their property of being, and of permanence, and the arrangement whereby each finds even according to its imperfections its own place in the complex whole, all depend on the goodness and omnipotence of Him whose being is perfect,  and who is the Creator able to make out of nothing not only something, but something great; and that the first <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, <em>i.e.</em> the first <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> loss, is rejoicing in its own power: for it rejoices in something less than would be the source of its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> if it rejoiced in the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is unquestionably greater. Not perceiving this, and looking only to the capacities of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and the great beauty of its achievements in word and deed, some, who would have been ashamed to place man's supreme good in the body, have, by placing it in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, assigned to it unquestionably a lower sphere than that assigned to it by unsophisticated reason. Among Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who hold these views, the chief place both in number of adherents and in subtlety of disputation has been held by the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who have, however, in consequence of their opinion that in nature everything is material, succeeded in turning the mind rather from carnal than material objects.</p>

<p>16. Among those, again, who say that our supreme and only good is to enjoy <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom both we ourselves and all things were made, the most eminent have been the Platonists, who not unreasonably judged it to belong to their duty to confute the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>&mdash; the latter especially, and almost exclusively. The Academic School is identical with the Platonists, as is shown plainly enough by the links of unbroken succession connecting the schools. For if you ask who was the predecessor of Arcesilas, the first who, announcing no doctrine of his own, set himself to the one work of refuting the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, you will find that it was Polemo; ask who preceded Polemo, it was Xenocrates; but Xenocrates was <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, and by him appointed his successor in the academy. Wherefore, as to this question concerning the supreme good, if we set aside the representatives of conflicting views, and consider the abstract question, you find at once that two <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> confront each other as diametrically opposed&mdash; the one declaring the body, and the other declaring the mind to be the seat of the supreme good of men. You find also that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> enlightened reason, by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is perceived to be our supreme good, is opposed to both of these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, but does not impart the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> until it has first made men unlearn what is false. If now you consider the question in connection with the advocates of different views, you will find the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> and <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> most keenly contending with each other, and the Platonists, on the other hand, endeavouring to decide the controversy between them, concealing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which they held, and devoting themselves only to prove and overthrow the vain confidence with which the others adhered to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>17. It was not in the power of the Platonists, however, to be so efficient in supporting the side of reason enlightened by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as the others were in supporting their own <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. For from them all there was then withheld that example of divine humility, which, in the fullness of time,  was furnished by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>&mdash;that one example before which, even in the mind of the most headstrong and arrogant, all <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> bends, breaks, and dies. And therefore the Platonists, not being able by their authority to lead the mass of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, blinded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of earthly things, into <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in things invisible&mdash;although they saw them moved, especially by the arguments of the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, not only to drink freely the cup of the pleasures of the body to which they were naturally inclined, but even to plead for these, affirming that they constitute man's highest good; although, moreover, they saw that those who were moved to abstinence from these pleasures by the praise of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> found it easier to regard pleasure as having its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> seat in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, whence the good actions, concerning which they were able, in some measure, to form an opinion, proceeded&mdash;at the same time, saw that if they attempted to introduce into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the notion of something divine and supremely immutable, which cannot be reached by any one of the bodily senses, but is apprehensible only by reason, which, nevertheless, surpasses in its nature the mind itself, and were to teach that this is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, set before the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to be enjoyed by it when purged from all stains of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> desires, in whom alone every longing after <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> finds rest, and in whom alone we ought to find the consummation of all good&mdash;men would not understand them, and would much more readily award the palm to their antagonists, whether <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> or <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>; the result of which would be a thing most disastrous to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, namely, that the doctrine, which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and profitable, would become sullied by the contempt of the uneducated masses. So much in regard to Ethical questions.</p>

<p>18. As to Physics, if the Platonists taught that the originating <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all natures is immaterial wisdom, and if, on the other hand, the rival <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> never got above material things, while the beginning of all things was attributed by some to atoms, by others to the four elements, in which fire was of special power in the construction of all things&mdash;who could fail to see to which opinion a favourable verdict would be given, when the great mass of unthinking men are enthralled by material things, and can in no wise comprehend that an immaterial power could form the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>?</p>

<p>19. The department of dialectic questions remains to be discussed; for, as you are aware, all questions in the pursuit of wisdom are classified under three heads&mdash;Ethics, Physics, and Dialectics. When, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> said that the senses are never deceived, and, though the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> admitted that they sometimes are mistaken, both placed in the senses the standard by which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is to be comprehended, who would listen to the Platonists when both of these <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> opposed them? Who would look upon them as entitled to be esteemed men at all, and much less wise men, if, without hesitation or qualification, they affirmed not only that there is something which cannot be discerned by touch, or smell, or taste, or hearing, or sight, and which cannot be conceived of by any image borrowed from the things with which the senses acquaint us, but that this alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> exists, and is alone capable of being perceived, because it is alone unchangeable and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, but is perceived only by reason, the faculty whereby alone <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in so far as it can be discovered by us, is found?</p>

<p>20. Seeing, therefore, that the Platonists held opinions which they could not impart to men enthralled by the flesh; seeing also that they were not of such authority among the common people as to persuade them to accept what they ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> until the mind should be trained to that condition in which these things can be understood&mdash;they chose to hide their own opinions, and to content themselves with arguing against those who, although they affirmed that the discovery of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is made through the senses of the body, boasted that they had found the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, what occasion have we to inquire as to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their teaching? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it was not divine, nor invested with any divine authority. But this one fact merits our attention, that whereas <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> is in many ways most clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by Cicero to have placed both the supreme good and the causes of things, and the certainty of the processes of reason, in Wisdom, not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but divine, whence in some way the light of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> wisdom is derived&mdash; in Wisdom which is wholly immutable, and in Truth always consistent with itself; and whereas we also learn from Cicero that the followers of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> laboured to overthrow the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> and <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, who placed the supreme good, the causes of things, and the certainty of the processes of reason, in the nature either of body or of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>&mdash;the controversy had continued rolling on with successive centuries, so that even at the commencement of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era, when the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of things invisible and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> was with saving power preached by means of visible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who could neither see nor <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> anything beyond things material, these same <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a> and <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> are found in the Acts of the Apostles to have opposed themselves to the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who was beginning to scatter the seeds of that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>21. By which thing it seems to me to be sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in ethics, physics, and the mode of seeking <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> many and manifold, but conspicuously represented in these two schools of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, continued even down to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> era, notwithstanding the fact that the learned assailed them most vehemently, and employed both remarkable skill and abundant labour in subverting them. Yet these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> we see in our time to have been already so completely silenced, that now in our schools of rhetoric the question what their opinions were is scarcely ever mentioned; and these controversies have been now so completely eradicated or suppressed in even the Greek gymnasia, notably fond of discussion, that whenever now any school of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> lifts up its head against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <em>i.e.</em> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it does not venture to leap into the arena except under the shield of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name. Whence it is obvious that the <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Platonist</a> school of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> felt it necessary, having changed those few things in their opinions which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> teaching condemned, to submit with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> homage to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the only King who is invincible, and to apprehend the Incarnate <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, at whose command the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which they had even feared to publish was immediately <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>.</p>

<p>22. To Him, my Dioscorus, I desire you to submit yourself with unreserved <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and I wish you to prepare for yourself no other way of seizing and holding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than that which has been prepared by Him who, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saw the weakness of our goings. In that way the first part is humility; the second, humility; the third, humility: and this I would continue to repeat as often as you might ask direction, not that there are no other instructions which may be given, but because, unless humility precede, accompany, and follow every good action which we perform, being at once the object which we keep before our eyes, the support to which we cling, and the monitor by which we are restrained, <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> wrests wholly from our hand any good work on which we are congratulating ourselves.  All other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are to be apprehended when we are doing wrong; but <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is to be feared even when we do right actions, lest those things which are done in a praiseworthy manner be spoiled by the desire for praise itself. Wherefore, as that most illustrious orator, on being asked what seemed to him the first thing to be observed in the art of eloquence, is said to have replied, Delivery; and when he was asked what was the second thing, replied again, Delivery; and when asked what was the third thing, still gave no other reply than this, Delivery; so if you were to ask me, however often you might repeat the question, what are the instructions of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, I would be disposed to answer always and only, <q>Humility,</q> although, perchance, necessity might constrain me to speak also of other things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>23. To this most wholesome humility, in which <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is our teacher&mdash; having submitted to humiliation that He might instruct us in this&mdash; to this humility, I say, the most formidable adversary is a certain kind of most unenlightened <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, if I may so call it, in which we congratulate ourselves on <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what may have been the views of Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, Democritus, and others of the same kind, imagining that by this we become learned men and scholars, although such attainments are far removed from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> learning and erudition. For the man who has learned that God is not extended or diffused through space, either finite or <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, so as to be greater in one part and less in another, but that He is wholly present everywhere, as the Truth is, of which no one in his senses will affirm that it is partly in one place, partly in another&mdash; and the Truth is God Himself&mdash; such a man will not be moved by the opinions of any <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> soever who believes [like Anaximenes] that the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> air around us is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. What matters it to such a man though he be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> what bodily form they speak of, since they speak of a form which is bounded on all sides? What matters it to him whether it was only as an Academician, and merely for the purpose of confuting Anaximenes, who had said that God is a material <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>&mdash;for air is material&mdash;that Cicero objected that God must have form and beauty?  or himself perceived that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has immaterial form and beauty, by which the mind itself is moulded, and by which we judge all the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the wise man to be beautiful, and therefore affirmed that God must be of the most perfect beauty, not merely for the purpose of confuting an antagonist, but with profound insight into the fact that nothing is more beautiful than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, which is cognisable by the understanding alone, and is immutable? Moreover, as to the opinion of Anaximenes, who held that the air is generated, and at the same time <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it does not in the least move the man who understands that, since the air is certainly not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is no likeness between the manner in which the air is generated, that is to say, produced by some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, and the manner, understood by none except through divine inspiration, in which He was begotten who is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, God with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Moreover, who does not see that even in regard to material things he speaks most foolishly in affirming that air is generated, and is at the same time <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, while he refuses to give the name of God to that by which the air has been generated&mdash;for it is impossible that it could be generated by no power? Yet once more, his saying that the air is always in motion will have no disturbing influence as <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the air is God upon the man who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that all movements of body are of a lower order than movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but that even the movements of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are infinitely slow compared with His who is supreme and immutable Wisdom.</p>

<p>24. In like manner, if Anaxagoras or any other affirm that the mind is essential <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and wisdom,  what call have I to debate with a man about a word? For it is manifest that mind gives being to the order and mode of all things, and that it may be suitably called <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> with respect not to its extension in space, but to its power, the range of which transcends all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thought. Nor [shall I dispute his assertion] that this essential wisdom is formless; for this is a property of material things, that whatever bodies are <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> are also formless. Cicero, however, from his desire to confute such opinions, as I suppose, in contending with adversaries who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in nothing immaterial, denies that anything can be annexed to that which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, because in things material there must be a boundary at the part to which anything is annexed. Therefore he says that Anaxagoras <q>did not see that motion joined to sensation and to it</q> (<em>i.e.</em> linked to it in unbroken connection) <q>is impossible in the <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a></q> (that is, in a substance which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>), as if treating of material substances, to which nothing can be joined except at their boundaries. Moreover, in the succeeding words&mdash; <q>and that sensation of which the whole system of nature is not sensible when struck is an impossibility</q> &mdash; Cicero speaks as if Anaxagoras had said that mind&mdash; to which he ascribed the power of ordering and fashioning all things&mdash; had sensation such as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has by means of the body. For it is manifest that the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has sensation when it feels anything by means of the body; for whatever is perceived by sensation is not concealed from the whole <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now, Cicero's design in saying that the whole system of nature must be conscious of every sensation was, that he might, as it were, take from the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> that mind which he affirms to be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. For how does the whole of nature experience sensation if it be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>? Bodily sensation begins at some point, and does not pervade the whole of any substance unless it be one in which it can reach an end; but this, of course, cannot be said of that which is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. Anaxagoras, however had not said anything about bodily sensation. The word <q>whole,</q> moreover, is used differently when we speak of that which is immaterial, because it is understood to be without boundaries in space, so that it may be spoken of as a whole and at the same time as <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>&mdash; the former because of its completeness, the latter because of its not being limited by boundaries in space.</p>

<p>25. <q>Furthermore,</q> says Cicero, <q>if he will affirm that the mind itself is, so to speak, some kind of animal, there must be some principle from within from which it receives the name 'animal,'</q>&mdash; so that <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, according to Anaxagoras, is a kind of body, and has within it an animating principle, because of which it is called <q>animal.</q> Observe how he speaks in language which we are accustomed to apply to things corporeal&mdash;animals being in the ordinary sense of the word visible substances,&mdash; adapting himself, as I suppose, to the blunted perceptions of those against whom he argues; and yet he has uttered a thing which, if they could awake to perceive it, might suffice to teach them that everything which presents itself to our minds as a living body must be thought of not as itself a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but as an animal having a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For having said, <q>There must be something within from which it receives the name animal,</q> he adds, <q>But what is deeper within than mind?</q> The <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, therefore, cannot have any inner <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, by possessing which it is an animal; for it is itself that which is innermost. If, then, it is an animal, let it have some external body in relation to which it may be within; for this is what he means by saying, <q>It is therefore girt round by an exterior body,</q> as if Anaxagoras had said that mind cannot be otherwise than as belonging to some animal. And yet Anaxagoras held the opinion that essential supreme Wisdom is <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, although it is not the peculiar property of any living being, so to speak, since Truth is near to all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> alike that are able to enjoy it. Observe, therefore, how wittily he concludes the argument: <q>Since this is not the opinion of Anaxagoras</q> (<em>i.e.</em> seeing that he does not hold that that mind which he calls God is girt about with an external body, through its relation to which it could be an animal), <q>we must say that mind pure and simple, without the addition of anything</q> (<em>i.e.</em> of any body) <q>through which it may exercise sensation, seems to be beyond the range and conceptions of our intelligence.</q> </p>

<p>26. Nothing is more certain than that this lies beyond the range and conception of the intelligence of <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> and <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicureans</a>, who cannot think of anything which is not material. But by the word <q>our</q> intelligence he means <q><a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a></q> intelligence; and he very properly does not say, <q>it lies beyond our intelligence,</q> but <q>it seems to lie beyond.</q> For their opinion is, that this lies beyond the understanding of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and therefore they think that nothing of the kind can be. But there are some whose intelligence apprehends, in so far as this is given to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the fact that there is pure and simple Wisdom and Truth, which is the peculiar property of no living being, but which imparts wisdom and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> alike which are susceptible of its influence. If Anaxagoras perceived the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of this supreme Wisdom, and apprehended it to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and called it Mind, it is not by the mere name of this <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>&mdash; with whom, on account of his place in the remote antiquity of erudition, all raw recruits in literature  (to adopt a military phrase) delight to boast an acquaintance&mdash; that we are made learned and wise; nor is it even by our having the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> through which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ought to be dear to me not merely because it was not unknown to Anaxagoras, but because, even though none of these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> it, it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>27. If, therefore, it is unbecoming for us to be elated either by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the man who perhaps apprehended the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> we obtain, as it were, the appearance of learning, or even by the solid possession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, whereby we obtain real acquisitions in learning, how much less can the names and tenets of those men who were in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> assist us in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> learning and in making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> things obscure? For if we be men, it would be more fitting that we should grieve on account of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> into which so many famous men fell, if we happen to hear of them, than that we should studiously investigate them, in order that, among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of them, we may enjoy the gratification of a most contemptible conceit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. For how much better would it be that I should never have heard the name of Democritus, than that I should now with sorrow ponder the fact that a man was highly esteemed in his own age who thought that the gods were images which emanated from solid bodies, but were not solid themselves; and that these, circling this way and that way by their independent motion, and gliding into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, make the divine power enter into the region of their thoughts, although, certainly, that body from which the image emanated may be rightly judged to surpass the image in excellence and proportion, as it surpasses it in solidity. Hence his opinion wavered, as they say, and oscillated, so that sometimes he said that the deity was some kind of nature from which images emanate, and which nevertheless can be thought of only by means of those images which he pours forth and sends out, that is, which from that nature (which he considered to be something material and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and on this very account divine) were borne as by a kind of evaporation or continuous emanation, and came and entered into our minds, so that we could form the thought of a god or gods. For these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> conceive of no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of thought in our minds, except when images from those bodies which are the object of our thoughts come and enter into our minds; as if, forsooth, there were not many things, yea, more than we can number, which, without any material form, and yet intelligible, are apprehended by those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to apprehend such things. Take as an example essential Wisdom and Truth, of which if they can frame no idea, I wonder why they dispute concerning it at all; if, however, they do frame some idea of it in thought, I wish they would tell me either from what body the image of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> comes into their minds, or of what kind it is.</p>

<p>28. Democritus, however, is said to differ here also in his doctrine on physics from <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>; for he holds that there is in the concourse of atoms a certain vital and breathing power, by which power (I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>) he affirms that the images themselves (not all images of all things, but images of the gods) are endued with divine attributes, and that the first beginnings of the mind are in those universal elements to which he ascribed divinity, and that the images possess life, inasmuch as they are wont either to benefit or to hurt us. <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>, however, does not assume anything in the first beginnings of things but atoms, that is, certain corpuscles, so minute that they cannot be divided or perceived either by sight or by touch; and his doctrine is, that by the fortuitous concourse (clashing) of these atoms, <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> is given both to innumerable worlds and to living things, and to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which animate them, and to the gods whom, in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a>, he has located, not in any world, but outside of the worlds, and in the spaces which separate them; and he will not allow of any object of thought beyond things material. But in order to these becoming an object of thought, he says that from those things which he represents as formed of atoms, images more subtle than those which come to our eyes flow down and enter into the mind. For according to him, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our seeing is to be found in certain images so huge that they embrace the whole outer world. But I suppose that you already understand their opinions regarding these images.</p>

<p>29. I wonder that Democritus was not convinced of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> even by this fact, that such huge images coming into our minds, which are so small (if being, as they affirm, material, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is confined within the body's dimensions), could not possibly, in the entirety of their size, come into contact with it. For when a small body is brought into contact with a large one, it cannot in any wise be touched at the same moment by all points of the larger. How, then, are these images at the same moment in their whole extent objects of thought, if they become objects of thought only in so far as, coming and entering into the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, they touch it, seeing that they cannot in their whole extent either find entrance into so small a body or come in contact with so small a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>? Bear in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, of course, that I am speaking now after their manner; for I do not hold the mind to be such as they affirm. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> alone can be assailed with this argument, if Democritus holds that the mind is immaterial; but we may ask him in turn why he did not perceive that it is at once unnecessary and impossible for the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, being immaterial, to think through the approach and contact of material images. Both <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> alike are certainly confuted by the facts of vision; for images so great cannot possibly touch in their entirety eyes so small.</p>

<p>30. Moreover, when the question is put to them, how it comes that one image is seen of a body from which images emanate in countless multitudes, their answer is, that just because the images are emanating and passing in such multitudes, the effect produced by their being crowded and massed together is, that out of the many one is seen. The absurdity of this Cicero exposes by saying that their deity cannot be thought of as <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, for this very reason, that he is thought of through images which are in countless multitudes flowing forth and passing away. And when they say that the forms of the gods are rendered <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> by the innumerable hosts of atoms supplying constant reinforcements, so that other corpuscles immediately take the place of those which depart from the divine substance, and by the same succession prevent the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the gods from being dissolved, Cicero replies, <q>On this ground all things would be <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> as well as the gods,</q> since there is nothing which has not the same boundless store of atoms by which it may repair its perpetual decays. Again, he asks how their god could be otherwise than afraid of coming to destruction, seeing that he is without a moment's intermission beaten and shaken by an unceasing incursion of atoms,&mdash; beaten, inasmuch as he is struck by atoms rushing upon him, and shaken, inasmuch as he is penetrated by atoms rushing through him. Nay, more; seeing that from himself there emanate continually images (of which we have said enough), what good ground can he have for persuasion of his own <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>? </p>

<p>31. As to all these ravings of the men who entertain such opinions, it is especially deplorable that the mere statement of them does not suffice to secure their rejection without any one controverting them in discussion; instead of which, the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> most gifted with acuteness have accepted the task of copiously refuting opinions which, as soon as they were enunciated, ought to have been rejected with contempt even by the slowest intellects. For even granting that there are atoms, and that these strike and shake each other by clashing together as chance may guide them, is it lawful for us to grant also that atoms thus meeting in fortuitous concourse can so make anything as to fashion its distinctive forms, determine its figure, polish its surface, enliven it with color, or quicken it by imparting to it a spirit?&mdash; all which things every one sees to be accomplished in no other way than by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if only he loves to see with the mind rather than with the eye alone, and asks this faculty of intelligent perception from the Author of his being. Nay, more; we are not at liberty even to grant the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of atoms themselves, for, without discussing the subtle theories of the learned as to the divisibility of matter, observe how easily the absurdity of atoms may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> from their own opinions. For they, as is well known, affirm that there is nothing else in nature but bodies and empty space, and the accidents of these, by which I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they mean motion and striking, and the forms which result from these. Let them tell us, then, under which category they reckon the images which they suppose to flow from the more solid bodies, but which, if indeed they are bodies, possess so little solidity that they are not discernible except by their contact with the eyes when we see them, and with the mind when we think of them. For the opinion of these <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> is, that these images can proceed from the material object and come to the eyes or to the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which, nevertheless, they affirm to be material. Now, I ask, do these images flow from atoms themselves? If they do, how can these be atoms from which some bodily particles are in this process separated? If they do not, either something can be the object of thought without such images, which they vehemently deny, or we ask, whence have they acquired a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of atoms, seeing that they can in nowise become objects of thought to us? But I blush to have even thus far refuted these opinions, although they did not blush to hold them. When, however, I consider that they have even dared to defend them, I blush not on their account, but for the race of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> itself whose ears could tolerate such nonsense.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>32. Wherefore, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are, through the pollution of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, so blinded that even these monstrous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> could waste in discussion concerning them the leisure of learned men, will you, Dioscorus, or will any man of an servant <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, hesitate to affirm that in no way could better provision have been made for the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> than that a Man, assumed into ineffable and miraculous union by the Truth Himself, and being the manifestation of His Person on the earth, should by perfect teaching and divine acts move men to saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in that which could not as yet be intellectually apprehended? To the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Him who has done this we give our service; and we exhort you to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> immoveably and steadfastly in Him through whom it has come to pass that not a select few, but whole peoples, unable to discern these things by reason, do accept them in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, until, upheld by instruction in saving <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they escape from these perplexities into the atmosphere of perfectly pure and simple <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. It becomes us, moreover, to yield submission to His authority all the more unreservedly, when we see that in our day no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> dares to lift up itself to rally round it the uninstructed crowd without seeking the shelter of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, and that of all who, belonging to an earlier age, now remain outside of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, those alone continue to have in their obscure assemblies a considerable attendance who retain the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> by which, however they may pretend not to see or understand it, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself was <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> announced. Moreover, those who, though they are not within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity and communion, boast of the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, are compelled to oppose them that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and presume to mislead the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> by a pretence of appealing to reason, since the Lord came with this remedy above all others, that He enjoined on the nations the duty of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But they are compelled, as I have said, to adopt this policy because they feel themselves most miserably overthrown if their authority is compared with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authority. They attempt, accordingly, to prevail against the firmly-settled authority of the immoveable Church by the name and the promises of a pretended appeal to reason. This kind of effrontery is, we may say, characteristic of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But He who is the most merciful Lord of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has both secured the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the citadel of authority by most famous &oelig;cumenical Councils and the Apostolic sees themselves, and furnished her with the abundant armour of equally invincible reason by means of a few men of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> erudition and unfeigned spirituality. The perfection of method in training <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> is, that those who are weak be encouraged to the utmost to enter the citadel of authority, in order that when they have been safely placed there, the conflict necessary for their defence may be maintained with the most strenuous use of reason.</p>

<p>33. The Platonists, however, who, amidst the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of false philosophies assailing them at that time on all sides, rather concealed their own doctrine to be searched for than brought it into the light to be vilified, as they had no divine personage to command <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, began to exhibit and unfold the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> after the name of Christ had become widely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the wondering and troubled kingdoms of this world. Then flourished at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> the school of Plotinus, which had as scholars many men of great acuteness and ability. But some of them were corrupted by curious inquiries into magic, and others, recognising in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> the impersonation of that essential and immutable Truth and Wisdom which they were endeavouring to reach, passed into His service. Thus the whole supremacy of authority and light of reason for regenerating and reforming the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> has been made to reside in the one saving Name, and in His one Church.</p>

<p>34. I do not at all regret that I have stated these things at great length in this letter, although perhaps you would have preferred that I had taken another course; for the more progress that you make in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the more will you approve what I have written, and you will then approve of my counsel, though now you do not think it helpful to your studies. At the same time, I have, to the best of my ability, given answers to your questions&mdash;to some of them in this letter, and to almost all the rest by brief annotations on the parchments on which you had sent them. If in these answers you think I have done too little, or done something else than you expected, you do not duly consider, my Dioscorus, to whom you addressed your questions. I have passed without reply all the questions concerning the orator and the books of Cicero de Oratore. I would have seemed to myself a contemptible trifler if I had entered on the exposition of these topics. For I might with propriety be questioned on all the other subjects, if any one desired me to handle and expound them, not in connection with the works of Cicero, but by themselves; but in these questions the subjects themselves are not in harmony with my profession now. I would not, however, have done all that I have done in this letter had I not removed from Hippo for a time after the illness under which I laboured when your messenger came to me. Even in these days I have been visited again with interruption of health and with fever, on which account there has been more delay than might otherwise have been in sending these to you. I earnestly beg you to write and let me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how you receive them.</p>
