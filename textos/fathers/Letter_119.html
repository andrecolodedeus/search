<h1>Letter 119</h1>

<p> <em>To Anatolius the Patrician</em>. </p>

<p>Your excellency has been fully informed as to the acts of the most righteous judges at Ephesus, for their sound has gone out into all lands and their most just judgment to the ends of the world.  What church has not felt the storm that has been raised by it? The one side wronged, the other were wronged, but they who neither suffered nor did the wrong share the distress of the wronged, and lament over them that so savagely and against all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and divine massacred their own members. Even house breakers caught in the very act are first tried and then punished by their judges; even murderers, violators of sepulchres, and adulterers, are first haled before the bench, and their accusers ordered to make their indictment, and the motive of the witnesses is tested to see that they are not giving evidence to curry favour with the prosecutors, or are prejudiced against the defendants; and after this they are bidden to make their defence to the charges brought against them. This is done twice, thrice; sometimes even four times; and then, and not till then, after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been sought in the words of both accuser and accused, the sentence is given. As to how these men judged in the case of the rest I will say nothing, lest I may seem a meddler in what does not concern me. I am forced to speak on behalf of myself alone, for the unrighteous deed of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> compels me. The imperial order kept me at home, and prevented me from travelling beyond the bounds of the city placed under my pastoral care. The decision of the synod went against me, and a man was condemned who was five and thirty days' journey away.</p>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all said to the patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> about <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>: <q>Because the cry of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> is very great and because their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is very grievous; I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which has come unto me; and if not, I will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</q>  He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> quite well the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of those men, and nevertheless He said, <q>I will go down and see,</q> so teaching us to wait for the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of facts. But these men never summoned me to trial, they never heard the sound of my voice, they refused to hear from me a statement of my opinions, and handed me over, as a victim to be slaughtered, to the rage of the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>I, however, welcome my rest, and especially so at the present time, when the apostolic decrees have been by many destroyed, and the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> strengthened. But lest any one who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> me should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> uttered against me are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and should be scandalized at the idea of my holding opinions other than those of the gospel, I implore your excellency to ask as a favour from the victorious sovereign that I may go to the West, and there plead my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> before the very godly and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and if I be found transgressing in the least degree the rule of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that I may be plunged into the midst of the deep sea. If he will not grant you this request, let him at least command me to inhabit my <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>,  which is a hundred and twenty miles away from Cyrus, seventy-five from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and lies three miles away from Apamea.</p>

<p>Of these petitions, if possible, I ask the former; if not at least I implore that, through your excellency's interposition, the second may be granted me. I shall ever carry the memory of your kindness in my heart and on my lips, supplicating the Lord of hosts to requite your excellency as well with present as with future blessings. I am compelled to write to you in these terms because I have heard that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are endeavouring to compass my removal from this place.</p>
