<h1>Letter 119</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Eustathius, Bishop of Sebasteia</em>. </p>

<p>I address you by the very <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and reverend brother Petrus, beseeching you now and ever to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me, that I may be changed from ways dangerous and to be shunned, and may be made one day worthy of the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Though I say nothing, you will converse together about my affairs, and he will give you an exact account of what has taken place. But you admit without due examination, the vile suspicions against me which will probably be raised by men who have insulted me, in violation of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the regard of men. I am ashamed to tell you what treatment I have received from the illustrious Basilius, whom I had accepted at the hands of your reverence as a protection for my life. But, when you have heard what our brother has to say, you will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> every detail. I do not thus speak to avenge myself upon him, for I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that it may not be put to his account by the Lord, but in order that your affection to me may remain firm, and because I am afraid lest it be shaken by the monstrous <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> which these men are pretty sure to make up in defence of their fall. Whatever be the charges they adduce, I hope your intelligence will put these enquiries to them. Have they formally accused me? Have they sought for any correction of the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which they bring against me? Have they made their grievance against me plain? As matters are, by their ignoble flight they have made it evident that under the cheerfulness of their countenance, and their counterfeit expressions of affection, they are all the while hiding in their heart an immense depth of guile and of gall. In all this, whether I narrate it or not, your intelligence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> perfectly well what sorrow they have caused me, and what laughter to those who, always expressing their abomination for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> life in this wretched city, affirm that the pretence of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is practised as a mere trick to get credit, a mere assumption to deceive. So in these days no mode of life is now so suspected of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> by people here as the profession of <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>. Your intelligence will consider what is the best cure for all this.</p>

<p>As to the charges patched up against me by Sophronius, far from being a prelude of blessings, they are a beginning of division and separation, and are likely to lead to even my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> growing cold. I implore that by your merciful kindness he may be withheld from his injurious efforts, and that your affection may strive rather to tighten the bonds of what is falling asunder, and not to increase separation by joining with those who are eager for dissent.</p>
