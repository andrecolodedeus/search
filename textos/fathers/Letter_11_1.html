<h1>Letter 11</h1>

<p> <em>For 339. Coss. Constantius Augustus II, Constans I; Pr&aelig;fect, Philagrius the Cappadocian, for the second time; Indict. xii; Easter-day xvii Kal. Mai, xx Pharmuthi; &AElig;ra Dioclet. 55.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, being girt about with every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> , and called faithful of the Lord&mdash; for he was conscious of nothing in himself but what was a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and a praise , or what was in harmony with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and godliness&mdash; clave to these things more and more, and was carried up even to heavenly places, and was borne to Paradise <span class="stiki" id="note284262"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:4</a></span>; to the end that, as he surpassed the conversation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, he should be exalted above men. And when he descended, he preached to every man; 'We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part, and we prophesy in part; here I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part; but then shall I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even as also I am <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284263"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:9,&nbsp;12</a></span>.' For, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, he was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are in heaven, as their fellow-citizen.  And in relation to all that is future and perfect, the things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by him here were in part; but with respect to those things which were committed and entrusted to him by the Lord, he was perfect; as he said, 'We who are perfect, should be thus minded <span class="stiki" id="note284265"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span>.' For as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Christ is the fulfilment and accomplishment of the ministration which was supplied by the law of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, so future things will be the accomplishment of such as now exist, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> being then fulfilled, and the faithful receiving those things which, not seeing now, they yet hope for, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says; 'For what a man sees, why does he also hope for? But if we hope for those things we see [not], we then by patience wait for them <span class="stiki" id="note284266"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24-25</a></span>.' Since then that blessed man was of such a character, and apostolic <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was committed to him, he wrote, wishing 'that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> should be as he was <span class="stiki" id="note284267"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span>.' For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is philanthropic , and great is the company of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, for thousands of thousands and myriads of myriads there serve the Lord. And though a man enters it through a strait and narrow way, yet having entered, he beholds immeasurable space, and a place greater than any other, as they declare, who were eye-witnesses and heirs of these things. 'You placed afflictions before us.' But afterwards, having related their afflictions, they say, 'You brought us forth into a wide place;' and again, 'In affliction You have enlarged us. ' For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, my brethren, the course of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> here is straitened; since they either toil painfully through longing for those things which are to come, as he who said, 'Woe is me that my pilgrimage is prolonged ;' or they are distressed and spent for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of other men, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wrote to the Corinthians, saying, 'Lest, when I come to you, God should <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> me, and I should bewail many of those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> already, and not repented for the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed <span class="stiki" id="note284271"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:21</a></span>.' As Samuel bewailed the destruction of Saul, and Jeremiah wept for the captivity of the people. But after this affliction, and sorrow, and sighing, when they depart from this world, a certain divine <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, and pleasure, and exultation receives them, from which misery and sorrow, and sighing, flee away.</p>

<p>2. Since we are thus circumstanced, my brethren, let us never loiter in the path of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; for hereto he counsels us, saying, 'Be followers of me, as I also am of Christ <span class="stiki" id="note284272"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:1</a></span>.' For he gave this advice not to the Corinthians only, since he was not their Apostle only, but being 'a teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and verity <span class="stiki" id="note284273"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:7</a></span>,' he admonished us all through them; and in short, the things he wrote to each particular person are commandments common to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.  On this account in writing to different people, some he exhorted as, for instance, in the Epistles to the Romans, and the Ephesians, and Philemon. Some he reproved, and was indignant with them, as in the case of the Corinthians and Galatians. To some he gave advice, as to the Colossians and Thessalonians. The Philippians he approved of, and rejoiced in them. The Hebrews he taught that the law was a shadow to them.  But to his elect sons, Timothy and Titus, when they were near, he gave instruction; when far away, he put them in remembrance. For he was all things to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; and being himself a perfect man, he adapted his teaching to the need of every one, so that by all means he might rescue some of them. Therefore his word was not without fruit; but in every place it is planted and productive even to this day.</p>

<p>3. And wherefore, my beloved? For it is right that we should search into the apostolic mind. Not only in the beginning of the Epistles, but towards their close, and in the middle of them, he used persuasions and admonitions. I hope therefore that, by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I shall in no respect <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> represent the plan of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man. As he was well skilled in these divine matters, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the power of the divine teaching, he deemed it necessary, in the first place, to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the word concerning Christ, and the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> regarding Him; and then afterwards to point to the correction of habits, so that when they had learned to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the Lord, they might earnestly desire to do those things which He commanded. For when the Guide to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> is unknown, one does not readily pass on to the observance of them. Faithful <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, adopted this method; for when he promulgated the words of the divine dispensation of <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, he first proclaimed the matters relating to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God: 'Hear, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Lord your God is one Lord <span class="stiki" id="note284276"><a href="../bible/deu006.htm#verse4">Deuteronomy&nbsp;6:4</a></span>.' Afterwards, having shadowed Him forth to the people, and taught of Him in Whom they ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and informed their minds of Him Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he proceeds to lay down the law relating to those things whereby a man may be well-pleasing to Him, saying, 'You shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; you shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>;' together with the other commandments. For also, according to the Apostolic teaching, 'He that draws near to God must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that seek Him <span class="stiki" id="note284277"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;11:6</a></span>.' Now He is sought by means of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says; 'Seek the Lord, and when you have found Him, call upon Him; when He is near to you, let the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> forsake his ways, and the lawless man his thoughts <span class="stiki" id="note284278"><a href="../bible/isa055.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;55:6-7</a></span>.'</p>

<p>4. It will also be well if a man is not offended at the testimony of the Shepherd, saying in the beginning of his book, 'Before all things <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, Who created and established all these things, and from non-<a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> called them into being. ' And, further, the blessed Evangelists&mdash; who recorded the words of the Lord&mdash; in the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, wrote the things concerning our Saviour; so that, having first made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the Lord, the Creator, they might be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> when narrating the events that took place. For how could they have been <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, when writing respecting him who [was blind] from his mother's womb, and those other blind men who recovered their sight, and those who rose from the dead, and the changing of water into wine, and those <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> who were cleansed; if they had not taught of Him as the Creator, writing, 'In the beginning was the Word <span class="stiki" id="note284280"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span>?' Or, according to Matthew, that He Who was born of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, was <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, and the Son of the living God? He from Whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, turn away their faces, but Whom we acknowledge and worship. The Apostle therefore, as was meet, sent to different people, but his own son he especially reminded, 'that he should not despise the things in which he had been instructed by him,' and enjoined on him, 'Remember <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who rose from the dead, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, according to my <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. ' And speaking of these things being delivered to him, to be always had in remembrance, he immediately writes to him, saying, 'Meditate on these things: be engaged in them. <span class="stiki" id="note284282"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:15</a></span> ' For constant meditation, and the remembrance of divine words, strengthens <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and produces a <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to Him inseparable and not merely formal ; as he, being of this <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, speaks about himself and others like-minded, saying boldly, 'Who shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God <span class="stiki" id="note284284"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse35">Romans&nbsp;8:35</a></span>?' For  such men, being confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and possessing an unshaken disposition towards Him, and being one in spirit (for <span class="stiki" id="note284286"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> 'he who is joined to the Spirit is one spirit'), are sure 'as the mount Sion.' and although ten thousand trials may rage against them, they are founded upon a rock, which is Christ.  In Him the careless take no delight; and having no continuous purpose of good, they are sullied by temporal attacks, and esteem nothing more highly than present things, being unstable and deserving reproof as regards the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For 'either the care of this world, or the deceitfulness of riches, chokes them <span class="stiki" id="note284288"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;13:22</a></span>;' or, as Jesus said in that <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> which had reference to them, since they have not established the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that has been preached to them, but continue only for a time, immediately, in time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or when affliction arises through the word, they are offended. Now those who meditate <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> we say, [think] not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> and not righteousness, but iniquity, for their tongue learns to speak lies. They have done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and have not ceased that they might repent. For, persevering with delight in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> actions, they hasten thereto without turning back, even treading under foot the commandment with regard to neighbours, and, instead of loving them, devise <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against them, as the saint testifies, saying, 'And those who seek me <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> have spoken vanity, and imagined deceit all the day. ' But that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of such meditation is none other than the want of instruction, the divine proverb has already declared; 'The son that forsakes the commandment of his father meditates <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> words. ' But such meditation, because it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> blames in these words, and reproves too in other terms, saying, 'Your hands are polluted with blood, your fingers with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; your lips have spoken lawlessness, and your tongue imagines iniquity: no man speaks right things, nor is there <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment <span class="stiki" id="note284291"><a href="../bible/isa059.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;59:3-4</a></span>.' But what the end is of such perverse imagining, He immediately declares, saying, 'They trust in vanities and speak <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>; for they conceive mischief, and bring forth lawlessness. They have hatched the eggs of an asp, and woven a spider's web; and he who is prepared to eat of their eggs, when he breaks them finds gall, and a basilisk therein. ' Again, what the hope of such is, He has already announced. 'Because righteousness does not overtake them, when they waited for light, they had darkness; when they waited for brightness, they walked in a thick cloud. They shall grope for the wall like the blind, and as those who have no eyes shall they grope; they shall fall at noon-day as at midnight; when dead, they shall groan. They shall roar together as a bear, or as a dove. '</p>

<p>This is the fruit of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, these rewards are given to its familiars, for perverseness does not deliver its own. But in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, against them it sets itself, and it tears them first, and on them especially it summons ruin. Woe to them against whom these are brought; for 'it is sharper than a two-edged sword <span class="stiki" id="note284294"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;4:12</a></span>,' slaying beforehand and very swiftly those who will lay hold of it. For their tongue, according to the testimony of the Psalmist, is a 'sharp sword, and their teeth spears and arrows. ' But the wonderful part is that while often he against whom men <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> [harm] suffers nothing, they are pierced by their own spears: for they possess, even in themselves, before they reach others, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, guile, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, bitterness. Although they may not be able to bring these upon others, they immediately return upon and against themselves, as he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, saying, 'Let their sword enter into their own heart.' There is also such a proverb as this: 'The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is held fast by the chain of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. '</p>

<p>5. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in their imaginings, and in their agreeing to act <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> against the Lord, forgot that they were bringing <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon themselves. Therefore does the Word lament for them, saying, 'Why do the people exalt themselves, and the nations <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> vain things ?' For vain indeed was the imagination of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, meditating death against the Life , and devising unreasonable things against the 'Word of the Father. ' For who that looks upon their dispersion, and the desolation of their city, may not aptly say, 'Woe unto them, for they have imagined an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> imagination, saying against their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, let us bind the righteous man, because he is not pleasing to us. ' And full well is it so, my brethren; for when they erred concerning the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that 'he who digs a pit for his neighbour falls therein; and he who destroys a hedge, a serpent shall bite him <span class="stiki" id="note284301"><a href="../bible/ecc010.htm#verse8">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;10:8</a></span>.' And if they had not turned their faces from the Lord, they would have feared what was written before in the divine Psalms: 'The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> are caught in the pit which they made; in the snare which they hid is their own foot taken. The Lord is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> when executing judgments: by the works of his hands is the sinner taken. ' Let them observe this, and how that 'the snare they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not shall come upon them, and the net they hid take them. ' But they understood not these things, for had they done so, 'they would not have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284304"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span>.'</p>

<p>6. Therefore the righteous and faithful servants of the Lord, who 'are made <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and bring forth from it things new and old;' and who 'meditate on the words of the Lord, when sitting in the house, when lying down or rising up, and when walking by the way ;'&mdash; since they are of good hope because of the promise of the Spirit which said, 'Blessed is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of corrupters; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law does he meditate day and night ;'&mdash; being grounded in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, rejoicing in hope, fervent in spirit, they have boldness to say, 'My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.' And again, 'I have meditated on all Your works, and on the work of Your hands has been my meditation.' And, 'If I have remembered You on my bed, and in the morning have meditated on You. ' Afterwards, advancing in boldness, they say, 'The meditation of my heart is before You at all times. ' And what is the end of such an one? He cites immediately; 'The Lord is my Helper and my Redeemer. ' For to those who thus examine themselves, and conform their hearts to the Lord, nothing adverse shall happen; for indeed, their heart is strengthened by confidence in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, as it is written, 'They who trust in the Lord are as mount Sion: he who dwells in Jerusalem shall not be moved for ever. ' For if at any time, the crafty one shall be presumptuously bold against them, chiefly that he may break the rank of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a division among brethren; even in this the Lord is with them, not only as an avenger on their behalf, but also when they have already been beaten, as a deliverer for them. For this is the divine promise; 'The Lord shall fight for you <span class="stiki" id="note284311"><a href="../bible/exo014.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;14:14</a></span>.' Henceforth, although afflictions and trials from without overtake them, yet, being fashioned after the apostolic words, and 'being steadfast in tribulations, and persevering in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284312"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;12:12</a></span> ' and in meditation on the law, they stand against those things which befall them, are well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and give utterance to the words which are written, 'Afflictions and distresses have come upon me; but Your commandments are my meditation. '</p>

<p>7. And whereas, not only in action, but also in the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, men are moved to <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he afterwards adds, saying, 'My eyes prevent the dawn, that I might meditate on Your words. ' For it is meet that the spiritual meditations of those who are whole should precede their bodily actions. And does not our Saviour, when intending to teach this very thing begin with the thoughts of the mind? Saying, 'Whosoever looks on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her, has already committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>:' and, 'Whosoever shall be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother, is guilty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. ' For where there is no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> is prevented; and where <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is first removed, there can be no accusation of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Hence meditation on the law is necessary, my beloved, and uninterrupted converse with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, 'that the saint may lack nothing, but be perfect to every good work <span class="stiki" id="note284316"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:17</a></span>.' For by these things is the promise of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wrote to Timothy, calling constant meditation exercise, and saying, 'Exercise yourself unto godliness; for bodily exercise profits little; but godliness is profitable for all things, since it has the promise of the present life, and of that which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284317"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:7-8</a></span>.'</p>

<p>8. Worthy of admiration is the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of that man, my brethren! For through Timothy he enjoins upon all , that they should have regard to nothing more than to godliness, but above everything to adjudge the chief place to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For what <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has the unrighteous man, though he may feign to keep the commandments? Nay rather, the unrighteous man is unable even to keep a portion of the law, for as is his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, such of necessity must be his actions; as the Spirit says, reproving such; 'The fool has said in his heart, there is no God.' After this the Word, showing that actions correspond with thoughts, says, 'They are corrupt; they are profane in their machinations. ' The unrighteous man then, in every respect corrupts his body; stealing, committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, cursing, being drunken, and doing such like things. Even as Jeremiah, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, convicts <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> of these things, crying out and saying, 'Oh, that I had a lodge far off in the wilderness! Then would I leave my people and depart from them: for they are all adulterers, an assembly of oppressors, who draw out their tongue as a bow; lying and not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has prevailed upon the earth, and they proceed from iniquities to iniquities; but Me they have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284320"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse2">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:2</a></span>.' Thus, for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and for <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, in which they [proceed] from iniquity to iniquity, he reproves their practices; but, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not the Lord, and were faithless, he charges them with unrighteousness.</p>

<p>9. For <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and godliness are allied to each other, and sisters; and he who believes in Him is godly, and he also who is godly, believes the more.  He therefore who is in a state of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, undoubtedly also wanders from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and he who falls from godliness, falls from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, for instance, bearing testimony to the same point, advises his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, saying, 'Avoid profane conversations; for they increase unto more ungodliness, and their word takes hold as does a canker, of whom are Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus <span class="stiki" id="note284322"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:16-17</a></span>.' In what their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> consisted he declares, saying, 'Who have erred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, saying that the resurrection is already past. ' But again, desirous of showing that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is yoked with godliness, the Apostle says, 'And all those who will live godly in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> shall suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. ' Afterwards, that no man should renounce godliness through <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he counsels them to preserve the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, adding, 'You, therefore, continue in the things you have learned, and hast been assured of. ' And as when brother is helped by brother, they become as a wall to each other; so <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and godliness, being of like growth, hang together, and he who is practised in the one, of necessity is strengthened by the other. Therefore, wishing the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> to be exercised in godliness unto the end, and to contend for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he counsels them, saying, 'Fight the good fight of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and lay hold on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life <span class="stiki" id="note284326"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:7</a></span>.' For if a man first put away the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and rightly confesses Him Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he next fights by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with those who <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against Him.</p>

<p>10. For of these two things we speak of&mdash; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and godliness&mdash; the hope is the same, even everlasting life; for he says, 'Fight the good fight of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; lay hold on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.' And, 'exercise yourself unto godliness, for it has the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come <span class="stiki" id="note284327"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:7-8</a></span>.' For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the Ario-maniacs, who now have gone out from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, being opponents of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have dug a pit of unbelief, into which they themselves have been thrust; and, since they have advanced in ungodliness, they 'overthrow the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the simple <span class="stiki" id="note284328"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;16:18</a></span>;' <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, and saying that He is a creature, and has His being from things which are not. But as then against the adherents of Philetus and Hymen&aelig;us, so now the Apostle forewarns all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> against ungodliness like theirs, saying, 'The foundation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stands sure, having this seal, The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His; and, Let every one that names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity <span class="stiki" id="note284329"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:19</a></span>.' For it is well that a man should depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of iniquity, that he may be able properly to celebrate the feast; for he who is defiled with the pollutions of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> is not able to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> to the Lord our God. Hence, the people who were then in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> said, 'We cannot <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to the Lord our God <span class="stiki" id="note284330"><a href="../bible/exo008.htm#verse26">Exodus&nbsp;8:26</a></span>.' For <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is over all, willed that they should go far away from the servants of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, and from the furnace of iron; so that being set free from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and having carefully put away from them all strange notions, they might receive the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> actions. For He says, 'Go far from them: depart from the midst of them, and touch not the unclean things <span class="stiki" id="note284331"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:17</a></span>.' For a man will not otherwise depart from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and lay hold on <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, than by meditation on his acts; and when he has been practised by exercise in godliness, he will lay hold on the confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> , which also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, after he had fought the fight, possessed, namely, the crown of righteousness which was laid up; which the righteous Judge will give, not to him alone, but to all who are like him.</p>

<p>11. For such meditation and exercise in godliness, being at all times the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, is urgent on us at the present time, when the divine word desires us to keep the feast with them if we are in this disposition. For what else is the feast, but the constant worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the recognition of godliness, and unceasing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> from the whole heart with agreement? So <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wishing us to be ever in this disposition, commands, saying, 'Rejoice evermore; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing; in everything give thanks. ' Not therefore separately, but unitedly and collectively, let us all keep the feast together, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> exhorts, saying, 'O come, let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord; let us make a joyful noise unto God our Saviour. ' Who then is so negligent, or who so disobedient to the divine voice, as not to leave everything, and run to the general and common assembly of the feast? Which is not in one place only, for not one place alone keeps the feast; but 'into all the earth their song has gone forth, and to the ends of the world their words.' And the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is not offered in one place, but 'in every nation, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is offered unto God. ' So when in like manner from all in every place, praise and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall ascend to the gracious and good Father, when the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is in every place, with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> and rejoicing, celebrates together the same worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in common send up a song of praise and say, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> ; how blessed will it not be, my brethren! Who will not, at that time, be engaged, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> rightly? For the walls of every adverse power, yea even of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> especially, falling down, and the gift  of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> being then richly poured upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, every man perceiving the coming of the Spirit shall say, 'We are all filled in the morning with Your favour, and we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and are made glad in our days. '</p>

<p>12. Since this is so, let us make a joyful noise with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and let no one of us fail of his duty in these things; counting as nothing the affliction or the trials which, especially at this time, have been enviously directed against us by the party of Eusebius. Even now they wish to injure us, and by their accusations to compass our death, because of that godliness, whose helper is the Lord. But, as faithful servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that He is our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the time of trouble:&mdash; for our Lord promised beforehand, saying, 'Blessed are you when men revile you and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, and say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for your reward is great in heaven <span class="stiki" id="note284339"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;5:11-12</a></span>.' Again, it is the Redeemer's own word, that affliction shall not befall every man in this world, but only those who have a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Him:&mdash; on this account, the more the enemies hem us in, the more let us be at liberty; although they revile us, let us come together; and the more they would turn us aside from godliness, let us the more boldly preach it saying, 'All these things have come upon us, yet have we not forgotten You ,' and we have not done <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with the Ario-maniacs, who say that You have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from those things that exist not. The Word which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is also from Him.</p>

<p>13. Let us therefore keep the feast, my brethren, celebrating it not at all as an occasion of distress and mourning, neither let us mingle with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> through temporal trials brought upon us by godliness. But if anything that would promote <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> should offer, let us attend to it; so that our heart may not be sad, like that of Cain; but that, like faithful and good servants of the Lord, we may hear the words, 'Enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your Lord <span class="stiki" id="note284341"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;25:21</a></span>.' For we do not institute days of mourning and sorrow, as some may consider these of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> to be, but we keep the feast, being filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. We keep it then, not regarding it after the deceitful <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, nor according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, which takes away the Son from the Godhead, and numbers Him among creatures; but we look to the correct doctrine we derive from the Lord. For the guile of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and the unbounded impiety of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> nothing but sad reflections, for the former at the beginning slew the Lord; but these latter take away His position of having conquered that death to which the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> brought Him, in that they say He is not the Creator, but a creature. For if He were a creature, He would have been holden by death; but if He was not holden by death, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, He is not a creature, but the Lord of the creatures, and the subject  of this <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> feast.</p>

<p>14. For the Lord of death would abolish death, and being Lord, what He would was accomplished; for we have all passed from death unto life. But the imagination of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and of those who are like them, was vain, since the result was not such as they contemplated, but turned out adverse to themselves; and 'at both of them He that sits in the heaven shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. ' Hence, when our Saviour was led to death, He restrained the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who followed Him weeping, saying, 'Weep not for Me <span class="stiki" id="note284344"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;23:28</a></span>;' meaning to show that the Lord's death is an event, not of sorrow but of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and that He Who dies for us is alive. For He does not derive His being from those things which are not, but from the Father. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a subject of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that we can see the signs of victory against death, even our own incorruptibility, through the body of the Lord. For since He rose gloriously, it is clear that the resurrection of all of us will take place; and since His body remained without corruption, there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> regarding our incorruption.  For as by one man <span class="stiki" id="note284346"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;5:12</a></span>, as says <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> (and it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>), <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, so by the resurrection of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, we shall all rise. 'For,' he says, 'this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284347"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span>.' Now this came to pass in the time of the Passion, in which our Lord died for us, for 'our <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, Christ, is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>. ' Therefore, because He was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, let each of us feed upon Him, and with alacrity and diligence partake of His sustenance; since He is given to all without grudging, and is in every one 'a well of water flowing to everlasting life <span class="stiki" id="note284349"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span>.'</p>

<p>15. We begin the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">fast of forty days</a> on the ninth of the month Phamenoth <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar005.htm">Mark 5</a></span>; and having, in these days, served the Lord with abstinence, and first purified ourselves , we commence also the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">holy Easter</a> on the fourteenth of the month Pharmuthi (April 9). Afterwards, extending the fast to the seventh day, on the seventeenth  of the month, let us rest late in the evening. And the light of the Lord having first dawned upon us, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Sunday on which our Lord rose shining upon us, we should <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be glad with the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which arises from good works, during the seven weeks which remain&mdash; to Pentecost&mdash; giving <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and saying, 'This is the day which the Lord has made: we will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be glad in it, ' through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, through Whom to the same, and to His Father, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. All the brethren who are with me salute you. That you may have health in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, brethren beloved.</p>
