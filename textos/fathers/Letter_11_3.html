<h1>Letter 11</h1>

<p><strong>To the Virgins of &AElig;mona</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">&AElig;mona was a Roman colony not far from Stridon, Jerome's birthplace. The <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to whom the note is addressed had omitted to answer his letters, and he now writes to upbraid them for their remissness. The date of the letter is 374 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>This scanty sheet of paper shows in what a wilderness I live, and because of it I have to say much in few words. For, desirous though I am to speak to you more fully, this miserable scrap compels me to leave much unsaid. Still ingenuity makes up for lack of means, and by writing small I can say a great deal. Observe, I beseech you, how I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, even in the midst of my difficulties, since even the want of materials does not stop me from writing to you.</p>

<p>Pardon, I beseech you, an aggrieved man: if I speak in tears and in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> it is because I have been injured. For in return for my regular letters you have not sent me a single syllable. Light, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, has no communion with darkness, <span class="stiki" id="note300142"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> and God's handmaidens no fellowship with a sinner, yet a harlot was allowed to wash the Lord's feet with her tears,  and dogs are permitted to eat of their masters' crumbs. <span class="stiki" id="note300144"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;15:27</a></span> It was the Saviour's mission to call sinners and not the righteous; for, as He said Himself, <q>they that be whole need not a physician.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300145"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;9:12-13</a></span> He wills the repentance of a sinner rather than his death, <span class="stiki" id="note300146"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:11</a></span> and carries home the poor stray sheep on His own shoulders. <span class="stiki" id="note300147"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;15:5</a></span> So, too, when the prodigal son returns, his father receives him with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300148"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;15:20</a></span> Nay more, the apostle says: <q>Judge nothing before the time.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300149"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> For <q>who are you that judgest another man's servant? To his own master he stands or falls.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300150"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;14:4</a></span> And <q>let him that stands take heed lest he fall.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300151"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:12</a></span> <q>Bear ye one another's burdens.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300152"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse2">Galatians&nbsp;6:2</a></span> </p>

<p>Dear sisters, man's <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> judges in one way, Christ in another; and the whisper of a corner is not the same as the sentence of His tribunal. Many ways seem right to men which are afterwards found to be wrong. <span class="stiki" id="note300153"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;14:12</a></span> And a treasure is often stowed in earthen vessels. <span class="stiki" id="note300154"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> Peter thrice denied his Lord, yet his bitter tears restored him to his place. <q>To whom much is forgiven, the same loves much.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300155"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;7:47</a></span> No word is said of the flock as a whole, yet the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven over the safety of one sick ewe. <span class="stiki" id="note300156"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;15:7,&nbsp;10</a></span> And if any one demurs to this reasoning, the Lord Himself has said: <q>Friend, is your eye <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because I am good?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300157"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;20:15</a></span> </p>
