<h1>Letter 12</h1>

<p> <em>To the Bishop <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>.</em> </p>

<p>Job, that famous tower of adamant and noble champion of goodness, was not shaken even by blows of continuous troubles of every sort and kind, but stood impregnable and firm. At the end however of all his trials the righteous Law-giver explained the reason of them in the words, <q>Do you think that I answered you for any other reason than that you might appear just?</q>  I think that these words are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which is able to support the many and various attacks of troubles and anxieties, and so far from shrinking from them, exhibits the strength and stability of your administration. So the bountiful Lord, seeing the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, has refused to keep a worthy champion in concealment, and has brought him forth to the contest to adorn your venerable head with a crown of victory, and give your struggles as a high example of good service to the rest. So, my dear friend, conquer in this battle too, and bear bravely the death of your son-in-law, my own dear friend. Conquer in your wisdom the claims of kinsmanship and the memory of a noble and generous character, a memory which must always recall something beyond painter's art or rhetorician's skill. Repel the assault of sorrow by the thought of Him who wisely administers all the affairs of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, with perfect <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the future and right guidance of it for our good. Let us join in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of him who has been delivered from this life's storms. Let us rather give thanks because, wafted by kindly winds, he has cast anchor in the windless haven and has escaped the grievous shipwrecks whereof this life is full. But need I say all this to one who is a tried gladiator of goodness? Need I, as it were, anoint for endurance one who is a trainer of other athletes? Still I write. It is a comfort to myself to write as I do. I am really and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> grieved when I remember an intimacy that I esteemed so highly. Once more I praise the great Guide of all, Who both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what would be good for us and guides our life accordingly. I have dictated this after writing my former communication, on one of my friends in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> telling me that the end had come.</p>
