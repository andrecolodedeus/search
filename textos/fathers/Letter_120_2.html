<h1>Letter 120</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Meletius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a></em>. </p>

<p>I have received a letter from the very God-beloved <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Eusebius, in which he enjoins that a second letter be written to the Westerns about certain Church matters. He has expressed a wish that the letter should be drawn up by me, and signed by all those who are in communion. Having no means of writing a letter about these wishes of his, I have sent on his minute to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, in order that, when you have read it and can give heed to the information given by the very dear brother Sanctissimus, our fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, you may yourself be so good as to indite a letter on these points as seems best to you. We are prepared to agree to it and to lose no time in having it conveyed to those in communion with us, so that, when all have signed it may be carried by the messenger, who is on the point of starting on his journey to visit the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the West. Give orders for the decision of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to be communicated to me as quickly as possible, that I may not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of your intentions.</p>

<p>As to the intrigue which is now being devised, or has already been devised against me, in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, the same brother will convey intimation to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, unless indeed the report of what has been done does not anticipate him and make the position clear. There is ground for hope that the threats are coming to an end.</p>

<p>I wish your reverence to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that our brother Anthimus has ordained Faustus, who is living with the pope  as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, without having received the votes, and in place of our right reverend brother Cyril. Thus he has filled Armenia with schisms. I have thought it right to tell your reverence this, lest they should lie against me, and I be responsible for these disorderly proceedings. You will of course deem it right to make this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the rest. I think such irregularity will distress many.</p>
