<h1>Letter 122</h1>

<p> <em>Uranius</em>  <em>Bishop of Emesa.</em></p>

<p>I have been greatly delighted that we who correspond in character should have corresponded by letter. But I do not quite see what you mean by saying <q>Are not these my words?</q> If it were said only for the sake of salutation, I am not annoyed at it; but if it is intended to remind me of the advice which recommended silence, and of the so-called &oelig;conomy,  I am very much <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, but I do not accept the suggestion. For the divine Apostle charges us to take quite the opposite course. <q>Be instant in season and out of season.</q>  And the Lord says to this very spokesman, <q>Be not afraid, but speak</q>  and to Isaiah, <q>Cry aloud, spare not</q>  and to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <q>Go down, charge the people</q>  and to Ezekiel <q>I have made you a watchman unto the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,</q> and it shall be <q>if you warn not the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>,</q>  and the like: for I think it needless to write at length to one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. Not only therefore are we not distressed at having spoken freely, but we even <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and are glad, and laud Him who has thought us worthy of these sufferings; aye and call on my friends to encounter the same perils.</p>

<p>If they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we do not keep the apostolic rule of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but swerve to the right hand or the left, let them <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> us; let them join the opposite side; let them be ranked with them that are at <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with us. But if they bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to our holding the right teaching of the gospel message, we hail them with the cry, <q>Do you too 'stand having your loins girt about with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,...and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,'</q>  and so on, for it is said that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> comprises not only <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, righteousness, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, but also <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and that by means of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> the rest of its component parts are preserved. For righteousness needs the alliance of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in its <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against wrong; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> vanquishes intemperance by the aid of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. And for this reason the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all said to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <q>The just shall live by his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and if any man draw back, my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall have no pleasure in him.</q>  Shrinking he calls cowardice. Hold fast then, my dear friend, to the apostolic doctrines, for <q>He that shall come will come, and will not tarry,</q>  and <q>He shall render to every man according to his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>,</q>  for <q>the fashion of this world passes away,</q>  and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> shall be made manifest.</p>
