<h1>Letter 122</h1>

<p class="c30"> <span class="c1">Letter CXXII. To Rusticus.</span> </p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Rusticus and Artemia his wife having made a vow of continence broke it. Artemia proceeded to Palestine to do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and Rusticus promised to follow her. However he failed to do so, and Jerome was asked to write this letter in the hope that it might induce him to fulfil his promise. The date is about 408 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. I am induced to write to you, a stranger to a stranger, by the entreaties of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> servant of Christ Hedibia  and of my daughter in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> Artemia, once your wife but now no longer your wife but your sister and fellow-servant. Not content with assuring her own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> she has sought yours also, in former days at home and now in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places. She is anxious to emulate the thoughtfulness of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> Andrew and Philip; who after Christ had found them, desired in their turn to find, the one his brother Simon and the other his friend Nathanael. <span class="stiki" id="note303115"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse41">John&nbsp;1:41,&nbsp;45</a></span> To the former of these it was said <q>You are Simon, the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas which is by interpretation a stone;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303116"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse42">John&nbsp;1:42</a></span> while the latter, whose name Nathanael means the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was comforted by Christ's <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to him: <q>behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303117"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse47">John&nbsp;1:47</a></span> So of old <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> <span class="stiki" id="note303118"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse15">Genesis&nbsp;19:15-26</a></span> desired to rescue his wife as well as his two daughters, and refusing to leave blazing <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> until he was himself half-on-fire, tried to lead forth one who was tied and bound by her past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But in her despair she lost her composure, and looking back became a monument of an unbelieving <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note303119"><a href="../bible/wis010.htm#verse7">Wisdom&nbsp;10:7</a></span> Yet, as if to make up for the loss of a single <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> glowing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set free the whole city of Zoar. In fact when he left the dark valleys in which <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> lay and came to the mountains, the sun rose upon him as he entered Zoar or the little City; so-called because the little <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> possessed, though unable to save greater places, was at least able to preserve smaller ones. For one who had gone so far astray as to live in <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a> could not all at once reach the noonland where <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note303120"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse23">James&nbsp;2:23</a></span> entertained God and His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note303121"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;18:1</a></span> (For it was in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> that Joseph fed his brothers, and when the bride speaks to the Bridegroom her cry is: <q>tell me where you feed, where you make your flock to rest at noon.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303122"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse7">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:7</a></span>) Good men have always sorrowed for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others. Samuel of old lamented for Saul <span class="stiki" id="note303123"><a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse35">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;15:35</a></span> because he neglected to treat the ulcers of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> with the balm of penitence. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> wept for the Corinthians <span class="stiki" id="note303124"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:4</a></span> who refused to wash out with their tears the stains of fornication. For the same reason Ezekiel swallowed the book where were written within and without song, and lamentation and woe;  the song in praise of the righteous, the lamentation over the penitent, and the woe for those of whom it is written, <q>When the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man falls into the depths of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, then is he filled with scorn.</q>  It is to these that Isaiah alludes when he says: <q>in that day did the Lord God of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, slaying oxen; and killing sheep, eating flesh</q> and saying, <q>let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303127"><a href="../bible/isa022.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;22:12-13</a></span> Yet of such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> Ezekiel is bidden to speak thus: <q>O thou <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, speak unto the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; Thus ye speak, saying, If our transgressions and our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be upon us, and we pine away in them, how should we then live? Say unto them, As I live, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, I have no pleasure in the death of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>; but that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> turn from his way and live,</q> and again, <q>turn ye, turn ye from your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways; for why will you die, O house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303128"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse10">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:10-11</a></span> Nothing makes God so <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> as when men from despair of better things cleave to those which are worse; and indeed this despair in itself is a sign of unbelief. One who despairs of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> can have no expectation of a judgment to come. For if he dreaded such, he would by doing good works prepare to meet his Judge. Let us hear what God says through Jeremiah, <q>withhold your foot from a rough way and your throat from thirst</q>  and again <q>shall they fall, and not arise? Shall he turn away, and not return?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303130"><a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse4">Jeremiah&nbsp;8:4</a></span> Let us hear also what God says by Isaiah: <q>When you shall turn and bewail yourself, then shall you be saved, and then shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where you have hitherto been.</q>  We do not realize the miseries of sickness till returning health reveals them to us. So <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> serve as a foil to the blessedness of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and light shines more brightly when it is relieved against darkness. Ezekiel uses language like that of the other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> because he is animated by a similar spirit. <q>Repent,</q> he cries, <q>and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby you have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will you die, O house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dies, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303132"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse30">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:30-32</a></span> Wherefore in a subsequent passage he says: <q>As I live, says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, I have no pleasure in the death of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: but that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> turn from his way and live.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303133"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:11</a></span> These words show us that the mind must not through disbelief in the promised blessings give way to despair; and that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> once marked out for perdition must not refuse to apply remedies on the ground that its wounds are past curing. Ezekiel describes God as swearing, that if we refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His promise in regard to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> we may at least <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> His <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. It is with full confidence that the righteous man <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> and says, <q>Turn us, O God of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> toward us to cease,</q>  and again, <q>Lord, by your favour you have made my mountain to stand strong: you hid your face and I was troubled.</q>  He means to say, <q>when I forsook the foulness of my faults for the beauty of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, God strengthened my weakness with His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q> Lo, I hear His promise: <q>I will pursue mine enemies and overtake them: neither will I turn again till they are consumed,</q>  so that I who was once your enemy and a fugitive from you, shall be laid hold of by your hand. Cease not from pursuing me till my <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is consumed, and I return to my old husband who will give me my wool and my flax, my oil and my fine flour and will feed me with the richest foods. <span class="stiki" id="note303137"><a href="../bible/hos002.htm#verse7">Hosea&nbsp;2:7-9</a></span> He it was who hedged up and enclosed my <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways <span class="stiki" id="note303138"><a href="../bible/hos002.htm#verse6">Hosea&nbsp;2:6</a></span> that I might find Him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> way who says in the gospel, <q>I am the way, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303139"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> Hear the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>they that sow in tears shall reap in <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. He that goes forth and weeps, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.</q>  Say also with him: <q>All the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears</q> : and again, <q>As the hart pants after the water brooks, so pants my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after you, O God. My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> thirsts for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? My tears have been my meat day and night,</q>  and in another place, <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you are my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; early will I seek you: my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> thirsts for you, my flesh longs for you in a dry and weary land where no water is. So have I looked upon you in the sanctuary.</q>  For although my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has thirsted after you, yet much more have I sought you by the labour of my flesh and have not been able to look upon you in your sanctuary; not at any rate till I have first dwelt in a land barren of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, where the weary wayfarer is no more assailed by the adversary, and where there are no pools or rivers of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>.</p>

<p>The Saviour also wept over the city of Jerusalem because its inhabitants had not repented; <span class="stiki" id="note303144"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;19:41</a></span> and Peter washed out his triple denial with bitter tears, <span class="stiki" id="note303145"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse62">Luke&nbsp;22:62</a></span> thus fulfilling the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>rivers of waters run down my eyes.</q>  Jeremiah too laments over his impenitent people, saying: <q>Oh that my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for...my people!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303147"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse1">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:1</a></span> And farther on he gives a reason for his lamentation: <q>weep ye not for the dead,</q> he writes, <q>neither bemoan him: but weep sore for him that goes away: for he shall return no more.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303148"><a href="../bible/jer022.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;22:10</a></span> The Jew and the Gentile therefore are not to be bemoaned, for they have never been in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and have died once for all (it is of these that the Saviour says: <q>let the dead bury their dead</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303149"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;8:22</a></span>); weep rather for those who by reason of their crimes and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> go away from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and who suffering condemnation for their faults shall no more return to it. It is in this sense that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> speaks to ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, calling them its walls and towers, and saying to each in turn, <q>O wall, let tears run down.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303150"><a href="../bible/lam002.htm#verse18">Lamentations&nbsp;2:18</a></span> In this way, it is <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophetically</a> implied, you will fulfil the apostolic precept: <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with them that do <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and weep with them that weep,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303151"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;12:15</a></span> and by your tears you will melt the hard hearts of sinners till they too weep; whereas, if they persist in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doing they will find these words applied to them, <q>I...planted you a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303152"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse21">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:21</a></span> and again <q>saying to a stock, You are my father; and to a stone, You have brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303153"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse27">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:27</a></span> He means, they would not turn towards God in penitence; but in the hardness of their hearts turned their backs upon Him to insult Him. Wherefore also the Lord says to Jeremiah: <q>have you seen that which backsliding <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has done? She is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot. And I said after she</q> had played the harlot and <q>had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303154"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse6">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:6-7</a></span> </p>

<p>2. How hard hearted we are and how merciful God is! Who even after our many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> urges us to seek <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Yet not even so are we willing to turn to better things. Hear the words of the Lord: <q>If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's and shall afterwards desire to return to him, will he at all receive her? Will he not loathe her rather? But you have played the harlot with many lovers: yet return again to me, says the Lord.</q> In place of the last clause the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Hebrew text (which is not preserved in the Greek and Latin versions) gives the following: <q>you have forsaken me, yet return, and I will receive you, says the Lord.</q>  Isaiah also speaking in the same sense uses almost the same words: <q>Return,</q> he cries, <q>O children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, you who think deep counsel and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.  Return thou unto me and I will redeem you. I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is no God else beside me; a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> God and a Saviour; there is none beside me. Look unto me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth. <span class="stiki" id="note303157"><a href="../bible/isa045.htm#verse21">Isaiah&nbsp;45:21-22</a></span> Remember this and show yourselves men: bring it again to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, O you transgressors. Return in heart and remember the former things of old: for I am God and there is none else.</q>  Joel also writes: <q>turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and with weeping and with mourning: and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for he is gracious and merciful...and <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a> him of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303159"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse12">Joel&nbsp;2:12-13</a></span> How great His mercy is and how excessive&mdash; if I may so say&mdash; and unspeakable is His pitifulness, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Hosea tells us when he speaks in the Lord's name: <q>how shall I give you up, Ephraim? How shall I deliver you, <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? How shall I make you as Admah? How shall I set you as Zeboim? Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceness of mine <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303160"><a href="../bible/hos011.htm#verse8">Hosea&nbsp;11:8-9</a></span> David also says in a psalm: <q>in death there is no remembrance of you; in the grave who shall give you thanks?</q>  and in another place: <q>I acknowledged my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto you, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and you forgave the iniquity of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For this shall every one that is godly <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> unto you in a time when you may be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come near unto him.</q> </p>

<p>3. Think how great that weeping must be which deserves to be compared to a flood of waters. Whosoever so weeps and says with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah <q>let not the apple of my eye cease</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303163"><a href="../bible/lam002.htm#verse18">Lamentations&nbsp;2:18</a></span> shall straightway find the words fulfilled of him: <q>mercy and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each other;</q>  so that, if righteousness and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> terrify him, mercy and peace may encourage him to seek <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>The whole repentance of a sinner is exhibited to us in the fifty-first  psalm written by David after he had gone in unto Bathsheba the wife of Uriah the Hittite,  and when, to the rebuke of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Nathan he had replied, <q>I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> Immediately that he confessed his fault he was comforted by the words: <q>the Lord also has put away your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303167"><a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12:13</a></span> He had added <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; yet bursting into tears he says: <q>Have mercy upon me, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to your loving kindness: according unto the multitude of your tender mercies blot out my transgressions.</q>  A <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so great needed to find great mercy. Accordingly he goes on to say: <q>Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is ever before me. Against you, you only have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a></q>&mdash; as a king he had no one to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> but God&mdash; <q>and done this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your sight; that you might be justified when you speak and be clear when you judge.</q>  For <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has concluded all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303170"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;11:32</a></span> And such was the progress that David made that he who had once been a sinner and a penitent afterwards became a master able to say: <q>I will teach transgressors your ways; and sinners shall be converted unto you.</q>  For as <q>confession and beauty are before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  so a sinner who confesses his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and says: <q>my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness</q>  loses his foul wounds and is made whole and clean.

<p>The ungodly king Ahab, who shed the blood of Naboth to gain his vineyard, was with <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a>, the partner less of his bed than of his cruelty, severely rebuked by Elijah. <q>Thus says the Lord, have you killed and also taken possession?</q> and again, <q>in the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogs lick your blood, even yours;</q> and <q>the dogs shall eat <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> by the wall of Jezreel.</q>  <q>And it came to pass</q>&mdash; the passage goes on&mdash; <q>when Ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth...and the word of the Lord came to Elijah saying, Because Ahab <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself before me, I will not bring the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in his days.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303176"><a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;21:27-29</a></span> Ahab's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel's</a> were the same; yet because Ahab repented, his punishment was postponed so as to fall upon his sons, while <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a> persisting in her <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> met her doom then and there.</p>

<p>Moreover the Lord tells us in the gospel, <q>the men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303177"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;12:41</a></span> and again He says <q>I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303178"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;9:13</a></span> The lost piece of silver is sought for until it is found in the mire. <span class="stiki" id="note303179"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;15:8-10</a></span> So also the ninety and nine sheep are left in the wilderness, while the shepherd carries home on his shoulders the one sheep which has gone astray. <span class="stiki" id="note303180"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse4">Luke&nbsp;15:4-5</a></span> Wherefore also <q>there is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the presence of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> over one sinner that <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303181"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;15:10</a></span> What a blessed thought it is that heavenly beings <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>!

<p>Hear the words of Ezekiel: <q>as for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303186"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse12">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:12</a></span> The Lord judges every man according as he finds him.

If a sinner repents, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven him not only till seven times but till seventy times seven. <span class="stiki" id="note303188"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;18:21-22</a></span> To whom much is forgiven, the same loves much. <span class="stiki" id="note303189"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;7:47</a></span> The harlot washed with her tears the Saviour's feet and wiped them with her hair; and to her, as a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> gathered from the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, was the declaration made: <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303190"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;7:48</a></span> The self-righteous <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> perished in his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> was saved by his confession. <span class="stiki" id="note303191"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;18:14</a></span> </p>

<p>God makes asseveration by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah: <q>At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, to pull down and to destroy it: if that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I will repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that I thought to do unto them. And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it; if it do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in my sight, that it <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would benefit them.</q> And immediately he adds: <q>Behold, I frame <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> way, and make your ways and your doings good. And they said, there is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303192"><a href="../bible/jer018.htm#verse7">Jeremiah&nbsp;18:7-12</a></span> The righteous Simeon says in the gospel: <q>Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303193"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;2:34</a></span> for the fall, that is, of sinners and for the rising again of the penitent. So the apostle writes to the Corinthians: <q>it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, that one should have his father's wife.

<p><q>There is no man clean from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; even though he has lived but for one day.</q>  And the years of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> life are many in number. <q>The stars are not pure in his sight, <span class="stiki" id="note303197"><a href="../bible/job025.htm#verse5">Job&nbsp;25:5</a></span> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> he charged with folly.</q>  If there is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in heaven, how much more must there be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> on earth? If they are stained with guilt who have no bodily <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, how much more must we be, enveloped as we are in frail flesh and forced to cry each one of us with the apostle: <q>O wretched man that I am!

If any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are called righteous in scripture, and not only righteous but righteous in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are called righteous according to that righteousness mentioned in the passage I have quoted: <q>A just man falls seven times and rises up again,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303201"><a href="../bible/pro024.htm#verse16">Proverbs&nbsp;24:16</a></span> and on the principle laid down that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall not hurt him in the day that he turns to repentance. <span class="stiki" id="note303202"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse12">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:12</a></span> In fact Zachariah the father of John who is described as a righteous man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in disbelieving the message sent to him and was at once punished with dumbness. <span class="stiki" id="note303203"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;1:20-22</a></span> Even Job, who at the outset of his history is spoken of as perfect and upright and uncomplaining, is afterwards <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be a sinner both by God's words and by his own confession.

<p>4. Roaming thus through the fairest fields of scripture I have culled its loveliest flowers to weave for your brows a garland of penitence; for my aim is that, flying on the wings of a dove, you may find rest  and make your peace with the Father of mercy. Your former wife, who is now your sister and fellow-servant, has told me that, acting on the apostolic precept, <span class="stiki" id="note303207"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:5</a></span> you and she lived apart by consent that you might give yourselves to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; but that after a time your feet sank beneath you as if resting on water and indeed&mdash; to speak plainly&mdash; gave way altogether. For her part she heard the Lord saying to her as to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: <q>as for you stand thou here by me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303208"><a href="../bible/deu005.htm#verse31">Deuteronomy&nbsp;5:31</a></span> and with the psalmist she said of Him: <q>He has set my feet upon a rock.</q>  But your house&mdash; she went on&mdash; having no sure foundation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> fell before a whirlwind of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note303210"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;7:24-27</a></span> Hers however still stands in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and does not refuse its shelter to you; you can still be joined in spirit to her to whom you were once joined in body. For, as the apostle says, <q>he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit</q> with him. <span class="stiki" id="note303211"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> Moreover, when the fury of the barbarians and the risk of captivity separated you again, you promised with a solemn <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that, if she made her way to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, you would follow her either immediately or later, and that you would try to save your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> now that by your carelessness you had seemed to lose it. Perform, now, the vow which you then made in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Human life is uncertain. Therefore, lest you may be snatched away before you have fulfilled your promise, imitate her whose teacher you ought to have been. For shame! The weaker vessel overcomes the world, and yet the stronger is overcome by it!</p>

<blockquote><p>A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> leads in the high prowess; </p></blockquote>

<p>and yet you will not follow her when her <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> leads you to the threshold of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>! Perhaps, however, you desire to save the remnants of your property and to see the last of your friends and fellow citizens and of their cities and villas. If so, amid the horrors of captivity, in the presence of exulting foes, and in the shipwreck of the province, at least hold fast to the plank of penitence;  and remember your fellow-servant  who daily sighs for your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and never despairs of it. While you are wandering about your own country (though, indeed, you no longer have a country; that which you once had, you have lost) she is interceding for you in the venerable spots which witnessed the nativity, crucifixion and resurrection of our Lord and Saviour, and in the first of which He uttered His infant-cry. She draws you to her by her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that you may be saved, if not by your own exertions, at any rate by her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Of old one lay upon his bed sick of the palsy, so powerless in all his joints that he could neither move his feet to walk nor his hands to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; yet when he was carried to our Lord by others, he was by Him so completely restored to health as to carry the bed which a little before had carried him. <span class="stiki" id="note303215"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;9:1-7</a></span> You too&mdash; absent in the body but present to her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; your fellow-servant offers to her Lord and Saviour; and with the Canaanite <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> she says of you: <q>my daughter is grievously vexed with a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303216"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;15:22</a></span> Souls are of no sex; therefore I may fairly call your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> the daughter of hers. For as a mother coaxes her unweaned child which is as yet unable to take solid food; so does she call you to the milk suitable for babes and offer to you the sustenance that a nursing mother gives. Thus shall you be able to say with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek your servant; for I do not forget your commandments.</q> </p>
