<h1>Letter 123</h1>

<p> <em>To the Same.</em></p>

<p>Your letter was a long one, and a pleasant one, and it shows how warm and genuine is your affection. So delighted am I with it that I am not at all sorry for having erroneously conjectured the meaning of the beginning of your former one. For my misapprehension of the intention of your letter has disclosed your brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, made plain the sincerity of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and shown your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. We have indeed shared between us the words and the trials of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has used the words; I am buffeted by the hurricane and billows, and against the rowers of the ship I exclaim in his words <q>They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</q>  Perhaps He who is Jonah's Lord and mine will grant that I too may rise and be released from the monster. But if the surge continue to boil I trust that even thus I shall enjoy the divine protection, and learn by my own experience how His strength is <q>made perfect in weakness,</q>  for He has measured the peril by my infirmity. The divine <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> whom I have mentioned was flung into the sea by his shipmates one and all, but I am granted the consolation of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and of other godly men. For them and for your godliness I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the blessing bestowed upon the excellent Onesiphorus may be yours, for you have not blushed at my gibes; nay rather you have shared in my afflictions for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith's</a> sake.</p>

<p>And one thing which I wish you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is that, though other godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have sent me their bounty, I have declined to receive it&mdash;not from any want of respect to the senders, God forbid&mdash;but because hitherto food convenient for me has been provided by Him Who gives it even to the ravens without stint. In the case of your reverence I have acted differently, for really the warmth of your affection has overcome what has hitherto been my fixed principle. For be well assured, my godly friend, that ever since friendship grew up between us the fire of our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has been kindled to greater heat.</p>
