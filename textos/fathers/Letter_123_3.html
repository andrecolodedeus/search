<h1>Letter 123</h1>

<p> <em>To Eudocia Augusta , about the Monks of Palestine. </em></p>

<h2>I. A request that she should use her influence with the monks of Palestine in reducing them to order.</h2>

<p>Leo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to Eudocia Augusta.</p>

<p>I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is aware how great is my devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, and with what care I am bound, God helping me, to guard against the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being withstood at any time by <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> or disloyal men. And, therefore, after expressing to you my dutiful greetings which your clemency is ever bound to receive at my hands, I entreat the Lord to gladden me with the news of your safety, and to bring aid evermore and more by your means to the maintenance of that article of the Faith over which the minds of certain <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> within the province of Palestine have been much disturbed; so that to the best of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> all confidence in such <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> perversity may be destroyed. For what but sheer destruction was to be feared by men who were not moved either by the principles of God's <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> , or by the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, or by the evidence of the sacred places themselves.  May it advantage then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, as by God's favour it does advantage them, and may it advantage the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> itself which the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> adopted at the Incarnation, that you have conceived the wish to take up your abode in that country  where the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of His wondrous acts and the signs of His sufferings speak to you of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> as not only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God but also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Man.</p>

<h2>II. They are to be told that the Catholic Faith rejects both the Eutychian and the Nestorian extremes. He wishes to be informed how far she succeeds.</h2>

<p>If then the aforesaid revere and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the name of <q><a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>,</q> and wish to be numbered among the members of the Lord's body, let them reject the crooked <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> which in their rashness they have committed, and let them show penitence  for their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of bloodshed.  For the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> let them yield to the synodal decrees which have been confirmed in the city of Chalcedon. And because nothing but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and quiet humility attains to the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, let them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what they read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, what they confess in the Creed, and not mix themselves up with unsound doctrines. For as the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith condemns <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, who dared to maintain two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in our one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, so does it also condemn Eutyches and Dioscorus  who deny that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh was assumed in the Virgin Mother's womb by the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>.</p>

<p>If your exhortations have any success in convincing these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, which will win for you <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, I beseech your clemency to inform me of it by letter; that I may have the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that you have reaped the fruit of your good work, and that they through the Lord's mercy have not perished. Dated the 15th of June, in the consulship of the illustrious Opilio (453).</p>
