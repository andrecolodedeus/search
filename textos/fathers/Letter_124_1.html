<h1>Letter 124</h1>

<p><strong>To Avitus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Avitus to whom this letter is addressed is probably the same person who induced Jerome to write to Salvina (see Letter LXXIX., &sect;I, ante). The occasion of writing is as follows. Ten years previously (that is to say in A.D. 399 or 400) Pammachius had asked Jerome to supply him with a correct version of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <em>First Principles</em> to enable him to detect the variations introduced by Rufinus into his rendering. This Jerome willingly did (see Letters LXXXIII. and LXXXIV.) but when the work in its integrity was perused by Pammachius he thought it so erroneous in doctrine that he determined not to circulate it. However, <q>a certain brother</q> induced him to lend the manuscript to him for a short time; and then, when he had got it into his hands, had a hasty and incorrect transcript made, which he immediately published much to the chagrin of Pammachius. Falling into the hands of Avitus a copy of this much perplexed him and he seems to have appealed to Jerome for an explanation. This the latter now gives forwarding at the same time an authentic edition of his version of the <em>First Principles</em>. The date of the letter is A.D. 409 or 410.</span> </p>

<p>1. About ten years ago that saintly man Pammachius sent me a copy of a certain person's rendering,  or rather misrendering, of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <em>First Principles;</em> with a request that in a Latin version I should give the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of the Greek and should set down the writer's words for good or for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> without bias in either direction.  When I did as he wished and sent him the book,  he was shocked to read it and locked it up in his desk lest being circulated it might wound the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of many. However, a certain brother, who had <q>a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for God but not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,</q>  asked for a loan of the manuscript that he might read it; and, as he promised to return it without delay, Pammachius, thinking no harm could happen in so short a time, unsuspectingly consented. Hereupon he who had borrowed the book to read, with the aid of <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> copied the whole of it and gave it back much sooner than he had promised. Then with the same rashness or&mdash; to use a less severe term&mdash; thoughtlessness he made bad worse by confiding to others what he had thus stolen. Moreover, since a bulky treatise on an abstruse subject is difficult to reproduce with accuracy, especially if it has to be taken down surreptitiously and in a hurry, order and sense were <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in several passages. Whence it comes, my dear Avitus, that you ask me to send you a copy of my version as made for Pammachius and not for the public, a garbled edition of which has been published by the aforesaid brother.</p>

<p>2. Take then what you have asked for; but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there are countless things in the book to be abhorred, and that, as the Lord says, you will have to walk among scorpions and serpents.  It begins by saying that Christ was made God's son not born;  that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, as He is by nature invisible, is invisible even to the Son;  that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, who is the likeness of the invisible Father, compared with the Father is not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> but compared with us who cannot receive the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the almighty Father seems a figure of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so that we perceive the majesty and magnitude of the greater in the less, the Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> limited in the Son;  that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father is a light incomprehensible and that Christ compared with him is but a minute brightness, although by reason of our incapacity to us he appears a great one.  The Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> are compared to two <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, a larger one and a small; the first filling the world and being somehow invisible through its size, the second cognisable by the eyes of men.  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> the writer terms good and of perfect goodness; but of the Son he says: <q>He is not good but an emanation and likeness of goodness; not good absolutely but only with a qualification, as 'the good shepherd' and the like.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> he places after the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> as third in dignity and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. And while he declares  that he does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is created or uncreated,  he has later on given his own opinion that except <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father alone there is nothing uncreated. <q>The Son,</q> he states, <q>is inferior to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, inasmuch as He is second and the Father first; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> which dwells in all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is inferior to the Son. In the same way the power of the Father is greater than that of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Likewise the power of the Son is greater than that of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and as a consequence the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in its turn has greater <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> than other things called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>.</q> </p>

<p>3. Then, when he comes to deal with rational creatures and to describe their lapse into earthly bodies as due to their own negligence, he goes on to say: <q>Surely it argues great negligence and sloth for a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so far to empty itself as to fall into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and allow itself to be tied to the material body of an unreasoning brute;</q> and in a subsequent passage: <q>These reasonings induce me to suppose that it is by their own free act that some are numbered with God's <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and servants, and that it was through their own fault that others fell from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> into such negligence that they were changed into forces of an opposite kind.</q>  He maintains that after every end a fresh beginning springs forth and an end from each beginning, and that wholesale variation is possible; so that one who is now a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being may in another world become a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, while one who by reason of his negligence is now a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> may hereafter be placed in a more material body and thus become a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being.  So far does he carry this transforming process that on his theory an archangel may become the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in turn be changed back into an archangel. <q>Such as have wavered or faltered but have not altogether fallen shall be made subject, for rule and government and guidance, to better things&mdash; to principalities and powers, to thrones and dominations</q>; and of these perhaps another <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> will be formed, when in the words of Isaiah there shall be <q>new heavens and a new earth.' <span class="stiki" id="note303369"><a href="../bible/isa065.htm#verse17">Isaiah&nbsp;65:17</a></span> But such as have not deserved to return through humanity to their former estate shall become the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> of the worst sort; and according to what they have done shall have special duties assigned to them in particular worlds.</q> Moreover, the very <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and rulers of darkness in any world or worlds, if they are willing to turn to better things, may become <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings and so come back to their first beginning. That is to say, after they have borne the discipline of punishment and torture for a longer or a shorter time in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies, they may again reach the angelic pinnacles from which they have fallen. Hence it may be shown that we men may change into any other reasonable beings, and that not once only or on emergency but time after time; we and <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> shall become <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> if we neglect our duty; and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, if they will take to themselves <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, may attain to the rank of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</p>

<p>4. Bodily substances too are to pass away utterly or else at the end of all things will become highly rarified like the sky and &aelig;ther and other subtle bodies. It is clear that these principles must affect the writer's view of the resurrection. The sun also and the moon and the rest of the constellations are alive. Nay more; as we men by reason of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are enveloped in bodies material and sluggish; so the lights of heaven have for like reasons received bodies more or less luminous, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have been for more serious faults clothed with starry frames. This, he argues, is the view of the apostle who writes:&mdash; <q>the creation has been subjected to vanity and shall be delivered for the revealing of the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  That it may not be supposed that I am imputing to him ideas of my own I shall give his actual words. <q>At the end and consummation of the world,</q> he writes, <q>when <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and beings endowed with reason shall be released from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> by the Lord, they will move slowly or fly quickly according as they have previously been <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> or energetic. And as all of them have <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> and are free to choose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, those who choose the latter will be much worse off than they now are. But those who choose the former will improve their condition. Their movements and decisions in this direction or in that will determine their various futures; whether, that is, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are to become men or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and whether <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are to become men or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> Then after adducing various arguments in support of his thesis and maintaining that while not incapable of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has yet not chosen to be <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, he has finally reasoned with much diffuseness that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>&mdash; all according to him of one nature but of different wills&mdash; may in punishment for great negligence or folly be transformed into brutes. Moreover, to avoid the agony of punishment and the burning flame the more sensitive may choose to become low organisms, to dwell in water, to assume the shape of this or that animal; so that we have reason to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> a metamorphosis not only into four-footed things but even into fishes. Then, lest he should be held guilty of maintaining with Pythagoras the transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, he winds up the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> reasoning with which he has wounded his reader by saying: <q>I must not be taken to make <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of these things; they are only thrown out as conjectures to show that they are not altogether overlooked.</q></p>

<p>5. In his second book he maintains a plurality of worlds; not, however, as <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> taught, many like ones existing at once, but a new one beginning each time that the old comes to an end. There was a world before this world of ours, and after it there will be first one and then another and so on in regular succession. He is in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whether one world shall be so completely similar to another as to leave no room for any difference between them, or whether one world shall never wholly be indistinguishable from another. And again a little farther on he writes: <q>if, as the course of the discussion makes necessary, all things can live without body, all bodily <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> shall be swallowed up and that which once has been made out of nothing shall again be reduced to nothing. And yet a time will come when its use will be once more necessary.</q> And in the same context: <q>but if, as reason and the authority of scripture show, this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, death shall be swallowed up in victory and corruption in incorruption. <span class="stiki" id="note303371"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53-54</a></span> And it may be that all bodily <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> shall be removed, for it is only in this that death can operate.</q> And a little farther on: <q>if these things are not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it may be that we shall some day live in a disembodied state. Moreover, if only he is fully subject to Christ who is disembodied, and if all must be made subject to Him, we too shall lose our bodies when we become fully subject to Him.</q> And in the same passage: <q>if all are to be made subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all shall lay aside their bodies; and then all bodily <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> shall be brought to nought. But if through the fall of reasonable beings it is a second time required it will reappear. For God has left <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to strive and struggle, to teach them that full and complete victory is to be attained not by their own efforts but by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And so to my mind worlds vary with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them, and those are exploded theories which maintain that all worlds are alike.</q> And again: <q>three conjectures occur to me with regard to the end; it is for the reader to determine which is nearest to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For either we shall be bodiless when being made subject to Christ we shall be made subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and He shall be all in all; or as things made subject to Christ shall be with Christ Himself made subject to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and brought under one law, so all substance shall be refined into its most perfect form and rarified into &aelig;ther which is a pure and uncompounded <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>; or else the sphere which I have called motionless and all that it contains will be dissolved into nothing, and the sphere in which the antizone  itself is contained shall be called 'good ground,' <span class="stiki" id="note303373"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;13:8</a></span> and that other sphere which in its revolution surrounds the earth and goes by the name of heaven shall be reserved for the abode of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q></p>

<p>6. In speaking thus does he not most clearly follow the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and foist upon the simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> the ravings of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? In the same book he writes: <q>it remains that God is invisible. But if He is by nature invisible, He must be so even to the Saviour.</q> And lower down: <q>no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which has descended into a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body has borne upon it so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> an impress of its previous character as Christ's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of which He says: 'no man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself.'</q>  And in another place: <q>we must carefully consider whether <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, when they have won <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and have attained to the blessed life, may not cease to be <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For as the Lord and Saviour came to seek and to save that which was lost <span class="stiki" id="note303375"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span> that it might cease to be lost; so the lost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which the Lord came to save, when saved, will cease to be a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. We must ask ourselves whether, as the lost was not lost once and again will not be, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> likewise may have been and again may be not a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  And after a good many remarks upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> he brings in the following, <q><span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03C2;</span> or</q> intelligence by falling becomes a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and by acquiring <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> this will become intelligence again. This at least is a fair inference from the case of <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> who for his old <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is condemned to lead a lower life. And concerning the heavenly bodies we must make a similar acknowledgment. The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the sun&mdash; or whatever else you like to call it&mdash; does not date its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the creation of the world; it already <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> before it entered its shining and glowing body. So also with the moon and stars. From antecedent causes they have been made subject to vanity not willingly but for future reward, <span class="stiki" id="note303377"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;8:20</a></span> and are forced to do not their own will but the creator's who has assigned to them their several spheres.</p>

<p>7. Hellfire, moreover, and the torments with which <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scripture threatens sinners he explains not as external punishments but as the pangs of guilty <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> when by God's power the memory of our transgressions is set before our eyes. <q>The whole crop of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> grows up afresh from seeds which remain in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and all our dishonourable and undutiful acts are again pictured before our gaze. Thus it is the fire of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and the stings of remorse which torture the mind as it looks back on former self-indulgence.</q> And again: <q>but perhaps this coarse and earthly body ought to be described as mist and darkness; for at the end of this world and when it becomes necessary to pass into another, the like darkness will lead to the like physical birth.</q> In speaking thus he clearly pleads for the transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as taught by Pythagoras and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>.  And at the end of the second book in dealing with our perfection he has said: when we shall have made such progress as not only to cease to be flesh or body but perhaps also to cease to be <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> our perfect intelligence and perception, undimmed with any mist of passion, will discern reasonable and intelligible substances face to face.</p>

<p>8. In the third book the following faulty statements are contained. <q>If we once admit that, when one vessel is made to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and another to dishonour, <span class="stiki" id="note303379"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:20</a></span> this is due to antecedent causes; why may we not revert to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and allow that it is loved in one and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> in another because of its past actions, before in Jacob it becomes a supplanter and before in <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> it is supplanted?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303380"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse2">Malachi&nbsp;1:2-3</a></span> And again: <q>the fact that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are made some to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and some to dishonour is to be explained by their previous history.</q> And in the same place: <q>on this hypothesis of mine a vessel made to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which fails to fulfil its object will in another world become a vessel made to dishonour; and contrariwise a vessel which has from a previous fault been condemned to dishonour will, if it accepts correction in this present life, become in the new creation a vessel 'sanctified and meet for the Master's use and prepared unto every good work.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303381"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:21</a></span> And he immediately goes on to say: <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that men who begin with small faults may become so hardened in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> that, if they do not repent and turn to better things, they must become inhuman energies;  and contrariwise that hostile and demonic beings may in course of time so far heal their wounds and check the current of their former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that they may attain to the abode of the perfect. As I have often said, in those countless and unceasing worlds in which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lives and has its being some grow worse and worse until they reach the lowest depths of degradation; while others in those lowest depths grow better and better until they reach the perfection of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</q> Thus he tries to show that men, or rather their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, may become <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; and that <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in turn may be restored to the rank of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. In the same book he writes: <q>this too must be considered; why the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is diversely acted upon now by influences of one kind and now by influences of another.</q> And he surmises that this is due to conduct which has preceded birth. It is for this, he argues, that John leaps in his mother's womb when at Mary's salutation <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a> declares herself unworthy of her notice. <span class="stiki" id="note303383"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;1:41</a></span> And he immediately subjoins: <q>on the other hand infants that are hardly weaned are possessed with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> and become <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> and soothsayers;  indeed, some are indwelt from their earliest years with the spirit of a python. Now as they have done nothing to bring upon themselves these visitations, one who holds that nothing happens without God's permission, and that all things are governed by His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, cannot suppose that God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> has abandoned them without good reason.</q></p>

<p>9. Again, of the world he writes thus: <q>The belief commends itself to me that there was a world before this world and that after it there will be another. Do you wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that after the decay of this world there will be a new one? Hear the words of Isaiah: 'the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me.' <span class="stiki" id="note303385"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse22">Isaiah&nbsp;66:22</a></span> Do you wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that before the making of this world there have previously been others? Listen to the Preacher who says: 'the thing which has been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Is there anything whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It has been already of old time, which was before us.' <span class="stiki" id="note303386"><a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse9">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;1:9-10</a></span> A passage which proves not only that other worlds have been but that other worlds shall be; not, however, simultaneously and side by side but one after another.</q> And he immediately adds: <q>I hold that heaven is the abode of the deity, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> place of rest; and that it was there that reasonable creatures enjoyed their ancient bliss, before coming down to a lower plane and exchanging the invisible for the visible, they fell to the earth and came to need material bodies. Now that they have fallen, God the creator has made for them bodies suitable to their surroundings; and has fashioned this visible world, and has sent into it ministers to ensure the salvation   and correction of the fallen. Of these ministers some have held assigned positions and have been subject to the world's necessary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>; while others have intelligently performed duties laid upon them in times and seasons determined by God's plan. To the former class belong the sun, moon, and stars called by the apostle 'the creation.' and these have had allotted to them the heights of heaven. Now the creation is subjected to vanity  because it is encased in material bodies and visible to the eye. And yet it is 'made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope.' Others again of the second class, at particular places and times <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to their Maker only, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> sent to steer the world.</q> A little farther on he says: <q>the affairs of the world are so ordered by Providence that while some <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> fall from heaven others freely glide down to earth. The former are hurled down against their will; the latter descend from choice alone. The former are forced to continue in a distasteful service for a fixed period; the latter spontaneously embrace the task of lending a hand to those who fall.</q> Again he writes: <q>whence it follows that these different movements result in the creation of different worlds; and that this world of ours will be succeeded by one quite unlike it. Now, as regards this falling and rising, this rewarding of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and punishment of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, whether they take place in the past, present, or future, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the creator, can alone apportion desert and make all things converge to one end. For He only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> why He allows some to follow their own inclination and to descend from the higher planes to the lowest; and why He visits others and giving them His hand draws them back to their former state and places them once more in heaven.</q></p>

<p>10. In discussing the end of the world he has made use of the following language. <q>Since, as I have often said, a new beginning springs from the end, it may be asked whether bodies will then continue to exist, or whether, when they have been annihilated, we shall live without bodies and be incorporeal as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God to be. Now there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that, if bodies or, as the apostle calls them, visible things, belong only to our sensible world, the life of the disembodied will be incorporeal.</q> And a little farther on: <q>when the apostle writes, 'the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,'  I explain his words thus. Reasonable and incorporeal beings are the highest of God's creatures, for not being clothed with bodies they are not the slaves of corruption. Since where there are bodies, there corruption is sure to be found. But hereafter 'the creation shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption,' and then men shall receive the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and God shall be all in all.</q> And in the same passage he writes: <q>that the final state will be an incorporeal one is rendered credible by the words of our Saviour's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>: 'as thou, Father, art in me and I in you, that they also may be one in us.' <span class="stiki" id="note303389"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;17:21</a></span> For we ought to realize what God is and what the Saviour will finally be, and how the likeness to the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> here promised to the Saints consists in this that as They are one in Themselves so we shall be one in Them. For if in the end the life of the Saints is to be assimilated to the life of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we must either admit that the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> is clothed with a body and that he is enveloped in matter as we are in flesh; or, if it is unbecoming to suppose this, especially in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have but small clues from which to infer God's majesty and to guess at the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His innate and transcendent nature, we are reduced to the following dilemma. Either we shall always have bodies and in that case must despair of ever being like <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or, if the blessedness of the life of God is really promised to us, the conditions of His life must be the conditions of ours.</q></p>

<p>11. These passages prove what his view is regarding the resurrection. For he evidently maintains that all bodies will perish and that we shall be incorporeal as according to him we were before we received our present bodies. Again when he comes to argue for a variety of worlds and to maintain that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> will become <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> either <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or men, and men in their turn <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>; in a word that everything will be turned into something else, he thus sums up his own opinion: <q>no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, after an interval matter will exist afresh and bodies will be formed and a different world will be created to meet the varying wills of reasonable beings who, having forfeited the perfect bliss which continues to the end, have gradually fallen into so great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> as to change their nature and refuse to keep their first estate of unalloyed blessedness. Many reasonable beings, it is right to say, keep it until a second, a third, and a fourth world, and give God no ground for changing their condition. Others deteriorate so little that they seem to have lost hardly anything, and others again have to be hurled headlong into the abyss. God who orders all things alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to use each class according to its deserts in a suitable sphere; for He only understands opportunities and motives and the course in which the world must be steered. Thus one who has borne away the palm for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and has sunk into the lowest degradation will in the world which is hereafter to be fashioned be made a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, a kind of first fruits of the Lord's handiwork, to be a laughing stock to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> who have lost their first <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</q> What is this but to argue that the sinful men of this world may become a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> in another; and contrariwise that those who are now <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> may hereafter become either men or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>? And after a lengthy discussion in which he maintains that all corporeal creatures must exchange their material for subtle and spiritual bodies and that all substance must become one pure and inconceivably bright body, of which the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind can at present form no conception, he winds up thus:&mdash; <q>'God shall be all in all;' that is to say, all bodily <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> shall be made as perfect as possible; it shall be brought into the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, than which there is none better.</q></p>

<p>12. In the fourth and last book of his work the following passages deserve the church's condemnation. <q>It may be that as, when men die in this world by the separation of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, they are allotted different positions in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> according to the difference in their works; so when <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> die, out of the system of the heavenly Jerusalem, they come down to this world as a <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and are placed on earth according to their deserts.</q> And again: <q>as we have compared the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which pass from this world to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> with those which as they come from heaven to us are in a manner dead; so we must carefully inquire whether this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> without exception. For in that case <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> born on earth when they desire better things rise out of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> and assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies or when they desire worse things come down to us from better worlds; and in the firmament above us likewise there are <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> on their way from our world to higher ones, and others who, while they have fallen from heaven, have not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> so grievously as to be thrust down to earth.</q> He thus tries to prove that the firmament, that is the sky, is <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> compared with heaven; and that this earth is <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> compared with the firmament; and again that our world is heaven to <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Or in other words what is <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> to some is heaven to others. And not content with saying this he goes on: <q>at the end of all things when we shall return to the heavenly Jerusalem the hostile powers shall declare <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>  against the people of God to breathe and exercise their valour and strengthen their resolve. For this they cannot have until they have faced and foiled their foes; of whom we read in the book of Numbers  that they are overcome by reason, discipline, and tactical skill.</q></p>

<p>13. After saying that according to the apocalypse of John <q>the everlasting gospel</q> which shall be revealed in heaven <span class="stiki" id="note303392"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;14:6</a></span> as much surpasses our gospel as Christ's preaching does the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>  of the ancient law, he has asserted what it is <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> even to think; that Christ will once more suffer in the sky for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. And although he has not expressly said it, it is yet implied in his words that as for men God became man to set men free, so for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> when He comes to deliver them He will become a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>. To show that this is no gloss of mine, I must give his own words: <q>As Christ,</q> he writes, <q>has fulfilled the shadow of the law by the shadow of the gospel, and as all law is a pattern and shadow of things done in heaven, we must inquire whether we are justified in supposing that even the heavenly law and the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the celestial worship are still incomplete and need the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> gospel which in the apocalypse of John is called everlasting to distinguish it from ours which is only temporal, set forth in a world that shall pass away. Now if we extend our inquiry to the passion of our Lord and Saviour, it may indeed be overbold to suppose that He will suffer in heaven; yet if there is spiritual <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in heavenly places <span class="stiki" id="note303394"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> and if we confess without a blush that the Lord has once been crucified to destroy those things which He has destroyed by His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>; why need we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a like occurrence in the upper world in the fullness of time, so that the nations of all realms shall be saved by a passion of Christ?</q></p>

<p>14. Here is another <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> which he has spoken of the Son. <q>Assuming that the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, it would seem that by this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> He can comprehend Him as much as a craftsman can comprehend the rules of his art. And, doubtless, if the Father is in the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, He is also comprehended by Him in whom He is. But if we mean by comprehension not merely that the knower takes a thing in by perception and insight but that he contains it within himself by virtue of a special faculty; in this sense we cannot say that the Son comprehends the Father. For the Father comprehends all things, and of these the Son is one; therefore, He comprehends the Son.</q> And to show us reasons why, while the Father comprehends the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, the Son cannot comprehend the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, he adds: <q>the curious reader may inquire whether the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Himself in the same way that the Son <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Him. But if he recalls the words: 'the Father who sent me is greater than I,' <span class="stiki" id="note303395"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> he will allow that they must be universally <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and will admit that, in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> as in everything else, the Father is greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> Himself more perfectly and immediately than the Son can do.</q></p>

<p>15. The following passage is a convincing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that he holds the transmigration of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and annihilation of bodies. <q>If it can be shown that an incorporeal and reasonable being has life in itself independently of the body and that it is worse off in the body than out of it; then beyond a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> bodies are only of secondary importance and arise from time to time to meet the varying conditions of reasonable creatures. Those who require bodies are clothed with them, and contrariwise, when fallen <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have lifted themselves up to better things, their bodies are once more annihilated. They are thus ever vanishing and ever reappearing.</q> And to prevent us from minimizing the impiety of his previous utterances he ends his work by maintaining that all reasonable beings, that is, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, powers, dominations, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and even man by right of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> dignity, are of one and the same <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> he writes, <q>and His only-begotten Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> are conscious of an intellectual and reasonable nature. But so also are the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the powers, and the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as well as the inward man who is created in the image and after the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  From which I conclude that God and they are in some sort of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>.</q> He adds <q>in some sort</q> to escape the charge of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>; and while in another place he will not allow the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be of one substance with the Father lest by so doing he should appear to make the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> divisible, he here bestows the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God almighty upon <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and men.</p>

<p>16. This being the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> book, is it anything short of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to change a few <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> passages regarding the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and then to publish the rest unchanged with an unprincipled eulogy when the parts unaltered as well as the parts altered flow from the same fountain head of gross impiety? This is not the time to confute all the statements made in detail; and indeed those who have written against <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Eunomius, Manich&aelig;us, and various other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> must be supposed to have answered these <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> as well. If anyone, therefore, wishes to read the work let him walk with his feet shod towards the land of promise; let him guard against the jaws of the serpent and the crooked jaws of the scorpion; let him read this treatise first and before he enters upon the path let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the dangers which he will have to avoid.</p>
