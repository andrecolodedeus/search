<h1>Letter 124</h1>

<p> <em>To the Monks of Palestine.</em></p>

<h2>I. They have possibly been misled by a wrong translation of his letter on the Incarnation to Flavian.</h2>

<p>Leo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to the whole body of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> settled throughout Palestine.</p>

<p>The anxious care, which I owe to the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to all its sons, has ascertained from many sources that some offense has been given to your minds, beloved, through my interpreters , who being either <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, as it appears, or malicious, have made you take some of my statements in a different sense to what I meant, not being capable of turning the Latin into Greek with proper accuracy, although in the explanation of subtle and difficult matters, one who undertakes to discuss them can scarcely satisfy himself even in his own tongue. And yet this has so far been of advantage to me, that by your disapproving of what the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith rejects, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you are greater friends to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> than to the false: and that you quite properly refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what I myself also abhor, in accordance with ancient doctrine.  For although my letter addressed to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Flavian, of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, is of itself sufficiently explicit, and stands in no need either of correction or explanation, yet other of my writings harmonize with that letter, and in them my position will be found similarly set forth. For necessity was laid upon me to argue against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who have thrown many of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> peoples into confusion, both before our most merciful princes and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synodal Council, and the church of Constantinople, and thus I have laid down what we ought to think and feel on the Incarnation of the Word according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and Apostles, and in nothing have I departed from the creed of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers: because the Faith is one, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, unique, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and to it nothing can be added, nothing taken away: though <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> first, and now Eutyches, have endeavoured to assail it from an opposite standpoint, but with similar disloyalty, and have tried to impose on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> two contradictory <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, which has led to their both being deservedly condemned by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Truth; because the false view which they both held in different ways was exceedingly mad and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>.</p>

<h2>II. Eutyches, who confounds the persons, is as much to be rejected as Nestorius, who separates them. </h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, therefore, must be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> for believing the Blessed Virgin Mary to be mother of His manhood only, whereby he made the person of His flesh one thing, and that of His Godhead another, and did not recognize the one Christ in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> and in the flesh, but spoke of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> as separate and distinct from the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>: although, without losing that unchangeable <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> which belongs to Him together with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> from all <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> and without respect of time, the <q>Word became flesh</q> within the Virgin's womb in such wise that by that one conception and one parturition she was at the same time, in virtue of the union of the two substances, both handmaid and mother of the Lord. This <a href="../cathen/05387b.htm">Elizabeth</a> also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, as Luke the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> declares, when she said: <q>Whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me <span class="stiki" id="note360518"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;1:43</a></span>?</q> But Eutyches also must be stricken with the same <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>, who, becoming entangled in the treacherous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the old <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, has chosen the third dogma of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> : so that he denies the reality of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and maintains the whole of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> to be of one nature, as if the Godhead of the Word had turned itself into flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: and as if to be conceived and born, to be nursed and grow, to be crucified and die, to be buried and rise again, and to ascend into heaven and to sit on the Father's right hand, from whence He shall come to judge the living and the dead&mdash; as if all those things belonged to that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> only which admits of none of them without the reality of the flesh: seeing that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Only-begotten is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and that the undivided unity and consubstantial equality of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Trinity is at once impassible and unchangeable. But if  this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> withdraws from the perverse views of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, lest he be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to hold that the Godhead is passible  and mortal: and yet dares to pronounce the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Incarnate Word that is of the Word made Flesh one, he undoubtedly crosses over into the mad view of Manich&aelig;us  and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> , and believes that the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the mediator between God and men, did all things in an unreal way, and had not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, but that a phantom-like apparition presented itself to the beholders' eyes.</p>

<h2>III. The acknowledgment of our nature in Christ is necessary to orthodoxy.</h2>

<p>As these iniquitous lies were once rejected by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, and such men's <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> condemned by the unanimous votes of the blessed Fathers throughout the world, whoever these are that are so blinded and strange to the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as to deny the presence of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, that is our, nature in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> from the time of the Incarnation, they must show on what ground they claim the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and in what way they harmonize with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, if the child-bearing of the blessed Virgin produced either the flesh without the Godhead or the Godhead without the flesh. For as it cannot be denied that <q>the Word became flesh and dwelt in us <span class="stiki" id="note360524"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span>,</q> so it cannot be denied that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, reconciling the world to Himself <span class="stiki" id="note360525"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:19</a></span> .</q> But what reconciliation can there be, whereby God might be propitiated for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, unless the mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> took up the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all? And in what way could He properly fulfil His mediation, unless He who in the form of God was equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, were a sharer of our nature also in the form of a slave: so that the one new Man might effect a renewal of the old: and the bond of death fastened on us by one man's wrong-doing  might be loosened by the death of the one Man who alone owed nothing to death. For the pouring out of the blood of the righteous on behalf of the unrighteous was so powerful in its effect , so rich a ransom that, if the whole body of us prisoners only <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in their Redeemer, not one would be held in the tyrant's bonds: since as the Apostle says, <q>where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> also did much more abound <span class="stiki" id="note360528"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> .</q> And since we, who were born under the imputation  of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, have received the power of a new birth unto righteousness, the gift of liberty has become stronger than the debt of slavery.</p>

<h2>IV. They only benefit by the blood of Christ who truly share in His death and resurrection.</h2>

<p>What hope then do they, who deny the reality of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> person in our Saviour's body, leave for themselves in the efficacy of this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>? Let them say by what <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> they have been reconciled, by what blood-shedding brought back. Who is He <q>who gave Himself for us an offering and a victim to God for a sweet smell <span class="stiki" id="note360530"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;5:2</a></span>:</q> or what <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was ever more hallowed than that which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> High <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> placed upon the altar of the cross by the immolation of His own flesh? For although in the sight of the Lord the death of many of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> has been precious , yet no innocent's death was the propitiation of the world. The righteous have received, not given, crowns: and from the endurance of the faithful have arisen examples of patience, not the gift of justification. For their deaths affected themselves alone, and no one has paid off another's debt by his own death : one alone among the sons of men, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, stands out as One in whom all are crucified, all dead, all buried, all raised again. Of them He Himself said <q>when I am lifted from the earth, I will draw all (things) unto Me. </q> True <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also, that justifies the transgressors and makes them just, is drawn to Him who shared their <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> natures and wins <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in Him, in whom alone man finds himself not guilty; and thus is free to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the power of Him who in the humiliation of our flesh engaged in conflict with the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> foe, and shared His victory with those in whose body He had triumphed.</p>

<h2>V. The actions of Christ's two natures must be kept distinct.</h2>

<p>Although therefore in our one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and man, the person of the Word and of the flesh is one, and both beings have their actions in common : yet we must understand the character of the acts themselves, and by the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of sincere <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> distinguish those to which the humility of His weakness is brought from those to which His sublime power is inclined: what it is that the flesh without the Word or the Word without the flesh does not do. For instance, without the power of the Word the Virgin would not have conceived nor brought forth: and without the reality of the flesh His infancy would not have laid wrapt in swaddling clothes. Without the power of the Word the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> would not have adored the Child that a new star had pointed out to them: and without the reality of the flesh that Child would not have been ordered to be carried away into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod's</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Without the power of the Word the Father's voice uttered from the sky would not have said, <q>This is My beloved <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, in whom I am well pleased :</q> and without the reality of the flesh John would not have been able to point to Him and say: <q>Behold the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, behold Him that bears away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the world. </q> Without the power of the Word there would have been no restoring of the sick to health, no raising of the dead to life: and without the reality of the flesh He would not have hungered and needed food, nor grown weary and needed rest. Lastly, without the power of the Word, the Lord would not have professed Himself equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and without the reality of the flesh He would not also have said that the Father was greater than He: for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith upholds and defends both positions, believing the only <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be both Man and the Word according to the distinctive properties of His divine and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> substance.</p>

<h2>VI. There is no confusion of the two natures in Christ. </h2>

<p>Although therefore from that beginning whereby in the Virgin's womb <q>the Word became flesh,</q> no sort of division ever arose between the Divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> substance, and through all the growth and changes of His body, the actions were of one Person the whole time, yet we do not by any mixing of them up confound those very acts which were done inseparably: and from the character of the acts we perceive what belonged to either form. For neither do His Divine acts affect  His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, nor His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> acts His Divine, since both concur in this way and to this very end that in their operation His twofold qualities be not absorbed the one by the other, nor His individuality doubled. Therefore let those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> phantom-mongers  tell us, what nature of the Saviour's it was that was fastened to the wood of the Cross, that lay in the tomb, and that on the third day rose in the flesh when the stone was rolled away from the grave: or what kind of body Jesus presented to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> eyes entering when the doors were shut upon them: seeing that to drive away the beholders' disbelief, He required them to inspect with their eyes and to handle with their hands the still open prints of the nails and the flesh wound of His pierced side. But if in spite of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> being so clear, their persistence in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> will not abandon their position in the darkness, let them show whence they promise themselves the hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, which no one can attain to, save through the mediator between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the man <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For <q>there is not another name given to men under heaven, in which they must be saved <span class="stiki" id="note360540"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse12">Acts&nbsp;4:12</a></span> .</q> Neither is there any ransoming of men from captivity, save in His blood, <q>who gave Himself a ransom for all <span class="stiki" id="note360541"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:6</a></span>:</q> who, as the blessed apostle proclaims, <q>when He was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> that He was equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but emptied Himself, receiving the form of a slave, being made in the likeness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and being found in fashion as a man He humbled Himself, being made <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> even unto death, the death of the cross. For which reason God also exalted Him, and gave Him a name which is above every name: that in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> every knee may bow of things in heaven, of things on the earth, and of things under the earth, and that every tongue may confess that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father <span class="stiki" id="note360542"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6-11</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>VII. It was as being <q>in form of a slave,</q> not as Son of God that he was exalted.</h2>

<p> Although therefore the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is one, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Manhood in Him forms absolutely one and the same person, and the entirety of this union cannot be separated by any division, yet the exaltation wherewith <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> exalted Him,</q> and <q>gave Him a name which excels every name,</q> we understand to belong to that form which needed to be enriched by this increase of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.  Of course <q>in the form of God</q> the Son was equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and between the Father and the Only-begotten there was no distinction in point of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, no diversity in point of majesty: nor through the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>  of the Incarnation had the Word been deprived of anything which should be restored Him by the Father's gift. But <q>the form of a slave</q> by which the impassible Godhead fulfilled a pledge of mighty loving-kindness , is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness which was lifted up into the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the divine power, the Godhead and the manhood being right from the Virgin's conception so completely united that without the manhood the divine acts, and without the Godhead the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> acts were not performed. For which reason as the Lord of majesty is said to have been crucified, so He who from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> is equal with God is said to have been exalted. Nor does it matter by which substance Christ is spoken of, since the unity of His person inseparably remaining He is at once both wholly <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> according to the flesh and wholly <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> according to His Godhead, which is one with the Father. Whatever therefore Christ received in time, He received in virtue of His manhood, on which are conferred whatsoever it had not. For according to the power of the Word, <q>all things that the Father has</q> the Son also has indiscriminately, and what <q>in the form of a slave</q> He received from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He also Himself gave in the form of the Father. He is in Himself at once both rich and poor; rich, because <q>in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and God was the Word. This was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All things were made through Him, and without Him was made nothing:</q> and poor because <q>the Word became flesh and dwelt in us. </q> But what is that emptying of Himself, or that poverty except the receiving of the form of a slave by which the majesty of the Word was veiled, and the scheme for man's redemption carried out? For as the original chains of our captivity could not be loosed, unless a man of our race and of our nature appeared who was not under the prejudice of the old debt, and who with his untainted blood might blot out the bond of death , as it had from the beginning been divinely fore-ordained, so it came to pass in the fullness of the appointed time that the promise which had been proclaimed in many ways might reach its long expected fulfilment, and that thus, what had been frequently announced by one testimony after another, might have all doubtfulness removed.</p>

<h2>VIII. A protest against their faithlessness and inconsistency in this matter.</h2>

<p>And so, as all these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have been destroyed, which through the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> devotion of the presiding Fathers have been cut off from the body of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, and which deserved to be exiles from Christ, because they have made the Incarnation of the Word, which is the one <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> aright, a stone of offense and a stumbling-block to themselves, I am surprised that you, beloved, have any difficulty in discerning the light of the Truth. And since it has been made clear by numerous explanations that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Faith was right in condemning both <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> and Eutyches with Dioscorus, and that a man cannot be called a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who gives his assent to the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> opinion of either the one or the other, I am grieved that you are, as I hear, doing despite to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and the Apostles by stirring up the various bodies of citizens with seditions, by disturbing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and by inflicting not only insults, but even death, upon <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, so that you lose sight of your resolves and profession  through your fury and cruelty. Where is your rule of meekness and quietness? Where is the long-suffering of patience? Where the tranquillity of peace? Where the firm foundation of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of endurance? What <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> persuasion has carried you off, what <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> has separated you from the gospel of Christ? Or what strange craftiness of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Deceiver</a> has shown itself that, forgetting the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, forgetting the health-giving creed and confession which you pronounced before many witnesses when you received the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> you should give yourselves up to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Devil's</a> deceits? What effect would <q>the Claws </q> and other cruel tortures have had on you if the empty comments of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have had so much weight in taking the purity of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by storm? You think you are acting for the Faith and yet you go against the Faith. You arm yourselves in the name of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and yet fight against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Is this what you have learned from <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? To deny the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to subject the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Word to suffering and death, to make our nature different from His who repaired it, and to reckon all that the cross uplifted, that the spear pierced, that the stone on the tomb received and gave back, to be only the work of Divine power, and not also of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> humility? It is in reference to this humility that the Apostle says, <q>For I do not blush for the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360551"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;1:16</a></span>,</q> inasmuch as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what a slur was cast upon <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by their enemies. And, therefore, the Lord also made proclamation, saying: <q>he that shall confess Me before men him will I also confess before My Father <span class="stiki" id="note360552"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;10:32</a></span> .</q> For these will not be worthy of the Son and the Father's acknowledgment in whom the flesh of Christ awakens no respect: and they will prove themselves to have gained no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a>  who blush to avow with their lips what they have consented to bear upon their brows.</p>

<h2>IX. An exhortation to accept the Catholic view of the Incarnation.</h2>

<p>Give up, my sons, give up these suggestions of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. God's Truth nothing can impair, but the Truth does not save us except in our flesh. For, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is sprung out of the earth ,</q> and the Virgin Mary conceived the Word in such wise that she ministered flesh of her substance to be united to Him without the addition of a second person, and without the disappearance of her nature: seeing that He who was in the form of God took the form of a slave in such wise that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is one and the same in both forms: God bending Himself to the weak things of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and man rising up to the high things of the Godhead, as the Apostle says, <q>whose are the fathers, and from whom, according to the flesh is Christ, who is above all things God blessed for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360555"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;9:5</a></span> .</q></p>
