<h1>Letter 124 (A.D. 411)</h1>

<p> <em>To Albina, Pinianus, and Melania</em>,  <em>Honoured in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, Beloved in Holiness and Longed for in Brotherly Affection, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. I Am, whether through present infirmity or by natural temperament, very susceptible of cold; nevertheless, it would not be possible for me to suffer greater heat than I have done throughout this exceptionally dreadful winter, having been kept in a fever by distress because I have been unable, I do not say to hasten, but to fly to you (to visit whom it would have been fitting for me to fly across the seas), after you had been settled so near to me, and had come from so remote a land to see me. It may be, also, that you have supposed the rigorous weather of this winter to be the only <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of my suffering this disappointment; I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, beloved, give no place to this thought. For what inconvenience, hardship, or even danger, can these heavy rains bring, which I would not have encountered and endured in order to make my way to you, who are such comforters to us in our great calamities, and who, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, are lights kindled into vehement flame by the Supreme Light, raised aloft by lowliness of spirit, and deriving more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> lustre from the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which you have despised? Moreover, I would have enjoyed participation in the spiritual felicity vouchsafed to my earthly birthplace, in that it has been permitted to have you present, of whom when absent its citizens had heard much&mdash; so much, indeed, that although giving charitable credence to the report of what you were by nature and had become by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, they feared, perchance, to repeat it to others, lest it should be disbelieved.</p>

<p>2. I shall therefore tell you the reason why I have not come, and the trials by which I have been kept back from so great a privilege, that I may obtain not only your forgiveness, but also, through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the mercy of Him who so works in you that you live to Him. The congregation of Hippo, whom the Lord has ordained me to serve, is in great measure, and almost wholly, of a constitution so infirm, that the pressure of even a comparatively light affliction might seriously endanger its well-being; at present, however, it is smitten with tribulation so overwhelming, that, even were it strong, it could scarcely survive the imposition of the burden. Moreover, when I returned to it recently, I found it offended to a most dangerous degree by my absence; and you, over whose spiritual strength we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, can with healthful taste relish and approve the saying of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>: <q>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112414"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> I feel this especially because there are many here who by disparaging us attempt to excite against us the minds of the others by whom we seem to be loved, in order that they may make room in them for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But when those whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is our care are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with us, their strong determination to take vengeance on us is only an unreasonable desire for bringing death to themselves&mdash;not the death of the body, but of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in which the fact of death discovers itself mysteriously by the odour of corruption before it is possible for our care to foresee and provide against it.</p>

<p>Doubtless you will readily excuse this anxiety on my part, especially because, if you were displeased and wished to punish me, you could perhaps invent no severer pain than what I already suffer in not seeing you at Thagaste. I trust, however, that, assisted by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I may be permitted when the present hindrance has been removed with all speed to come to you, in whatsoever part of Africa you may be, if this town in which I labour is not worthy (and I do not presume to pronounce it worthy) to be along with us made joyful by your presence.</p>
