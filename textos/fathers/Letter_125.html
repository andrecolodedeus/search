<h1>Letter 125</h1>

<p> <em>To Aphthonius, Theodoritus, Nonnus, Scylacius, Apthonius, Joannes, Magistrates of the Zeugmatensis.</em></p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the strength and stability of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have been filled with the greatest possible delight, for, since we worshippers of the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Trinity constitute one body, it is only natural that together with the members that are sound the rest of the members should <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. So says the divine Apostle; <q>Whether one member be honoured all the members <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with it.</q>  I therefore <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with you in your struggles on behalf of the apostolic doctrines and your following of the famous Naboth in more excellent things. Naboth for his vineyard's sake suffered most unrighteous slaughter, because he would not give up the heritage of his fathers. You are fighting not for vineyards, but for divine doctrines, and reject this new-fangled and spurious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> as blackening the brightness of the teaching of the gospel; you do not suffer the number of the blessed Trinity to be diminished or increased. For it is diminished by those who ascribe the passion of the only begotten to the Godhead; it is increased by those who have the audacity to introduce a second son. You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one only begotten, as you do in one Father and in one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. In the only begotten made flesh you behold the assumed nature which He took from us and offered on our behalf. The denial of this nature puts our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> far from us; for if the Godhead of the only begotten is impassible, as the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Trinity is impassible, and we refuse to acknowledge that which is by nature adapted to suffer, then the preaching of a passion which never happened is idle and vain. For if that which suffers has no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> how could there be a passion? We declare that the divine nature is impassible&mdash;a doctrine confessed by our opponents as well as by ourselves. How then could there be a passion when there is no subject capable of suffering? The great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the &oelig;conomy will appear an appearance, a mere seeming instead of the reality. This is the fable started by <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and Manes. But the teaching handed down to the churches from the beginning recognises, even after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, one Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and confesses the same to be everlasting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and man made at the end of days; made man not by the mutation of the Godhead but by the assumption of the manhood. For suppose the divine nature to have undergone mutation into the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, then it did not remain what it was; and if it is not what it was, they who have these objects of worship are false in calling Him God. We, on the contrary, recognise the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be immutable as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Son of the very God. For we have learned from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> that being in the form of God He took the form of the servant;  and took on Him the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, not was changed into <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> seed; and shared just as we do both in flesh and blood and in a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and immaculate. Preserving these for our sinful bodies He offered His sinless body and for our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> free from all stain. It is for this reason that we have the hope of the common resurrection for the race will assuredly share with its first fruits, and as we have shared with <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> in his death, so too with Christ our Saviour shall we be sharers in His life. This the divine Apostle has plainly taught us, for <q>now</q> he says <q>is Christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead, for as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q> </p>

<p>I write thus not to inform you but to remind you. I have tried to be brief, but I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> I have transgressed the limits of a letter. I was however urged to write by the very reverend and godly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and archimandrite Mecimas, who, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the law of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, has undertaken so long a journey, told us of your excellency's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, and begged us to inflame it by a letter. I have therefore granted his supplication, and written my letter, and I implore the Lord of all to keep you safe in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and make stronger than him who sifts us. </p>
