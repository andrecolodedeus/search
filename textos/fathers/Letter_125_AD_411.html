<h1>Letter 125 (A.D. 411)</h1>

<p> <em>To Alypius, My Lord Most Blessed and Brother Beloved with All Reverence, and My Partner in the Priestly Office, and to the Brethren Who are with Him, Augustine and the Brethren Who are with Him Send Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. We are deeply grieved, and can by no means regard it as a small matter, that the people of Hippo clamorously said so much to the disparagement of your Holiness; but, my good brother, their clamorous utterance of these things is not so great a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for grief as the fact that we are, without open accusation, deemed guilty of similar things. For when we are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be actuated in retaining God's servants among us, not by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of righteousness, but by <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>, is it not to be desired that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this concerning us should with their voices avow what is hidden in their hearts, and so obtain, if possible, remedies great in proportion to the disease, rather than silently perish under the venom of these fatal suspicions? Wherefore it ought to be a greater care to us (and for this reason we conferred together before this happened) to provide how men to whom we are commanded to be examples in good works may be convinced that there is no ground for suspicions which they cherish, than to provide how those may be rebuked who in words give definite utterance to their suspicions.</p>

<p>2. Wherefore I am not <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Albina, nor do I judge her to deserve rebuke; but I think she requires to be cured of such suspicions. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that she has not pointed at myself the words to which I refer, but has complained of the people of Hippo, as it were, alleging that their <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> has been brought to light, and that in desiring to retain among them a man of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> who was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to despise money, and to give it away freely, they were moved, not by his fitness for the office, but by regard to his ample means; nevertheless, she almost said openly that she had the same suspicion of myself, and not she only, but also her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> son-in-law and daughter, who, on that very day, said the same thing in the <a href="../cathen/01659a.htm">apse</a> of the church.  In my opinion, it is more necessary that the suspicions of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be removed than that their utterance of them should be rebuked. For where can immunity and rest from such thorns be provided and given to us, if they can sprout forth against us even in the hearts of intimate friends, so <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and so much beloved by us? It is by the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> multitude that such things have been thought concerning you, but I am the victim of similar suspicions from those who are the lights of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; you may see, therefore, which of us has the greater <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for grief. It seems to me that both cases call, not for invectives, but for remedial measures; for they are men, and their suspicions are of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and therefore such things as they suspect, though they may be false, are not incredible. Persons such as these are of course not so foolish as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the people are <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> their money, especially after their experience that the people of Thagaste obtained none of their money, from which it was certain that the people of Hippo would also obtain none. Nay, all the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of this odium comes against the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> alone, and especially against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whose authority is visibly pre-eminent, and who are supposed to use and enjoy as owners and lords the property of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. My dear Alypius, let not the weak be encouraged through our example to cherish this pernicious and fatal <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Call to mind what we said to each other before the occurrence of this <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, which makes the duty all the more urgent. Let us rather by God's help endeavour to have this difficulty removed by friendly conference, and let us not count it sufficient to be guided by our own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> alone; for this is not one of the cases in which its voice alone is sufficient for our direction. For if we be not unworthy servants of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if there live in us a spark of that charity which seeks not her own, we are bound by all means to provide things honest, not only in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but also in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, lest while drinking untroubled waters in our own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, we be chargeable with treading with incautious feet, and so making the Lord's flock drink from a turbid stream.</p>

<p>3. For as to the proposal in your letter that we should discuss together the obligation of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which has been extorted by force, I beseech you, let not the method of our discussion involve in obscurity things which are perfectly clear. For if inevitable death were threatened in order to compel a servant of God to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> that he would do something forbidden by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> both <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and divine, it would be his duty to prefer death to such an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, lest he should be guilty of a crime in fulfilling his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. But in this case, in which the determined clamour of the people, and only this, was forcing the man, not to a crime, but to that which if it were done would be lawfully done; when, moreover, there was indeed apprehension lest some reckless men, such as are mixed with a multitude even of good men, should through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of rioting break out into some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, if they found a pretext for disturbance and for plausibly justifiable indignation, but there was no certainty of this <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> being realized&mdash;who will affirm that it is lawful to commit a deliberate act of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> in order to escape from uncertain consequences, involving, I shall not say loss or bodily injury, but even death itself? Regulus had not heard anything from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> concerning the impiety of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, he had never heard of the flying roll of Zechariah,  and he confirmed his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to the Carthaginians, not by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but by the abominations of false gods; and yet in the face of inevitable tortures, and a death of unprecedented horror, he was not moved by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> so as to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> under constraint, but, because he had given his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he of his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> submitted to these, lest he should be guilty of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>. In that age, also, the Roman censors refused to inscribe in the roll, not of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> inheriting heavenly <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but of senators received into the curia of Rome, not only men who, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death and of cruel tortures, had chosen rather to commit manifest <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> than to return to merciless enemies, but also one who had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> himself clear of the guilt of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, because, after giving his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he had under the pretext of alleged necessity violated it by returning; in which we see that those who expelled him from the senate took into consideration, not what he himself had in his mind when he gave his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, but what those to whom he pledged his word expected from him. Yet they had never read what we sing continually in the Psalm: <q>He that swears to his own hurt, and changes not.</q>  We are wont to speak of these instances of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with the highest admiration, although they are found in men who were strangers to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and to the name of Christ; and yet do we seriously <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that the question whether <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> is occasionally lawful is one for an answer to which we should search the divine books, in which, to prevent us from falling into this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by inconsiderate oaths, this prohibition is written: <q>Swear not at all</q>?</p>

<p>4. I by no means dispute the perfect correctness of the maxim, that good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> requires an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to be kept, not according to the mere words of him who gives it, but according to that which the person giving the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be the expectation of the person to whom he swears. For it is very difficult to define in words, especially in few words, the promise in regard to which security is exacted from him who gives his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. They, therefore, are guilty of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, who, while adhering to the letter of their promise, disappoint the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> expectation of those to whom their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> was given; and they are not guilty of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, who, even though departing from the letter of the promise, fulfil that which was expected of them when they gave their <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. Wherefore, seeing that the people of Hippo desired to have the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pinianus, not as a prisoner who had forfeited liberty, but as a much-loved resident in their town, the limits of that which they expected from him, though it could not be adequately embraced in the words of his promise, are nevertheless so obvious that the fact of his being at this moment absent, after giving his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to remain among them, does not disturb any one who may have heard that he was to leave this place for a definite purpose, and with the intention of returning. Accordingly, he will not be guilty of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, nor will he be regarded by them as violating his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, unless he disappoint their expectation; and he will not disappoint their expectation, unless he either abandon his purpose of residing among them, or at some future time depart from them without intending to return. May God forbid that he should so depart from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and fidelity which he owes to Christ and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>! For, not to speak of the dread <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> upon <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurers</a>, which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as well as myself, I am perfectly certain that henceforth we shall have no right to be displeased with any one who may refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what we attest by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, if we are found to think that <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> in such a man as Pinianus is to be not only tolerated without indignation, but actually defended. From this may we be saved by the mercy of Him who delivers from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> those who put their trust in Him! Let Pinianus, therefore, as you have written in your communication, fulfil the promise by which he bound himself not to depart from Hippo, just as I myself and the other inhabitants of the town do not depart from it, having, of course, full freedom in going and returning at any time; the only difference being, that those who are not bound by any <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to reside here have it also in their power at any time, without being chargeable with <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, to depart with no purpose of coming back again.</p>

<p>5. As to our <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and the brethren settled in our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it can be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that they either aided or abetted in the reproaches which were made against you. For when I inquired into this, I was informed that only one from our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, a man of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, had taken part in the clamour of the people; and this was not when they were uttering insults against you, but when they were demanding Pinianus as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>.</p>

<p>I have annexed to this letter a copy of the promise given to him, taken from the very paper which he subscribed and corrected under my own inspection.</p>
