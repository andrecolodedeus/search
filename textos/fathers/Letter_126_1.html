<h1>Letter 126</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Atarbius</em>. </p>

<p>On arriving at Nicopolis in the double hope of settling the disturbances which had arisen, and applying a remedy, as far as possible, to measures taken in a disorderly manner and in violation of the law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, I was exceedingly disappointed at failing to meet you. I heard that you had hurriedly withdrawn, and actually from the very synod which was being held by you. I am, therefore, under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of having recourse to writing, and by this letter I bid you present yourself before me, that you may in person apply some remedy to the pain which I felt, even unto death, on hearing that you had ventured on action, in the very middle of the church, of the like of which I hitherto have never heard. All this, although painful and serious, is endurable, as having happened to a man who has committed the punishment due for his sufferings to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is wholly devoted to peace and to preventing harm falling from any fault of his on God's people. Since, however, some <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> brethren, worthy of all credit, have told me that you have introduced certain innovations into the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have spoken against sound doctrine, I am under the circumstances the more agitated, and above measure anxious, lest, in addition to the countless wounds which have been inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by traitors to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, yet a further calamity should spring up in the renewal of the ancient <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Sabellius, the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for to this the brethren have reported your utterances to be akin. I have, therefore, written to charge you not to shrink from undertaking a short journey to come to me, and, by giving me full assurance in the matter, at once to alleviate my pangs, and to solace the Churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which are now pained to a grave, nay an unendurable extent, at your actions and your reported words.</p>
