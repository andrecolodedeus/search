<h1>Letter 127</h1>

<p><strong>To Principia</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This letter is really a memoir of Marcella (for whom see note on Letter XXIII.) addressed to her greatest friend. After describing her history, character, and favourite studies, Jerome goes on to recount her eminent services in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> at a time when, through the efforts of Rufinus, it seemed likely that Origenism would prevail at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> (&sect;&sect;9, 10). He briefly relates the fall of the city and the horrors consequent upon it (&sect;&sect;12, 13) which appear to have been the immediate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Marcella's death (&sect;14). The date of the letter is 412 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. You have besought me often and earnestly, Principia,  virgin of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to dedicate a letter to the memory of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> Marcella,  and to set forth the goodness long enjoyed by us for others to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and to imitate. I am so anxious myself to do <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to her merits that it grieves me that you should spur me on and fancy that your entreaties are needed when I do not yield even to you in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of her. In putting upon record her signal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> I shall receive far more benefit myself than I can possibly confer upon others. If I have hitherto remained silent and have allowed two years to go over without making any sign, this has not been owing to a wish to ignore her as you wrongly suppose, but to an incredible sorrow which so overcame my mind that I judged it better to remain silent for a while than to praise her <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in inadequate language. Neither will I now follow the rules of rhetoric in eulogizing one so dear to both of us and to all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, Marcella the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of her native Rome. I will not set forth her illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> and lofty lineage, nor will I trace her pedigree through a line of consuls and pr&aelig;torian prefects. I will praise her for nothing but the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is her own and which is the more noble, because forsaking both <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and rank she has sought the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nobility of poverty and lowliness.</p>

<p>2. Her father's death left her an orphan, and she had been married less than seven months when her husband was taken from her. Then as she was young, and highborn, as well as distinguished for her beauty&mdash; always an attraction to men&mdash; and her self-control, an illustrious consular named Cerealis paid court to her with great assiduity. Being an old man he offered to make over to her his fortune so that she might consider herself less his wife than his daughter. Her mother Albina went out of her way to secure for the young <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> so exalted a protector. But Marcella answered: <q>had I a wish to marry and not rather to dedicate myself to perpetual <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, I should look for a husband and not for an inheritance;</q> and when her suitor argued that sometimes old men live long while young men die early, she cleverly retorted: <q>a young man may indeed die early, but an old man cannot live long.</q> This decided rejection of Cerealis convinced others that they had no hope of winning her hand.</p>

<p>In the gospel according to Luke we read the following passage: <q>there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; and she was a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple but served God with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> night and day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303524"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;2:36-37</a></span> It was no marvel that she won the vision of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, whom she sought so earnestly. Let us then compare her case with that of Marcella and we shall see that the latter has every way the advantage. Anna lived with her husband seven years; Marcella seven months. Anna only hoped for Christ; Marcella held Him fast. Anna confessed him at His birth; Marcella <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him crucified. Anna did not deny the Child; Marcella rejoiced in the Man as king. I do not wish to draw distinctions between <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> on the score of their merits, as some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have made it a custom to do as regards <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men and leaders of churches; the conclusion at which I aim is that, as both have one task, so both have one reward.</p>

<p>3. In a slander-loving community such as Rome, filled as it formerly was with people from all parts and bearing the palm for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of all kinds, detraction assailed the upright and strove to defile even the pure and the clean. In such an atmosphere it is hard to escape from the breath of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>. A stainless <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> is difficult nay almost impossible to attain; the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> yearns for it but hardly hopes to win it: <q>Blessed,</q> he says, <q>are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the Lord.</q>  The undefiled in the way of this world are those whose fair fame no breath of scandal has ever sullied, and who have earned no reproach at the hands of their neighbours. It is this which makes the Saviour say in the gospel: <q>agree with,</q> or be complaisant to, <q>your adversary while you are in the way with him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303526"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;5:25</a></span> Who ever heard a <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> of Marcella that deserved the least credit? Or who ever credited such without making himself guilty of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and defamation? No; she put the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to confusion by showing them the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> widowhood which her <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and mien alike set forth. For <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the world are wont to paint their faces with rouge and white-lead, to wear robes of shining silk, to adorn themselves with jewels, to put gold chains round their necks, to pierce their ears and hang in them the costliest pearls of the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>,  and to scent themselves with musk. While they mourn for the husbands they have lost they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at their own deliverance and freedom to choose fresh partners&mdash; not, as God wills, to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> these <span class="stiki" id="note303528"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse22">Ephesians&nbsp;5:22</a></span> but to rule over them.</p>

<p>With this object in view they select for their partners poor men who contented with the mere name of husbands are the more ready to put up with rivals as they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, if they so much as murmur, they will be cast off at once. Our <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> clothing was meant to keep out the cold and not to show her figure. Of gold she would not wear so much as a seal-ring, choosing to store her money in the stomachs of the poor rather than to keep it at her own disposal. She went nowhere without her mother, and would never see without witnesses such <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as the needs of a large house required her to interview. Her train was always composed of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> serious and staid; for, as she well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, the levity of the maids speaks ill for the mistress and a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> character is shown by her choice of companions. </p>

<p>4. Her delight in the divine scriptures was incredible. She was for ever singing, <q>Your words have I hid in mine heart that I might not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against you,</q>  as well as the words which describe the perfect man, <q>his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law does he meditate day and night.</q>  This meditation in the law she understood not of a review of the written words as among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> think, but of action according to that saying of the apostle, <q>whether, therefore, you eat or drink or what soever you do, do all to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303532"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:31</a></span> She remembered also the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words, <q>through your precepts I get understanding,</q>  and felt sure that only when she had fulfilled these would she be permitted to understand the scriptures. In this sense we read elsewhere that <q>Jesus began both to do and teach.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303534"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;1:1</a></span> For teaching is put to the blush when a man's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> rebukes him; and it is in vain that his tongue preaches poverty or teaches <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a> if he is rolling in the riches of Cr&oelig;sus and if, in spite of his threadbare cloak, he has silken robes at home to save from the moth.</p>

<p>Marcella practised <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, but in moderation. She abstained from eating flesh, and she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> rather the scent of wine than its taste; touching it only for her stomach's sake and for her often infirmities. <span class="stiki" id="note303535"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:23</a></span> She seldom appeared in public and took care to avoid the houses of great ladies, that she might not be forced to look upon what she had once for all renounced. She frequented the basilicas of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> that she might escape from the throng and give herself to private <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. So <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> was she to her mother that for her sake she did things of which she herself disapproved. For example, when her mother, careless of her own offspring, was for transferring all her property from her children and grandchildren to her brother's <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, Marcella wished the money to be given to the poor instead, and yet could not bring herself to thwart her parent. Therefore she made over her ornaments and other effects to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> already rich, content to throw away her money rather than to sadden her mother's heart.</p>

<p>5. In those days no highborn lady at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> had made profession of the monastic life, or had ventured&mdash; so strange and ignominious and degrading did it then seem&mdash; publicly to call herself a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>. It was from some <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of Alexandria, and from pope Athanasius, and subsequently from Peter,  who, to escape the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, had all fled for refuge to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the safest haven in which they could find communion&mdash; it was from these that Marcella heard of the life of the blessed Antony, then still alive, and of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the Thebaid founded by Pachomius, and of the discipline laid down for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and for <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. Nor was she ashamed to profess a life which she had thus learned to be pleasing to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Many years after her example was followed first by Sophronia and then by others, of whom it may be well said in the words of Ennius: </p>

<blockquote><p>Would that ne'er in Pelion's woods
<br>Had the axe these pinetrees felled.</p></blockquote>

<p>My revered friend <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> was blessed with Marcella's friendship, and it was in Marcella's cell that <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, that paragon of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, was gradually trained. Thus it is easy to see of what type the mistress was who found such pupils.</p>

<p>The unbelieving reader may perhaps laugh at me for dwelling so long on the praises of mere <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; yet if he will but remember how <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> followed our Lord and Saviour and ministered to Him of their substance, and how the three Marys stood before the cross and especially how Mary Magdalen&mdash; called the tower  from the earnestness and glow of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>&mdash; was privileged to see the rising Christ first of all before the very <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, he will convict himself of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> sooner than me of folly. For we judge of people's <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> not by their sex but by their character, and hold those to be worthy of the highest <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> who have renounced both rank and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. It was for this reason that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> loved the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John more than the other <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. For John was of noble birth  and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, yet was so little appalled by the plottings of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that he introduced Peter into his court,  and was the only one of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> bold enough to take his stand before the cross. For it was he who took the Saviour's parent to his own home; <span class="stiki" id="note303541"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse26">John&nbsp;19:26-27</a></span> it was the virgin son  who received the virgin mother as a legacy from the Lord.</p>

<p>6. Marcella then lived the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life for many years, and found herself old before she bethought herself that she had once been young. She often quoted with approval <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> saying that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> consists in meditating on death.  A <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which our own apostle endorses when he says: <q>for your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> I die daily.</q>  Indeed according to the old copies our Lord himself says: <q>whosoever does not bear His cross daily and come after me cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</q>  Ages before, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> had said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>: <q>for your sake are we killed all the day long: we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</q>  Many generations afterwards the words were spoken: <q>remember the end and you shall never do amiss,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303547"><a href="../bible/sir007.htm#verse36">Sirach&nbsp;7:36</a></span> as well as that precept of the eloquent satirist: <q>live with death in your mind; time flies; this say of mine is so much taken from it.</q>  Well then, as I was saying, she passed her days and lived always in the thought that she must die. Her very clothing was such as to remind her of the tomb, and she presented herself as a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, reasonable and acceptable, unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note303549"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;12:1</a></span> </p>

<p>7. When the needs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at length brought me to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>  in company with the reverend pontiffs, Paulinus and Epiphanius&mdash; the first of whom ruled the church of the Syrian <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> while the second presided over that of Salamis in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>&mdash;I in my modesty was for avoiding the eyes of highborn ladies, yet she pleaded so earnestly, <q>both in season and out of season</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303551"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:2</a></span> as the apostle says, that at last her perseverance overcame my reluctance. And, as in those days my name was held in some renown as that of a student of the scriptures, she never came to see me that she did not ask me some question concerning them, nor would she at once acquiesce in my explanations but on the contrary would dispute them; not, however, for argument's sake but to learn the answers to those objections which might, as she saw, be made to my statements. How much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and ability, how much <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and purity I found in her I am afraid to say; both lest I may exceed the bounds of men's belief and lest I may increase your sorrow by reminding you of the blessings that you have lost. This much only will I say, that whatever in me was the fruit of long study and as such made by constant meditation a part of my nature, this she tasted, this she learned and made her own. Consequently after my departure from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, in case of a dispute arising as to the testimony of scripture on any subject, recourse was had to her to settle it. And so wise was she and so well did she understand what <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> call <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x1F79; &#x03C0;&#x03C1;&#x1F73;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span>, that is, the becoming, in what she did, that when she answered questions she gave her own opinion not as her own but as from me or some one else, thus admitting that what she taught she had herself learned from others. For she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the apostle had said: <q>I suffer not a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to teach,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303552"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:12</a></span> and she would not seem to inflict a wrong upon the male sex many of whom (including sometimes <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>) questioned her concerning obscure and doubtful points.</p>

<p>8. I am told that my place with her was immediately taken by you, that you attached yourself to her, and that, as the saying goes, you never let even a hair's-breadth  come between her and you. You both lived in the same house and occupied the same room so that every one in the city <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> for certain that you had found a mother in her and she a daughter in you. In the suburbs you found for yourselves a monastic seclusion, and chose the country instead of the town because of its loneliness. For a long time you lived together, and as many ladies shaped their conduct by your examples, I had the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of seeing Rome transformed into another Jerusalem. Monastic establishments for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> became numerous, and of hermits there were countless numbers. In fact so many were the servants of God that monasticism which had before been a term of reproach became subsequently one of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. Meantime we consoled each other for our separation by words of mutual encouragement, and discharged in the spirit the debt which in the flesh we could not pay. We always went to meet each other's letters, tried to outdo each other in attentions, and anticipated each other in courteous inquiries. Not much was lost by a separation thus effectually bridged by a constant correspondence.</p>

<p>9. While Marcella was thus serving the Lord in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> tranquillity, there arose in these provinces a tornado of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which threw everything into confusion; indeed so great was the fury into which it lashed itself that it spared neither itself nor anything that was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. And as if it were too little to have disturbed everything here, it introduced a ship  freighted with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> into the port of Rome itself. The dish soon found itself a cover;  and the muddy feet of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> fouled the clear waters <span class="stiki" id="note303556"><a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse18">Ezekiel&nbsp;34:18</a></span> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Rome. No wonder that in the streets and in the market places a soothsayer can strike fools on the back or, catching up his cudgel, shatter the teeth of such as carp at him; when such venomous and filthy teaching as this has found at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> dupes whom it can lead astray. Next came the scandalous version  of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> book <em>On First Principles</em>, and that 'fortunate' <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>  who would have been indeed fortunate had he never fallen in with such a master. Next followed the confutation set forth by my supporters, which destroyed the case of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>  and threw them into confusion. It was then that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Marcella, who had long held back lest she should be thought to act from party motives, threw herself into the breach. Conscious that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Rome&mdash; once praised by an apostle <span class="stiki" id="note303560"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;1:8</a></span> &mdash; was now in danger, and that this new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was drawing to itself not only <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> but also many of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> besides imposing on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>  who fancied others as guileless as he was himself, she publicly withstood its teachers choosing to please God rather than men.</p>

<p>10. In the gospel the Saviour commends the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> steward because, although he defrauded his master, he acted wisely for his own interests. <span class="stiki" id="note303562"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;16:8</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in this instance pursued the same course; for, seeing how great a matter a little fire had kindled, <span class="stiki" id="note303563"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse5">James&nbsp;3:5</a></span> and that the flames applied by them to the foundations had by this time reached the housetops, and that the deception practised on many could no longer be hid, they asked for and obtained letters of commendation from the church,  so that it might appear that till the day of their departure they had continued in full communion with it. Shortly afterwards  the distinguished Anastasius succeeded to the pontificate; but he was soon taken away, for it was not fitting that the head of the world should be struck off  during the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of one so great. He was removed, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that he might not seek to turn away by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the sentence of God passed once for all. For the words of the Lord to Jeremiah concerning <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> applied equally to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> not for this people for their good. When they fast I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and oblation, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303567"><a href="../bible/jer014.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;14:11-12</a></span> You will say, what has this to do with the praises of Marcella? I reply, She it was who originated the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. She it was who furnished witnesses first taught by them and then carried away by their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching. She it was who showed how large a number they had deceived and who brought up against them the impious books <em>On First Principles</em>, books which were passing from hand to hand after being 'improved' by the hand of the scorpion.  She it was lastly who called on the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in letter after letter to appear in their own defence. They did not indeed venture to come, for they were so conscience-stricken that they let the case go against them by default rather than face their accusers and be convicted by them. This <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> victory originated with Marcella, she was the source and <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this great blessing. You who shared the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> with her <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> too that out of many incidents I only mention a few, not to tire out the reader by a wearisome recapitulation. Were I to say more, ill natured <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> might fancy me, under pretext of commending a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, to be giving vent to my own rancour. I will pass now to the remainder of my story.</p>

<p>11. The whirlwind  passed from the West into the East and threatened in its passage to shipwreck many a noble craft. Then were the words of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> fulfilled: <q>when the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a> comes, shall he find <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the earth?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303570"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;18:8</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many waxed cold.  Yet the few who still loved the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> rallied to my side. Men openly sought to take their lives and every expedient was employed against them. So hotly indeed did the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> rage that <q>Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation;</q>  nay more he committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, if not in actual <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> at least in will. Then behold God blew and the tempest passed away; so that the prediction of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was fulfilled, <q>you take away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.  In that very day his thoughts perish,</q>  as also the gospel-saying, <q>You fool, this night your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be required of you: then whose shall those things be, which you have provided?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303575"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;12:20</a></span> </p>

<p>12. Whilst these things were happening in Jebus  a dreadful rumour came from the West. Rome had been besieged  and its citizens had been forced to buy their lives with gold. Then thus despoiled they had been besieged again so as to lose not their substance only but their lives. My voice sticks in my throat; and, as I dictate, sobs choke my utterance. The City which had taken the whole world was itself taken;  nay more famine was beforehand with the sword and but few citizens were left to be made captives. In their frenzy the starving people had recourse to hideous food; and tore each other limb from limb that they might have flesh to eat. Even the mother did not spare the babe at her breast. In the night was Moab taken, in the night did her wall fall down. <span class="stiki" id="note303579"><a href="../bible/isa015.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;15:1</a></span> <q>O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> have come into your inheritance; your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple have they defiled; they have made Jerusalem an orchard.  The dead bodies of your servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of your <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> unto the beasts of the earth. Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them.</q> </p>

<blockquote><p>Who can set forth the carnage of that night?
<br>What tears are equal to its agony?
<br>Of ancient date a sovran city falls;
<br>And lifeless in its streets and houses lie
<br>Unnumbered bodies of its citizens.
<br>In many a ghastly shape does death appear. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>13. Meantime, as was natural in a scene of such confusion, one of the bloodstained victors found his way into Marcella's house. Now be it mine to say what I have heard,  to relate what <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men have seen; for there were some such present and they say that you too were with her in the hour of danger. When the soldiers entered she is said to have received them without any look of alarm; and when they asked her for gold she pointed to her coarse dress to show them that she had no buried treasure. However they would not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in her self-chosen poverty, but scourged her and beat her with cudgels. She is said to have felt no pain but to have thrown herself at their feet and to have pleaded with tears for you, that you might not be taken from her, or owing to your youth have to endure what she as an old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had no occasion to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Christ softened their hard hearts and even among bloodstained swords natural affection asserted its rights. The barbarians conveyed both you and her to the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that you might find there either a place of safety or, if not that, at least a tomb. Hereupon Marcella is said to have burst into great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and to have thanked God for having kept you unharmed in answer to her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. She said she was thankful too that the taking of the city had found her poor, not made her so, that she was now in want of daily bread, that Christ satisfied her needs so that she no longer felt hunger, that she was able to say in word and in deed: <q>naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there: the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.</q> </p>

<p>14. After a few days she fell asleep in the Lord; but to the last her powers remained unimpaired. You she made the heir of her poverty, or rather the poor through you. When she closed her eyes, it was in your arms; when she breathed her last breath, your lips received it; you shed tears but she smiled conscious of having led a good life and hoping for her reward hereafter.</p>

<p>In one short night I have dictated this letter in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of you, revered Marcella, and of you, my daughter Principia; not to show off my own eloquence but to express my heartfelt gratitude to you both; my one desire has been to please both God and my readers.</p>
