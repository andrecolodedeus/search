<h1>Letter 12</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. GREGORY OF NYSSA</em></strong></p>

<p> <em>On his work against Eunomius</em></p>

<p>We Cappadocians are poor in nearly all things that make the possessors of them <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, but above all we are badly off for people who are able to write. This, be sure, is the reason why I am so slow about sending you a letter: for, though my reply to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (of Eunomius) had been long ago completed, there was no one to transcribe it. Such a dearth of writers it was that brought upon us the suspicion of sluggishness or of inability to frame an answer. But since now at any rate, thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the writer and reviser have come, I have sent this treatise to you; not, as Isocrates says , as a present, for I do not reckon it to be such that it should be received in lieu of something of substantial value, but that it may be in our power to cheer on those who are in the full vigour of youth to do battle with the enemy, by stirring up the naturally sanguine temperament of early life. But if any portion of the treatise should appear worthy of serious consideration, after examining some parts, especially those prefatory to the <q>trials,</q>  and those which are of the same cast, and perhaps also some of the doctrinal parts of the book, you will think them not ungratefully composed. But to whatever conclusion you come, you will of course read them, as to a teacher and corrector, to those who do not act like the players at ball , when they stand in three different places and throw it from one to the other, aiming it exactly and catching one ball from one and one from another, and they baffle the player who is in the middle, as he jumps up to catch it, pretending that they are going to throw with a made-up expression of face, and such and such a motion of the hand to left or right, and whichever way they see him hurrying, they send the ball just the contrary way, and cheat his expectation by a trick. This holds even now in the case of most of us, who, dropping all serious purpose, play at being good-natured , as if at ball, with men, instead of realizing the favourable hope which we hold out, beguiling to sinister  issues the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of those who repose confidence in us. Letters of reconciliation, caresses, tokens, presents, affectionate embrace by letters&mdash; these are the making as if to throw with the ball to the right. But instead of the pleasure which one expects therefrom, one gets accusations, plots, <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>, disparagement, charges brought against one, bits of a sentence torn from their context, caught up, and turned to one's hurt. Blessed in your hopes are you, who through all such trials exercise confidence towards God. But we beseech you not to look at our words, but to the teaching of our Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For what consolation to one in anguish can another be, who surpasses him in the extremity of his own anguish, to help his luckless fortunes to obtain their proper issue? As He says, <q>Vengeance is Mine; I will repay, says the Lord.</q> But do you, best of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, go on in a manner worthy of yourself, and trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do not be hindered by the spectacle of our misfortunes from being good and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but commit to God that judges righteously the suitable and just issue of events, and act as Divine wisdom guides you. Assuredly Joseph had in the result no reason to grieve at the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of his brethren, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of his own kith and kin became to him the road to empire.</p>
