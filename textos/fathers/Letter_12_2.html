<h1>Letter 12</h1>

<p><strong>To Antony, Monk</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The subject of this letter is similar to that of the preceding. Of Antony nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> except that some manuscripts describe him as <q>of &AElig;mona.</q> The date of the letter is 374 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>While the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were disputing concerning precedence our Lord, the teacher of humility, took a little child and said: <q>Unless you are converted and become as little children ye cannot enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300158"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;18:3</a></span> And lest He should seem to preach more than he practised, He fulfilled His own precept in His life. For He washed His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet, <span class="stiki" id="note300159"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;13:5</a></span> he received the traitor with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300160"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;22:47</a></span> He conversed with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300161"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;4:7</a></span> He spoke of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> with Mary at His feet,  and when He rose again from the dead He showed Himself first to some poor <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>.  Pride is opposed to humility, and through it <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> lost his eminence as an archangel. The Jewish people perished in their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, for while they claimed the chief seats and salutations in the market place, <span class="stiki" id="note300164"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;23:6-7</a></span> they were superseded by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, who had before been counted as <q>a drop of a bucket.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300165"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;40:15</a></span> Two poor fishermen, Peter and James, were sent to confute the sophists and the wise men of the world. As the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300166"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Think, brother, what a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it must be which has God for its opponent. In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> is rejected because of his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> is accepted because of his humility. </p>

<p>Now, unless I am mistaken, I have already sent you ten letters, affectionate and earnest, while you have not deigned to give me even a single line. The Lord speaks to His servants, but you, my brother servant, refuse to speak to me. Believe me, if reserve did not check my pen, I could show my annoyance in such invective that you would have to reply&mdash; even though it might be in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. But since <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> must not act injuriously, I fall back once more on entreaty, and beg you to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one who loves you, and to write to him as a servant should to his fellow-servant. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
