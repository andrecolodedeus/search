<h1>Letter 130</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Theodotus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Nicopolis</em>.</p>

<p>1. You have very rightly and properly blamed me, right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and well beloved brother, in that ever since I departed from your reverence, conveying to Eustathius those propositions about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I have told you neither much nor little about his business. This neglect is really not due to any contempt on my part for the way in which he has treated me, but simply to the fact that the story is now published abroad in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> ears, and nobody needs any instructions from me in order to learn what his intentions are. For this he has had good heed, as though he were really afraid that he would have few witnesses of his opinion, and has sent to the ends of the earth the letter which he has written against me. He has therefore severed himself from communion with me. He did not consent to meet me at the appointed spot, and did not bring his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as he had promised. On the contrary, he publicly stigmatized me in the public synods, with the Cilician Theophilus,  by the open and undisguised <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> of sowing in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the people doctrines at variance with his own teaching. This was quite enough to break up all union between us. Afterwards he came to Cilicia, and, on meeting with a certain Gelasius, showed him the creed which only an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, or a thorough <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, could subscribe. Then, indeed, I was yet more confirmed in my alienation from him. I felt that the <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> will never change his skin, nor the leopard his spots,  nor a man nurtured in doctrines of perversity ever be able to rub off the stain of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>2. In addition to all this he has had the impudence to write against me, or rather to compose long discourses full of all kinds of abuse and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>. To these, up to this time, I have answered nothing, taught as we are by the Apostle, not to avenge ourselves, but to give place unto <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note322433"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;12:19</a></span> Moreover, at the thought of the depth of the hypocrisy with which he has all along approached me, I have, in a way, become speechless with amazement. But, if all this had never happened, who would not feel horror and detestation of the fellow at this fresh piece of audacity? Now, as I hear, if the report is really <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and not a <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> invention, he has ventured to re-ordain certain men; a proceeding on which so far no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> has ventured. How then can I quietly endure such treatment? How can I look upon the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the man as curable? Beware, then, of being led away by lies; do not be moved by the suspicions of men who are prone to look at everything in a bad light, as though I were making little of such things. For, be sure, my very dear and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> friend, that I have never at any time been so grieved as I am now, on hearing of this confusion of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Pray only that the Lord grant me to take no step in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, but to maintain charity, which behaves itself not unseemly and is not puffed up.  Only look how men without charity have been lifted up beyond all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bounds and conduct themselves in an unseemly manner, daring <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which have no precedent in all the past. </p>
