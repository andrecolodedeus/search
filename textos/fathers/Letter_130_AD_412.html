<h1>Letter 130 (A.D. 412)</h1>

<p> <em>To Proba</em>,  <em>a Devoted Handmaid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Bishop Augustine, a Servant of Christ and of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Servants, Sends Greeting in the Name of the Lord of Lords.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. Recollecting your request and my promise, that as soon as time and opportunity should be given by Him to whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, I would write you something on the subject  of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I feel it my duty now to discharge this debt, and in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ to minister to the satisfaction of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> desire. I cannot express in words how greatly I rejoiced because of the request, in which I perceived how great is your solicitude about this supremely important matter. For what could be more suitably the business of your widowhood than to continue in supplications night and day, according to the apostle's admonition, <q>She that is a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> indeed, and desolate, trusts in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and continues in supplications night and day</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note112421"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:5</a></span> It might, indeed, appear wonderful that solicitude about <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should occupy your heart and claim the first place in it, when you are, so far as this world is concerned, noble and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, and the mother of such an illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and, although a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, not desolate, were it not that you wisely understand that in this world and in this life the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has no sure portion.</p>

<p>2. Wherefore He who inspired you with this thought is assuredly doing what He promised to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when they were grieved, not for themselves, but for the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and were despairing of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of any one, after they heard from Him that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. He gave them this marvellous and merciful reply: <q>The things which are impossible with men are possible with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112422"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21-26</a></span> He, therefore, with whom it is possible to make even the rich enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, inspired you with that devout anxiety which makes you think it necessary to ask my counsel on the question how you ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. For while He was yet on earth, He brought Zaccheus, <span class="stiki" id="note112423"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;19:9</a></span> though rich, into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, and, after being <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> and ascension, He made many who were rich to despise this present world, and made them more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> rich by extinguishing their desire for riches through His imparting to them His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For how could you desire so much to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God if you did not trust in Him? And how could you trust in Him if you were fixing your trust in uncertain riches, and neglecting the wholesome exhortation of the apostle: <q>Charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gives us richly all things to enjoy; that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, laying up in store for themselves a good foundation, that they may lay hold on <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note112424"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:17-19</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>3. It becomes you, therefore, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, to account yourself <q>desolate</q> in this world, however great the prosperity of your lot may be. For as that is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, in comparison with which the present life, which is much loved, is not worthy to be called life, however <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and prolonged it be, so is it also the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> consolation promised by the Lord in the words of Isaiah, <q>I will give him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> consolation, peace upon peace,</q>  without which consolation men find themselves, in the midst of every mere earthly solace, rather desolate than comforted. For as for riches and high rank, and all other things in which men who are strangers to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> felicity <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> exists, what comfort do they bring, seeing that it is better to be independent of such things than to enjoy abundance of them, because, when possessed, they occasion, through our <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of losing them, more vexation than was caused by the strength of desire with which their possession was <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a>? Men are not made good by possessing these so-called <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, but, if men have become good otherwise, they make these things to be really good by using them well. Therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> comfort is to be found not in them, but rather in those things in which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life is found. For a man can be made blessed only by the same power by which he is made good.</p>

<p>4. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, indeed, that good men are seen to be the sources of no small comfort to others in this world. For if we be harassed by poverty, or saddened by bereavement, or disquieted by bodily pain, or pining in exile, or vexed by any kind of calamity, let good men visit us, men who can not only <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with them that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, but also weep with them that weep, <span class="stiki" id="note112426"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;12:15</a></span> and who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give profitable counsel, and win us to express our feelings in conversation: the effect is, that rough things become smooth, heavy burdens are lightened, and difficulties vanquished most wonderfully. But this is done in and through them by Him who has made them good by His Spirit. On the other hand, although riches may abound, and no bereavement befal us, and health of body be enjoyed, and we live in our own country in peace and safety, if, at the same time, we have as our neighbours <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, among whom there is not one who can be trusted, not one from whom we do not apprehend and experience treachery, deceit, outbursts of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, dissensions, and snares, in such a case are not all these other things made bitter and vexatious, so that nothing sweet or pleasant is left in them? Whatever, therefore, be our circumstances in this world, there is nothing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> enjoyable without a friend. But how rarely is one found in this life about whose spirit and behaviour as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friend there may be perfect confidence! For no one is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to another so intimately as he is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to himself, and yet no one is so well known even to himself that he can be sure as to his own conduct on the morrow; wherefore, although many are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their fruits, and some gladden their neighhours by their good lives, while others grieve their neighbours by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> lives, yet the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are so unknown and so unstable, that there is the highest wisdom in the exhortation of the apostle: <q>Judge nothing before the time until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112427"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> </p>

<p>5. In the darkness, then, of this world, in which we are pilgrims absent from the Lord as long as <q>we walk by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and not by sight,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112428"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:6-7</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> ought to feel itself desolate, and continue in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and learn to fix the eye of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> on the word of the divine sacred Scriptures, as <q>on a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in our hearts.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112429"><a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:19</a></span> For the ineffable source from which this lamp borrows its light is the Light which shines in darkness, but the darkness comprehends it not&mdash; the Light, in order to seeing which our hearts must be purified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for <q>blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112430"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> and <q>we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that when He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112431"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> Then after death shall come the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, and after desolation the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> consolation, that life shall deliver our <q><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from death</q> that consolation shall deliver our <q>eyes from tears,</q> and, as follows in the psalm, our feet shall be delivered from falling; for there shall be no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> there.  Moreover, if there be no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, there will be no <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; for there we shall not be waiting for promised blessings, but contemplating the blessings actually bestowed; wherefore he adds, <q>I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living,</q>  where we shall then be&mdash; not in the wilderness of the dead, where we now are: <q>For you are dead,</q> says the apostle, <q>and your life is hid with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; when Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with Him in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112434"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse3">Colossians&nbsp;3:3-4</a></span> For that is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life on which the rich are exhorted to lay hold by being rich in good works; and in it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> consolation, for want of which, meanwhile, a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is <q>desolate</q> indeed, even though she has sons and grandchildren, and conducts her household piously, entreating all dear to her to put their hope in God: and in the midst of all this, she says in her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> thirsts for You; my flesh longs in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</q>  and this dying life is nothing else than such a land, however numerous our mortal comforts, however pleasant our companions in the pilgrimage, and however great the abundance of our possessions. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how uncertain all these things are; and even if they were not uncertain, what would they be in comparison with the felicity which is promised in the life to come!</p>

<p>6. In saying these things to you, who, being a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, rich and noble, and the mother of an illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, have asked from me a discourse on <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, my aim has been to make you feel that, even while your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> are spared to you, and live as you would desire, you are desolate so long as you have not attained to that life in which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and abiding consolation, in which shall be fulfilled what is spoken in <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>: <q>We are satisfied in the morning with Your mercy, we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and are glad all our days; we are made glad according to the days wherein You have afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>7. Wherefore, until that consolation come, remember, in order to your <q>continuing in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications night and day,</q> that, however great the temporal prosperity may be which flows around you, you are desolate. For the apostle does not ascribe this gift to every <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, but to her who, being a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> indeed, and desolate, <q>trusts in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and continues in supplication night and day.</q> Observe, however, most vigilantly the warning which follows: <q>But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112437"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:5-6</a></span> for a person lives in those things which he loves, which he greatly desires, and in which he believes himself to be blessed. Wherefore, what Scripture has said of riches: <q>If riches increase, set not your heart upon them,</q>  I say to you concerning pleasures: <q>If pleasures increase, set not your heart upon them.</q> Do not, therefore, think highly of yourself because these things are not wanting, but are yours abundantly, flowing, as it were, from a most copious fountain of earthly felicity. By all means look upon your possession of these things with indifference and contempt, and seek nothing from them beyond health of body. For this is a blessing not to be despised, because of its being necessary to the work of life until <q>this mortal shall have put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note112439"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:54</a></span> in other words, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, perfect, and everlasting health, which is neither reduced by earthly infirmities nor repaired by corruptible gratification, but, enduring with celestial rigour, is animated with a life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> incorruptible. For the apostle himself says, <q>Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112440"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;13:14</a></span> because we must take care of the flesh, but only in so far as is necessary for health; <q>For no man ever yet <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> his own flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112441"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse39">Ephesians&nbsp;5:39</a></span> as he himself likewise says. Hence, also, he admonished Timothy, who was, as it appears, too severe upon his body, that he should <q>use a little wine for his stomach's sake, and for his often infirmities.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112442"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:23</a></span> </p>

<p>8. Many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, using every precaution against those pleasures in which she that lives, cleaving to them, and dwelling in them as her heart's delight, is dead while she lives, have cast from them that which is as it were the mother of pleasures, by distributing their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> among the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and so have stored it in the safer keeping of the treasury of heaven. If you are <em>hindered</em> from doing this by some consideration of duty to your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourself what account you can give to God of your use of riches. For no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what passes within a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <q>but the spirit of the man which is in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112443"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> We ought not to judge anything <q>before the time until the Lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112444"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> It pertains, therefore, to your care as a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, to see to it that if pleasures increase you do not set your heart upon them, lest that which ought to rise that it may live, die through contact with their corrupting influence. Reckon yourself to be one of those of whom it is written, <q>Their hearts shall live for ever.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>9. You have now heard what manner of person you should be if you would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>; hear, in the next place, what you ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for. This is the subject on which you have thought it most necessary to ask my opinion, because you were disturbed by the words of the apostle: <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112446"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;8:26</a></span> and you became alarmed lest it should do you more harm to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> otherwise than you ought, than to desist from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> altogether. A short solution of your difficulty may be given thus: <q>Pray for a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life.</q> This all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> wish to have; for even those whose lives are worst and most abandoned would by no means live thus, unless they thought that in this way they either were made or might be made <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>. Now what else ought we to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for than that which both bad and good desire, but which only the good obtain?</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>10. You ask, perchance, What is this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life? On this question the talents and leisure of many <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> have been wasted, who, nevertheless, failed in their researches after it just in proportion as they failed to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Him from whom it proceeds, and were unthankful to Him. In the first place, then, consider whether we should accept the opinion of those <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who pronounce that man <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who lives according to his own will. Far be it, surely, from us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this; for what if a man's will inclines him to live in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? Is he not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be a miserable man in proportion to the facility with which his depraved will is carried out? Even <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who were strangers to the worship of God have rejected this sentiment with deserved abhorrence. One of them, a man of the greatest eloquence, says: <q>Behold, however, others, not <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> indeed, but men of ready power in disputation, who affirm that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> are <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who live according to their own will. But this is certainly untrue, for to wish that which is unbecoming is itself a most miserable thing; nor is it so miserable a thing to fail in obtaining what you wish as to wish to obtain what you ought not to desire.</q>  What is your opinion? Are not these words, by whomsoever they are spoken, derived from the Truth itself? We may therefore here say what the apostle said of a certain Cretan poet  whose sentiment had pleased him: <q>This <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112449"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse13">Titus&nbsp;1:13</a></span> </p>

<p>11. He, therefore, is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who has all that he wishes to have, and wishes to have nothing which he ought not to wish. This being understood, let us now observe what things men may without impropriety wish to have. One desires marriage; another, having become a widower, chooses thereafter to live a life of continence; a third chooses to practise continence though he is married. And although of these three conditions one may be found better than another, we cannot say that any one of the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> is wishing what he ought not: the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the desire for children as the fruit of marriage, and for life and health to be enjoyed by the children who have been received&mdash;of which desires the latter is one with which <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> remaining unmarried are for the most part occupied; for although, refusing a second marriage, they do not now wish to have children, they wish that the children that they have may live in health. From all such care those who preserve their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> intact are free. Nevertheless, all have some dear to them whose temporal welfare they do without impropriety desire. But when men have obtained this health for themselves, and for those whom they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, are we at liberty to say that they are now <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>? They have, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, something which it is quite becoming to desire; but if they have not other things which are greater, better, and more full both of utility and beauty, they are still far short of possessing a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>12. Shall we then say, that in addition to this health of body men may desire for themselves and for those dear to them <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and power? By all means, if they desire these in order that by obtaining them they may promote the interest of those who may be their dependants. If they seek these things not for the sake of the things themselves, but for some good thing which may through this means be accomplished, the wish is a proper one; but if it be merely for the empty gratification of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and arrogance, and for a superfluous and pernicious triumph of vanity, the wish is improper. Wherefore, men do nothing wrong in desiring for themselves and for their kindred the competent portion of necessary things, of which the apostle speaks when he says: <q>Godliness with a competency [contentment] is great gain; for we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out: and having food and raiment, let us be therewith content. But they that will be rich fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, which drown men in destruction and perdition; for the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which while some <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> after, they have erred from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112450"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:6-10</a></span> This competent portion he desires without impropriety who desires it and nothing beyond it; for if his desires go beyond it, he is not desiring it, and therefore his desire is improper. This was desired, and was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for by him who said: <q>Give me neither poverty nor riches: feed me with food convenient for me: lest I be full, and deny You, and say, Who is the Lord? Or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112451"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse8">Proverbs&nbsp;30:8-9</a></span> You see assuredly that this competency is desired not for its own sake, but to secure the health of the body, and such provision of house and clothing as is befitting the man's circumstances, that he may appear as he ought to do among those among whom he has to live, so as to retain their respect and discharge the duties of his position.</p>

<p>13. Among all these things, our own welfare and the benefits which friendship bids us ask for others are things to be desired on their own account; but a competency of the necessaries of life is usually sought, if it be sought in the proper way, not on its own account, but for the sake of the two higher benefits. Welfare consists in the possession of life itself, and health and soundness of mind and body. The claims of friendship, moreover, are not to be confined within <em>too</em> narrow range, for it embraces all to whom <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and kindly affection are due, although the heart goes out to some of these more freely, to others more cautiously; yea, it even extends to our enemies, for whom also we are commanded to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. There is accordingly no one in the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> to whom kindly affection is not due by reason of the bond of a common humanity, although it may not be due on the ground of reciprocal <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>;</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>For these things, therefore, it becomes us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>: if we have them, that we may keep them; if we have them not, that we may get them.</p>

<p>14. Is this all? Are these the benefits in which exclusively the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life is found? Or does <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> teach us that something else is to be preferred to them all? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that both the competency of things necessary, and the well-being of ourselves and of our friends, so long as these concern this present world alone, are to be cast aside as dross in comparison with the obtaining of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; for although the body may be in health, the mind cannot be regarded as sound which does not prefer <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> to temporal things; yea, the life which we live in time is wasted, if it be not spent in obtaining that by which we may be worthy of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Therefore all things which are the objects of useful and becoming desire are unquestionably to be viewed with reference to that one life which is lived with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is derived from Him. In so doing, we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> ourselves if we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and we <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> our neighbours as ourselves, according to the second great commandment, if, so far as is in our power, we persuade them to a similar <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, for what He is in Himself, and ourselves and our neighbours for His sake. Even when living thus, let us not think that we are securely established in that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, as if there was nothing more for which we should still <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. For how could we be said to live a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life now, while that which alone is the object of a well-directed life is still wanting to us?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>15. Why, then, are our desires scattered over many things, and why, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> as we ought, do we ask what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, and not rather say with the Psalmist: <q>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in His temple</q>?  For in the house of the Lord <q>all the days of life</q> are not days distinguished by their successively coming and passing away: the beginning of one day is not the end of another; but they are all alike unending in that place where the life which is made up of them has itself no end. In order to our obtaining this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> blessed life, He who is Himself the True Blessed Life has taught us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, not with much speaking, as if our being heard depended upon the fluency with which we express ourselves, seeing that we are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> to One who, as the Lord tells us, <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what things we have need of before we ask Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112453"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;6:7-8</a></span> Whence it may seem surprising that, although He has forbidden <q>much speaking,</q> He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> before we ask Him what things we need has nevertheless given us exhortation to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in such words as these: <q>Men ought always to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and not to faint;</q> setting before us the case of a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, who, desiring to have <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> done to her against her adversary, did by her persevering entreaties persuade an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judge to listen to her, not moved by a regard either to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> or to mercy, but overcome by her wearisome importunity; in order that we might be admonished how much more certainly the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, who is merciful and just, gives ear to us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> continually to Him, when this <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, by her unremitting supplication, prevailed over the indifference of an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> judge, and how willingly and benignantly He fulfils the good desires of those whom He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to have forgiven others their trespasses, when this suppliant, though seeking vengeance upon her adversary, obtained her desire. <span class="stiki" id="note112454"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;18:1-8</a></span> A similar lesson the Lord gives in the <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parable</a> of the man to whom a friend in his journey had come, and who, having nothing to set before him, desired to borrow from another friend three loaves (in which, perhaps, there is a figure of the Trinity of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of one substance), and finding him already along with his household asleep, succeeded by very urgent and importunate entreaties in rousing him up, so that he gave him as many as he needed, being moved rather by a wish to avoid further annoyance than by benevolent thoughts: from which the Lord would have us understand that, if even one who was asleep is constrained to give, even in spite of himself, after being disturbed in his sleep by the person who asks of him, how much more kindly will He give who never sleeps, and who rouses us from sleep that we may ask from Him. <span class="stiki" id="note112455"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;11:5-8</a></span> </p>

<p>16. With the same design He added: <q>Ask, and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: for every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If you then, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to them that ask Him?</q>  We have here what corresponds to those three things which the apostle commends: <em><a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em> is signified by the fish, either on account of the element of water used in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or because it remains unharmed amid the tempestuous waves of this world&mdash;contrasted with which is the serpent, that with poisonous deceit persuaded man to disbelieve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <em>hope</em> is signified by the egg, because the life of the young bird is not yet in it, but is to be&mdash; is not seen, but hoped for, because <q>hope which is seen is not hope,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112457"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24</a></span> &mdash; contrasted with which is the scorpion, for the man who hopes for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life forgets the things which are behind, and reaches forth to the things which are before, for to him it is dangerous to look back; but the scorpion is to be guarded against on account of what it has in its tail, namely, a sharp and venomous sting; <em>charity</em>, is signified by bread, for <q>the greatest of these is charity,</q> and bread surpasses all other kinds of food in usefulness&mdash;contrasted with which is a stone, because hard hearts refuse to exercise charity. Whether this be the meaning of these <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbols</a>, or some other more suitable be found, it is at least certain that He who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to give good gifts to His children urges us to <q>ask and seek and knock.</q></p>

<p>17. Why this should be done by Him who <q>before we ask Him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what things we have need of,</q> might perplex our minds, if we did not understand that the Lord our God requires us to ask not that thereby our wish may be intimated to Him, for to Him it cannot be unknown, but in order that by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> there may be exercised in us by supplications that desire by which we may receive what He prepares to bestow. His gifts are very great, but we are small and straitened in our capacity of receiving. Wherefore it is said to us: Be enlarged, not bearing the yoke along with unbelievers. <span class="stiki" id="note112458"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:13-14</a></span> For, in proportion to the simplicity of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the firmness of our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, and the ardour of our desire, will we more largely receive of that which is immensely great; which <q>eye has not seen,</q> for it is not colour; which <q>the ear has not heard,</q> for it is not sound; and which has not ascended into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for the heart of man must ascend to it. <span class="stiki" id="note112459"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>18. When we cherish uninterrupted desire along with the exercise of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope and charity, we <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> always.</q> But at certain stated hours and seasons we also use words in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that by these signs of things we may admonish ourselves, and may acquaint ourselves with the measure of progress which we have made in this desire, and may more warmly excite ourselves to obtain an increase of its strength. For the effect following upon <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> will be excellent in proportion to the fervour of the desire which precedes its utterance. And therefore, what else is intended by the words of the apostle: <q>Pray without ceasing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112460"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> than, <q>Desire without intermission, from Him who alone can give it, a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, which no life can be but that which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a></q>? This, therefore, let us desire continually from the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and thus let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> continually. But at certain hours we recall our minds from other cares and business, in which desire itself somehow is cooled down, to the business of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, admonishing ourselves by the words of our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to fix attention upon that which we desire, lest what had begun to lose heat become altogether cold, and be finally extinguished, if the flame be not more frequently fanned. Whence, also, when the same apostle says, <q>Let your requests be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112461"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;4:6</a></span> this is not to be understood as if thereby they become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them before they were uttered, but in this sense, that they are to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to ourselves in the presence of God by patient waiting upon Him, not in the presence of men by ostentatious worship. Or perhaps that they may be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> also to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> that are in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that these beings may in some way present them to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and consult Him concerning them, and may bring to us, either manifestly or secretly, that which, hearkening to His commandment, they may have learned to be His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, and which must be fulfilled by them according to that which they have there learned to be their duty; for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to Tobias: <span class="stiki" id="note112462"><a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse12">Tobit&nbsp;12:12</a></span> <q>Now, therefore, when you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and Sara your daughter-in-law, I brought the remembrance of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Holy One</a>.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>19. Wherefore it is neither wrong nor unprofitable to spend much time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, if there be leisure for this without hindering other good and necessary works to which duty calls us, although even in the doing of these, as I have said, we ought by cherishing <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> desire to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing. For to spend a long time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is not, as some think, the same thing as to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> <q>with much speaking.</q> Multiplied words are one thing, long-continued warmth of desire is another. For even of the Lord Himself it is written, that He continued all night in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note112463"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;6:12</a></span> and that His <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> was more prolonged when He was in an agony;  and in this is not an example given to us by Him who is in time an Intercessor such as we need, and who is with the Father <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> the Hearer of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>?</p>

<p>20. The brethren in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> are reported to have very frequent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but these very brief, and, as it were, sudden and ejaculatory, lest the wakeful and aroused attention which is indispensable in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should by protracted exercises vanish or lose its keenness. And in this they themselves show plainly enough, that just as this attention is not to be allowed to become exhausted if it cannot continue long, so it is not to be suddenly suspended if it is sustained. Far be it from us either to use <q>much speaking</q> in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, or to refrain from prolonged <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, if fervent attention of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> continue. To use much speaking in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is to employ a superfluity of words in asking a necessary thing; but to prolong <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is to have the heart throbbing with continued <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emotion towards Him to whom we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. For in most cases <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> consists more in groaning than in speaking, in tears rather than in words. But He sets our tears in His sight, and our groaning is not hidden from Him who made all things by the word, and does not need <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> words.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>21. To us, therefore, words are necessary, that by them we may be assisted in considering and observing what we ask, not as means by which we expect that God is to be either informed or moved to compliance. When, therefore, we say: <q>Hallowed be Your name,</q> we admonish ourselves to desire that His name, which is always <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, may be also among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> esteemed <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, that is to say, not despised; which is an advantage not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to men. When we say: <q>Your kingdom come,</q> which shall certainly come whether we wish it or not, we do by these words stir up our own desires for that kingdom, that it may come to us, and that we may be found worthy to reign in it. When we say: <q>Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven,</q> we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for ourselves that He would give us the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, that His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> may be done by us in the same way as it is done in heavenly places by His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. When we say: <q>Give us this day our daily bread,</q> the word <q>this day</q> signifies for the present time, in which we ask either for that competency of temporal  blessings which I have spoken of before (<q>bread</q> being used to designate the whole of those blessings, because of its constituting so important a part of them), or the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, which is in this present time necessary, but necessary in order to obtain the felicity not of the present time, but of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>. When we say: <q>Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors,</q> we remind ourselves both what we should ask, and what we should do in order that we may be worthy to receive what we ask. When we say: <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>,</q> we admonish ourselves to seek that we may not, through being deprived of God's help, be either ensnared to consent or compelled to yield to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. When we say: <q>Deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> we admonish ourselves to consider that we are not yet enjoying that good estate in which we shall experience no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. And this petition, which stands last in the Lord's Prayer, is so comprehensive that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, in whatsoever affliction he be placed, may in using it give utterance to his groans and find vent for his tears&mdash; may begin with this petition, go on with it, and with it conclude his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> For it was necessary that by the use of these words the things which they signify should be kept before our memory.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>22. For whatever other words we may say&mdash;whether the desire of the person <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> go before the words, and employ them in order to give definite form to its requests, or come after them, and concentrate attention upon them, that it may increase in fervour&mdash;if we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> rightly, and as becomes our wants, we say nothing but what is already contained in the Lord's Prayer. And whoever says in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> anything which cannot find its place in that gospel <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> in a way which, if it be not unlawful, is at least not spiritual; and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how carnal <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> can be lawful, since it becomes those who are born again by the Spirit to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in no other way than spiritually. For example, when one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>: <q>Be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among all nations as You are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> among us,</q> and <q>Let Your <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> be found faithful,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112465"><a href="../bible/sir036.htm#verse4">Sirach&nbsp;36:4,&nbsp;18</a></span> what else does he ask than, <q>Hallowed be Your name</q>? When one says: <q>Turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Your face to shine, and we shall be saved,</q>  what else is he saying than, <q>Let Your kingdom come</q>? When one says: <q>Order my steps in Your word, and let not any iniquity have dominion over me,</q>  what else is he saying than, <q>Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven</q>? When one says: <q>Give me neither poverty nor riches,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112468"><a href="../bible/pro030.htm#verse8">Proverbs&nbsp;30:8</a></span> what else is this than, <q>Give us this day our daily bread</q>? When one says: <q>Lord, remember David, and all his compassion,</q>  or, <q>O Lord, if I have done this, if there be iniquity in my hands, if I have rewarded <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to them that did <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to me,</q>  what else is this than, <q>Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors</q>? When one says: <q>Take away from me the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the appetite, and let not sensual desire take hold on me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112471"><a href="../bible/sir023.htm#verse6">Sirach&nbsp;23:6</a></span> what else is this than, <q>Lead us not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a></q>? When one says: <q>Deliver me from mine enemies, O my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; defend me from them that rise up against me,</q>  what else is this than, <q>Deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q>? And if you go over all the words of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, you will, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, find nothing which cannot be comprised and summed up in the petitions of the Lord's Prayer. Wherefore, in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, we are free to use different words to any extent, but we must ask the same things; in this we have no choice.</p>

<p>23. These things it is our duty to ask without hesitation for ourselves and for our friends, and for strangers&mdash; yea, even for enemies; although in the heart of the person <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, desire for one and for another may arise, differing in nature or in strength according to the more immediate or more remote relationship. But he who says in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> such words as, <q>O Lord, multiply my riches;</q> or, <q>Give me as much <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> as You have given to this or that man;</q> or, <q>Increase my honours, make me eminent for power and fame in this world,</q> or something else of this sort, and who asks merely from a desire for these things, and not in order through them to benefit men agreeably to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, I do not think that he will find any part of the Lord's Prayer in connection with which he could fit in these requests. Wherefore let us be ashamed at least to ask these things, if we be not ashamed to desire them. If, however, we are ashamed of even desiring them, but feel ourselves overcome by the desire, how much better would it be to ask to be freed from this plague of desire by Him to whom we say, <q>Deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a></q>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>24. You have now, if I am not mistaken, an answer to two questions&mdash;what kind of person you ought to be if you would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and what things you should ask in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and the answer has been given not by my teaching, but by His who has condescended to teach us all. A <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life is to be sought after, and this is to be asked from the Lord God. Many different answers have been given by many in discussing wherein <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> consists; but why should we go to many teachers, or consider many answers to this question? It has been briefly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> stated in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, <q>Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.</q>  That we may be numbered among this people, and that we may attain to beholding Him and dwelling for ever with Him, <q>the end of the commandment is, charity out of a pure heart, and of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112474"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> In the same three, hope has been placed instead of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Faith, hope, and charity, therefore, lead unto God the man who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a>, <em>i.e.</em> who believes, hopes, and desires, and is guided as to what he should ask from the Lord by studying the Lord's Prayer. Fasting, and abstinence from gratifying carnal desire in other pleasures without injury to health, and especially frequent almsgiving, are a great assistance in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; so that we may be able to say, <q>In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord, with my hands in the night before Him, and I was not deceived.</q>  For how can <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is a Spirit, and who cannot be touched, be sought with hands in any other sense than by good works?</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>25. Perhaps you may still ask why the apostle said, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112476"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;8:26</a></span> for it is wholly incredible that either he or those to whom he wrote were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the Lord's Prayer. He could not say this either rashly or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>; what, then, do we suppose to be his reason for the statement? Is it not that vexations and troubles in this world are for the most part profitable either to heal the swelling of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, or to prove and exercise patience, for which, after such probation and discipline, a greater reward is reserved, or to punish and eradicate some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; but we, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what beneficial purpose these may serve, desire to be freed from all tribulation? To this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> the apostle showed that even he himself was not a stranger (unless, perhaps, he did it notwithstanding his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as he ought), when, lest he should be exalted above measure by the greatness of the revelations, there was given unto him a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> to buffet him; for which thing, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> surely what he ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for, he besought the Lord thrice that it might depart from him. At length he received the answer of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, declaring why that which so great a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for was denied, and why it was expedient that it should not be done: <q>My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you; my strength is made perfect in weakness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112477"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:7-9</a></span> </p>

<p>26. Accordingly, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought in regard to tribulations, which may do us good or harm; and yet, because they are hard and painful, and against the natural feelings of our weak nature, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, with a desire which is common to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, that they may be removed from us. But we ought to exercise such submission to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that if He does not remove those vexations, we do not suppose ourselves to be neglected by Him, but rather, in patient endurance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, hope to be made partakers of greater good, for so His strength is perfected in our weakness. God has sometimes in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> granted the request of impatient petitioners, as in mercy He denied it to the apostle. For we read what the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> asked, and in what manner they asked and obtained their request; but while their desire was granted, their impatience was severely corrected.  Again, He gave them, in answer to their request, a king according to their heart, as it is written, not according to His own heart.  He granted also what the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> asked, namely, that His servant, who was to be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, might be tempted.  He granted also the request of unclean spirits, when they besought Him that their legion might be sent into the great herd of swine. <span class="stiki" id="note112481"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;8:32</a></span> These things are written to prevent any one from thinking too highly of himself if he has received an answer when he was urgently asking anything which it would be more advantageous for him not to receive, or to prevent him from being cast down and despairing of the divine compassion towards himself if he be not heard, when, perchance, he is asking something by the obtaining of which he might be more grievously afflicted, or might be by the corrupting influences of prosperity wholly destroyed. In regard to such things, therefore, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought. Accordingly, if anything is ordered in a way contrary to our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, we ought, patiently bearing the disappointment, and in everything giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to entertain no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> whatever that it was right that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and not our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> should be done. For of this the Mediator has given us an example, inasmuch as, after He had said, <q>Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,</q> transforming the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will which was in Him through His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, He immediately added, <q>Nevertheless, O Father, not as I will but as You will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112482"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;26:39</a></span> Wherefore, not without reason are many made righteous by the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of One. <span class="stiki" id="note112483"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;5:19</a></span> </p>

<p>27. But whoever desires from the Lord that <q>one thing,</q> and seeks after it,  asks in certainty and in confidence, and has no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest when obtained it be injurious to him, seeing that, without it, anything else which he may have obtained by asking in a right way is of no advantage to him. The thing referred to is the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> life, in which, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and incorruptible in body and spirit, we may contemplate the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the Lord for ever. All other things are desired, and are without impropriety <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for, with a view to this one thing. For whosoever has it shall have all that he wishes, and cannot possibly wish to have anything along with it which would be unbecoming. For in it is the fountain of life, which we must now thirst for in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> so long as we live in hope, not yet seeing that which we hope for, trusting under the shadow of His wings before whom are all our desires, that we may be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of His house, and made to drink of the river of His pleasures; because with Him is the fountain of life, and in His light we shall see light,  when our desire shall be satisfied with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, and when there shall be nothing beyond to be sought after with groaning, but all things shall be possessed by us with rejoicing. At the same time, because this blessing is nothing else than the <q>peace which passes all understanding,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112486"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> even when we are asking it in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought. For inasmuch as we cannot present it to our minds as it really is, we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, but whatever image of it may be presented to our minds we reject, disown, and condemn; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it is not what we are seeking, although we do not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> enough to be able to define what we seek.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15</h2>

<p>28. There is therefore in us a certain learned <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, so to speak&mdash; an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> which we learn from that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> who helps our infirmities. For after the apostle said, <q>If we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it,</q> he added in the same passage, <q>Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for as we ought, but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered. And He that searches the hearts <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what is in the mind of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, because He makes intercession for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112487"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;8:25-27</a></span> This is not to be understood as if it meant that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is in the Trinity, God unchangeable, and is one God with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, intercedes for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> like one who is not a divine person; for it is said, <q>He makes intercession for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>,</q> because He enables the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> to make intercession, as in another place it is said, <q>The Lord your God proves you, that He may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether ye <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112488"><a href="../bible/deu012.htm#verse3">Deuteronomy&nbsp;12:3</a></span> <em>i.e.</em> that He may make you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. He therefore makes the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> intercede with groanings which cannot be uttered, when He inspires them with longings for that great blessing, as yet unknown, for which we patiently wait. For how is that which is desired set forth in language if it be unknown, for if it were utterly unknown it would not be desired; and on the other hand, if it were seen, it would not be desired nor sought for with groanings?</p>

<h2>Chapter 16</h2>

<p>29. Considering all these things, and whatever else the Lord shall have made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you in this matter, which either does not occur to me or would take too much time to state here, strive in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to overcome this world: <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in hope, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> earnestly and patiently, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> as a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> belonging to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For although <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is, as He has taught, the duty of all His members, <em>i.e.</em> of all who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him and are united to His body, a more assiduous attention to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is found to be specially enjoined in Scripture upon those who are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>. Two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> of the name of Anna are honourably named there&mdash;the one, Elkanah's wife, who was the mother of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Samuel; the other, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who recognised the Most Holy One when He was yet a babe. The former, though married, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with sorrow of mind and brokenness of heart because she had no sons; and she obtained Samuel, and dedicated him to the Lord, because she vowed to do so when she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for him. <span class="stiki" id="note112489"><a href="../bible/1sa001.htm">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;i</a></span> It is not easy, however, to find to what petition of the Lord's Prayer her petition could be referred, unless it be to the last, <q>Deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> because it was esteemed to be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be married and not to have offspring as the fruit of marriage. Observe, however, what is written concerning the other Anna, the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>: she <q>departed not from the temple, but served God with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> night and day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112490"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;2:36-37</a></span> In like manner, the apostle said in words already quoted, <q>She that is a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> indeed, and desolate, trusts in God and continues in supplications and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> night and day;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112491"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:5</a></span> and the Lord, when exhorting men to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> always and not to faint, made mention of a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, who, by persevering importunity, persuaded a judge to attend to her <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, though he was an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man, and one who neither feared God nor regarded man. How incumbent it is on <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> to go beyond others in devoting time to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> may be plainly enough seen from the fact that from among them are taken the examples set forth as an exhortation to all to earnestness in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>

<p>30. Now what makes this work specially suitable to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> but their bereaved and desolate condition? Whosoever, then, understands that he is in this world bereaved and desolate as long as he is a pilgrim absent from his Lord, is careful to commit his widowhood, so to speak, to his God as his shield in continual and most fervent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Pray, therefore, as a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not yet seeing Him whose help you implore. And though you are very <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> as a poor person, for you have not yet the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> riches of the world to come, in which you have no loss to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. Though you have sons and grandchildren, and a large household, still <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, as I said already, as one who is desolate, for we have no certainty in regard to all temporal blessings that they shall abide for our consolation even to the end of this present life. If you seek and relish the things that are above, you desire things everlasting and sure; and as long as you do not yet possess them, you ought to regard yourself as desolate, even though all your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> are spared to you, and live as you desire. And if you thus act, assuredly your example will be followed by your most devout daughter-in-law,  and the other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> that are settled in peace under your care; for the more <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> the manner in which you order your house, the more are you bound to persevere fervently in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, not engaging yourselves with the affairs of this world further than is demanded in the interests of religion.</p>

<p>31. By all means remember to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> earnestly for me. I would not have you yield such deference to the office fraught with perils which I bear, as to refrain from giving the assistance which I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> myself to need. Prayer was made by the household of Christ for Peter and for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that you are in His household; and I need, incomparably more than Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did, the help of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the brethren. Emulate each other in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> rivalry, with one heart, for you wrestle not against each other, but against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who is the common enemy of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. <q>By <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, by <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>, and all mortification of the body, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is greatly helped.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112493"><a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse8">Tobit&nbsp;12:8</a></span> Let each one do what she can; what one cannot herself do, she does by another who can do it, if she loves in another that which personal inability alone hinders her from doing; wherefore let her who can do less not keep back the one who can do more, and let her who can do more not urge unduly her who can do less.
