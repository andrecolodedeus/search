<h1>Letter 131</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Olympius</em>. </p>

<p>1. Truly unexpected tidings make both ears tingle. This is my case. These compositions against me, which are being carried about, have fallen upon ears by this time pretty well seasoned, on account of my having formerly received the letter, appropriate enough to my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but which I should never have expected to be written by those who sent it. Nevertheless what followed did seem to me so extraordinarily cruel as to blot out all that had gone before. How could I fail to be driven almost out of my senses when I read the letter addressed to the reverend brother Dazinas, full of outrageous insults and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and of attacks against me, as though I had been convicted of much pernicious designs against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Moreover <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> were immediately offered of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against me, from the document of whose authorship I am <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>. Parts I recognise, I own, as having been written by Apollinarius of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>. These I had purposely not even ever read, but I had heard of them from the report of others. Other portions I found included, which I had never either read or heard of from any one else; of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this there is a faithful <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in heaven. How then can men who shun lies, who have learned that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the fulfilling of the law, who profess to bear the burdens of the weak, have consented to bring these <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against me and to condemn me out of other men's writings? I have often asked myself this question, but I cannot <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the reason, unless it be, as I have said from the beginning, that my pain in all this is a part of the punishment which is due to my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>2. First of all I sorrowed in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that truths were lessened by the sons of men; in the second place I feared for my own self, lest in addition to my other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I should become a misanthrope, believing no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to be left in any man; if indeed those whom I have most greatly trusted are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be so disposed both to me and to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Be sure then, my brother, and every one who is a friend of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that the composition is not mine; I do not approve of it, for it is not drawn up according to my views. Even if I did write, a good many years ago, to Apollinarius or to any one else, I ought not to be blamed. I find no fault myself if any member of any society has been cut off into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> perfectly well whom I mean though I mention nobody by name), because each man will die in his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>This is my reply to the document sent me, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and make it plain to all who wish not to hold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in unrighteousness. If it prove necessary to defend myself more at length on each separate count, I will do so, God being my helper. I, brother Olympius, neither maintain three Gods, nor communicate with Apollinarius. </p>
