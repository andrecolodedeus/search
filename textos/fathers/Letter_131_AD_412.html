<h1>Letter 131 (A.D. 412)</h1>

<p> <em>To His Most Excellent Daughter, the Noble and Deservedly Illustrious Lady Proba, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>You speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when you say that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, having its abode in a corruptible body, is restrained by this measure of contact with the earth, and is somehow so bent and crushed by this burden that its desires and thoughts go more easily downwards to many things than upwards to one. For <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> says the same: <q>The corruptible body presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and the earthly tabernacle weighs down the mind that muses upon many things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112495"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> But our Saviour, who by His healing word raised up the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in the gospel that had been eighteen years bowed down <span class="stiki" id="note112496"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;13:11-13</a></span> (whose case was, perchance, a figure of spiritual infirmity), came for this purpose, that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> might not hear in vain the call, <q>Lift up your hearts,</q> and might <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> reply, <q>We lift them up to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> Looking to this, you do well to regard the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of this world as easy to bear because of the hope of the world to come. For thus, by being rightly used, these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> become a blessing, because, while they do not increase our desires for this world, they exercise our patience; as to which the apostle says, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all things work together for good to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112497"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;8:28</a></span> <em>all</em> things, he says&mdash; not only, therefore, those which are desired because pleasant, but also those which are shunned because painful; since we receive the former without being carried away by them, and bear the latter without being crushed by them, and in all give thanks, according to the divine command, to Him of whom we say, <q>I will bless the Lord at all times; His praise shall continually be in my mouth,</q>  and, <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for me that You have humbled me, that I might learn Your statutes.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, most noble lady, that if the calm of this treacherous prosperity were always smiling upon us, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of man would never make for the haven of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and certain safety. Wherefore, in returning the respectful salutation due to your Excellency, and expressing my gratitude for your most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> care for my welfare, I ask of the Lord that He may grant to you the rewards of the life to come, and consolation in the present life; and I commend myself to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all of you in whose hearts Christ dwells by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>(<em>In another hand</em>.) May the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and faithful God <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> comfort your heart and preserve your health, my most excellent daughter and noble lady, deservedly illustrious.</p>
