<h1>Letter 132</h1>

<p> <em>To Ibas, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/05282a.htm">Edessa</a>.</em> </p>

<p>The Lord has taught them that suffer wrong not to be cast down, but to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and to derive consolation from the examples of old. For from the period of the first men down to our own days we find instances of men who have been <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the worship of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, and yet have been wronged by those with whom their lot was cast, and have fallen into many and grievous troubles. Of these I would have gone through the entire list, had I not been writing to one of accurate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. But since you, O beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, have been nurtured from your boyhood in the divine oracles, I have thought it needless so to do. I only ask you to cast your eyes on them, and to look on all the kind-hearted <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> that have done wrong, with sorrow; on all that look lightly on wrong doing, with pity; and to be sorrowful for the disquiet of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. I ask you to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be glad that I am a sharer in suffering for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, and to praise without ceasing Him who has imposed this lot on me. As for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and comfort and the dignity of sees and wretched <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, let us yield them to the murderers. </p>

<p>Let us cleave only to the doctrines of the gospel, and with them, if need be, endure any extremity of pain, and choose <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> penury rather than <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> with its many cares.</p>

<p>I am not writing in these terms in order to give you exhortation, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in trouble. My object is to make my own mind <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and to inform you that you have on your side comrades who are gladly incurring peril for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> sake. I have been anxious for some time to write thus to you, but I have been unable to find anyone to convey my letter. Now I have met with the very <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Ozeas, a man who is at once engaged in the battle for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and attached to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. So I write and salute your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and beg you to give me both the prop of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and the comfort of a letter from you.</p>
