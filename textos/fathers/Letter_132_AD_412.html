<h1>Letter 132 (A.D. 412)</h1>

<p> <em>To Volusianus, My Noble Lord and Most Justly Distinguished Son, Bishop Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>In my desire for your welfare, both in this world and in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I am perhaps not even surpassed by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother. Wherefore, in reciprocating your salutation with the respect due to your worth, I beg to exhort you, as earnestly as I can, not to grudge to devote attention to the study of the Writings which are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and unquestionably <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. For they are genuine and solid <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not winning their way to the mind by artificial eloquence, nor giving forth with flattering voice a vain and uncertain sound. They deeply interest the man who is hungering not for words but for things; and they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> great alarm at first in him whom they are to render safe from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. I exhort you especially to read the writings of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, for from them you will receive a stimulus to acquaint yourself with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, whose testimonies the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> use. If in your reading or meditation on what you have read any question arises to the solution of which I may appear necessary, write to me, that I may write in reply. For, with the Lord helping me, I may perhaps be more able to serve you in this way than by personally conversing with you on such subjects, partly because, through the difference in our occupations, it does not happen that you have leisure at the same times as I might have it, but especially because of the irrepressible intrusion of those who are for the most part not adapted to such discussions, and take more pleasure in a <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of words than in the clear light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; whereas, whatever is written stands always at the service of the reader when he has leisure, and there can be nothing burdensome in the society of that which is taken up or laid aside at your own pleasure.</p>
