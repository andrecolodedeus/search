<h1>Letter 133</h1>

<p> <em>To John, Bishop of Germanicia.</em> </p>

<p>I have always <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, sir, that you are not unmindful of our friendship. And it has ever been my wish and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> should give heed to exact <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and shun the communion of traitors to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, ascribing to the Supreme Ruler His care on our behalf. For indeed, while I have been silent and inactive, He has put an end to our very keen and terrible sufferings, and has replaced the dire tempest by this bright calm. And now that the loving-kindness of the Lord has granted us this blessing, I find the quiet of my retreat indeed delightful, for I feel the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of persuading those who have been led away by the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> launched against me, and of both convincing them of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, and refuting the attack of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. When once this refutation is finished, and the victory of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is secured, it is my purpose to quit public life, and withdraw to the rest that I so greatly long for. As to the foes of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> I cry with the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>Their memorial is perished with a noise, but the Lord shall endure for ever.</q>  As to ourselves, I sing with the Psalmist, <q>He sent from above, He took me, He drew me out of many waters, He delivered me from my strong enemy.</q> </p>

<p>This letter is in reply to two received from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, one conveyed by Anastasius, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Ber&oelig;a, and one by the standard-bearer Theodotus. In your last letter you mention another, but this has not been delivered. As to my journey there I can say nothing till I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what orders are given concerning me by the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor. His letter has not yet arrived.</p>
