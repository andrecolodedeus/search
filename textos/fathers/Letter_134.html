<h1>Letter 134</h1>

<p> <em>To Theoctistus, Bishop of Ber&oelig;a.</em> </p>

<p>Our Saviour, Lawgiver, and Lord, was once asked, <q>What is the first commandment?</q> His reply was <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your mind.</q> And He added <q>This is the first commandment: and the second is like it, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself.</q> Then He said further <q>On these two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> </p>

<p>He then who keeps these, according to the definition of the Lord, plainly fulfils the Law; and he who transgresses them is guilty of transgressing the whole Law. Let us then examine, before the exact and righteous tribunal of our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, whether we have fulfilled the divine commandments. Now the first is kept by him who guards the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in its integrity, who abominates its assailants as enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> heartily all those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the beloved; and the second by him who most highly esteems the care of his neighbour and who, not only in prosperity but also in apparent misfortunes, observes the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of friendship. They, on the other hand, who look after their own safety, as they suppose, who on its account make little of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of friendship and take no heed of their friends when assaulted and attacked, are reckoned to belong to the number of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and of them that are without. The Lord of all requires better things at the hands of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. <q>Love</q> He says <q>your enemies, for if you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> them which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, what reward will you have? For the sinners and the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> do this.</q>  I, however, have not received even such kindness as <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> receive. Publicans, do I say? I have not even received the consolation given to murderers and wizards in their dungeons. If every one had imitated this cruelty, nothing else would have been left then for me in my life time but to be wasted by want, and, at my death, instead of being committed to a tomb, to be made meat  for dogs and wild beasts. But I have found support in those who care nought for this present life, but await the enjoyment of everlasting blessings, and these furnish me with manifold consolation. But the loving Lord <q>caused judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared and was still, when God arose to judgment.</q>  But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall perish.  The <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has been proscribed, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> is publicly proclaimed. I for my part exclaim with the blessed David, <q>Blessed be the Lord God who only does wondrous things, and blessed be His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> name: and let the whole earth be filled with His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a> and <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">amen</a>.</q> </p>
