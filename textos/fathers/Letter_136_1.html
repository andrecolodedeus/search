<h1>Letter 136</h1>

<p><strong>From Pope Innocent to Jerome</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Innocent expresses his sympathy with Jerome and promises to take strong measures to punish his opponents if he will bring specific charges against them. The date of the letter is A.D. 417.</span> </p>

<p">Innocent to his most esteemed son, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Jerome.</p>

<p>The apostle <span class="stiki" id="note303885"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus&nbsp;3:10-11</a></span> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that contention has never done good in the church; and for this reason he gives direction that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be admonished once or twice in the beginning of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and not subjected to a long series of rebukes. Where this rule is negligently observed, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to be guarded against so far from being evaded is rather intensified.</p>

<p>Your grief and lamentation have so affected us that we can neither act nor advise.</p>

<p>To begin however, we commend you for the constancy of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. To quote your own words spoken many times in the ears of many, a man will gladly face misrepresentation or even personal danger on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; if he is looking for the blessedness that is to come. We remind you of what you have yourself preached although we are sure that you need no reminder. The spectacle of these terrible <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> has so thoroughly roused us that we have hastened to put forth the authority of the apostolic see to repress the plague in all its manifestations; but as your letters name no individuals and bring no specific charges, there is no one at present against whom we can proceed. But we do all that we can; we sympathize deeply with you. And if you will lay a clear and unambiguous accusation against any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in particular we will appoint suitable judges to try their cases; or if you, our highly esteemed son, think that it is needful for us to take yet graver and more urgent action, we shall not be slow to do so. Meantime we have written to our brother <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> John  advising him to act more considerately, so that nothing may occur in the church committed to him which it is his duty to foresee and to prevent, and that nothing may happen which may subsequently prove a source of trouble to him.</p>
