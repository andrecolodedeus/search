<h1>Letter 136 (A.D. 412)</h1>

<p> <em>To Augustine, My Lord Most Venerable, and Father Singularly Worthy of All Possible Service from Me, I, Marcellinus Send Greeting.</em></p>

<p>1. The noble Volusianus read to me the letter of your Holiness, and, at my urgent solicitation, he read to many more the sentences which had won my admiration, for, like everything else coming from your pen, they were worthy of admiration. Breathing as it did a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> spirit, and rich in the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of divine eloquence, it succeeded easily in pleasing the reader. What especially pleased me was your strenuous effort to establish and hold up the steps of one who is somewhat hesitating, by counselling him to form a good resolution. For I have every day some discussion with the same man, so far as my abilities, or rather my lack of talent, may enable me. Moved by the earnest entreaties of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother, I am at pains to visit him frequently, and he is so good as to return my visits from time to time. But on receiving this letter from your venerable Eminence, though he is kept back from firm <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God by the influence of a class of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who abound in this city, he was so moved, that, as he himself tells me, he was prevented only by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of undue prolixity in his letter from unfolding to you every possible difficulty in regard to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Some things, however, he has very earnestly asked you to explain, expressing himself in a polished and accurate style, and with the perspicuity and brilliancy of Roman eloquence, such as you will yourself deem worthy of approbation. The question which he has submitted to you is indeed worn threadbare in controversy, and the craftiness which, from the same quarter, assails with reproaches the Lord's <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> is well known. But as I am confident that whatever you write in reply will be of use to a very large number, I would approach you with the request, that even in this question you would condescend to give a thoroughly guarded answer to their false statement that in His works the Lord performed nothing beyond what other men have been able to do. They are accustomed to bring forward their Apollonius and Apuleius, and other men who professed magical arts, whose <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> they maintained to have been greater than the Lord's.</p>

<p>2. The noble Volusianus aforesaid declared also in the presence of a number, that there were many other things which might not unreasonably be added to the question which he has sent, were it not that, as I have already stated, brevity had been specially studied by him in his letter. Although, however, he forbore from writing them, he did not pass them over in silence. For he is wont to say that, even if a reasonable account of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> were now given to him, it would still be very difficult to give a satisfactory reason why this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is affirmed to be the God also of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, is pleased with new <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> after having rejected the ancient <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. For he alleges that nothing could be corrected but that which is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been previously not rightly done; or that what has once been done rightly ought not to be altered in the very least. That which has been rightly done, he said, cannot be changed without wrong, especially because the variation might bring upon the Deity the reproach of inconstancy. Another objection which he stated was, that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine and preaching were in no way consistent with the duties and rights of citizens; because, to quote an instance frequently alleged, among its precepts we find, <q>Recompense to no man <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112512"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;12:17</a></span> and, <q>Whosoever shall smite you on one cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any man take away your coat, let him have your cloak also; and whosoever shall compel you to go a mile, go with him two;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112513"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39-41</a></span> &mdash; all which he affirms to be contrary to the duties and rights of citizens. For who would submit to have anything taken from him by an enemy, or forbear from retaliating the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon an invader who ravaged a Roman province? The other precepts, as your Eminence understands, are open to similar objections. Volusianus thinks that all these difficulties may be added to the question formerly stated, especially because it is manifest (though he is silent on this point) that very great calamities have befallen the commonwealth under the government of emperors observing, for the most part, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>. </p>

<p>3. Wherefore, as your Grace condescends along with me to acknowledge, it is important that all these difficulties be met by a full, thorough, and luminous reply (since the welcome answer of your Holiness will doubtless be put into many hands); especially because, while this discussion was going on, a distinguished lord and proprietor in the region of Hippo was present, who ironically said some flattering things concerning your Holiness, and affirmed that he had been by no means satisfied when he inquired into these matters himself.</p>

<p>I, therefore, not unmindful of your promise, but insisting on its fulfilment, beseech you to write, on the questions submitted, treatises which will be of incredible service to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, especially at the present time.</p>
