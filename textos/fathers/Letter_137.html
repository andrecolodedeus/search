<h1>Letter 137</h1>

<p> <em>To the Archimandrite John.</em> </p>

<p>The blessed David fell into several <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who wisely orders all things, has caused to be recorded for the good of them that were to come after. But it was not on their account that Absalom, parricide, murderer, impious, and altogether vile, started his wild <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against his father. The reason of his beginning that most unrighteous struggle was because he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> the sovereignty. The divine David, however, when these events were coming to pass, began to remember the wrong that he had done. I too am conscious within myself of the guilt of many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, but I have kept undefiled the dogmatic teaching of the Apostles. And they who have trampled upon all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and divine, and condemned me in my absence, have not sentenced me for what I have done wrong, for my secret <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are not made manifest to them; but they have contrived false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> and <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> against me, or rather in their open attack upon the doctrines of the Apostles have proscribed me for my <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to them. <q>So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep; He smote His enemies in the hinderparts and put them to a perpetual shame.</q>  Counterfeit and spurious doctrines He has scattered to the winds, and has provided for the free preaching of those which He has handed down to us in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. To me this suffices for complete delight. I do not even long for a city in which I have passed all my time in hard work; all I long for is to see the establishment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>. And now the Lord has satisfied this longing. I am therefore very glad and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, and I sing praises to our generous Lord, and I invite your reverence to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with me, and, with our praises, to put up the earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> that the men who say now one thing and now another and change about to suit the hour, like the chameleons who assume the colour of the leaves, may be strengthened by the loving-kindness of the Lord, established upon the rocks and, of His mercy, made to pay the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>
