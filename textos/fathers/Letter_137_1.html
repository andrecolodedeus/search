<h1>Letter 137</h1>

<p><strong>From Pope Innocent to John, Bishop of Jerusalem</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Innocent censures John for having allowed the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> to effuse the disturbance at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> mentioned in the two preceding letters and exhorts him to be more watchful over his diocese in future. The date of the letter is A.D. 417. This was the year of the death of both John and Innocent, and it is probable that John never received the letter.</span> </p>

<p>Innocent to his most highly esteemed brother John.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> and <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>  have deplored to me the ravages, murders, fires and outrages of all kinds, which they say that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has perpetrated in the district belonging to their church; for with wonderful clemency and generosity they have left untold the name and motive of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> agent. Now although there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to who is the guilty person;  yet you, my brother, ought to have taken precautions and to have been more careful of your flock so that no disturbance of the kind might arise; for others suffer by your negligence, and you encourage men by it to make havoc of the Lord's flock till His tender lambs, fleeced and weakened by fire, sword and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, their relations murdered and dead, are, as we are informed, themselves scarce alive. Does it not touch your sacred responsibility as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has shown himself so powerful against you and yours? Against you, I say; for surely it speaks ill of your capacity as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> that a crime so terrible should have been committed in the pale of your church. Where were your precautions? Where, after the blow had been struck, were your attempts at relief? Where too were your words of comfort? These ladies tell me that up to the present they have been in a state of too great apprehension to complain of what they have already suffered. I should judge more gravely of the matter had they spoken to me concerning it more freely than they have. Beware then, brother, of the wiles of the old enemy, and in the spirit of a good ruler be vigilant either to correct or to repress such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For they have reached my ears in the shape of rumours rather than as specific accusations. If nothing is done, the law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on the subject of injuries may compel the person who has failed to defend his flock to show <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for his negligence.</p>
