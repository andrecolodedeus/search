<h1>Letter 138</h1>

<p> <em>To Anatolius the Patrician.</em> </p>

<p>I have cordially welcomed the rest which has fallen to my lot, and am harvesting its beneficial and pleasant results. Our Christ-loving Emperor,  after reaping the empire as fruit of his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, has offered as <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of his sovereignty to Him that bestowed it, the calm of the storm-tossed churches, the triumph of the invaded <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the victory of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. To these he has added the righting of the wrong done to me. Of a wrong so great and of such a kind who ever heard? What murderer was ever doomed in his absence? What violator of wedlock was ever condemned without a hearing? What burglar, grave-breaker, wizard, church-robber, or doer of any other unlawful deed, was ever prevented, when eager to appeal to the law, and slain when far away by the sentence of his judge? In their cases nothing of the kind was ever <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. For, by our law, plaintiff and defendant are bidden to stand face to face before the judge, while the judge has to wait for the production of plain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and then and not till then, either dismiss the accused as innocent, or punish him as being reached by the indictment. In my case the course pursued has been just the opposite. The emperor's letter forbade me to approach the far-famed synod, and the most righteous judges condemned me in my absence, not after fair trial, but after extravagant laudation of the documents which were produced to incriminate me. Neither the law of God nor shame of man staved the deed of blood. Orders were given by the president,  flinging the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to the winds, and courting the power of the hour. He was <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> by men who think as I do, whose doctrines are my doctrines, and who had expressed admiration of me and mine. None the less did that day convict some men of treachery; some of cowardice; while to me a ground of confidence was given by my sufferings for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> sake. And to me our master Christ has granted the boon <q>not only of believing on Him but also of suffering for His sake.</q>  For the greatest of all gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are sufferings for the Master's sake, and the divine Apostle puts them even before great marvels.</p>

<p>In these boons I too <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and insignificant as I am, and having no other ground of boasting. And I beseech your excellency to offer on behalf of my poor self expressions of thanksgiving to the emperor, lover of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> Augusta,  dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, instructress of the good, for that she has requited our generous Lord with such gifts, and has made her <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion the foundation and groundwork of her sway. Besides this, beg their godly majesties to complete the work that has been so well marked out, and to summon a council, not, like the last, composed of a turbulent rabble, but&mdash; kept quite clear of all of these&mdash; of men who decide on and highly value divine things, and esteem all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs as of less account than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If their majesties wish to bring about the ancient peace for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and I am sure that they do, beg their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> graces to take part in the proceedings, that their presence may overawe those of a contrary mind and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may have none to gainsay her, but may herself by her own unaided powers examine into the position of affairs, and the character of the apostolic doctrines.</p>

<p>I make this request to your excellency, not because I long to see Cyrus again, for your lordship <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> what a solitary town it is, and how I have somehow or other managed to conceal its ugliness by my great expenditure on all kinds of buildings, but to the end that what I preach may be shown to be in agreement with apostolic doctrines while the inventions of my opponents are counterfeit and base. Once let this come to pass, by God's help be it spoken, and I shall pass the remainder of my days in cheerful contentment, wherever the Master may bid me dwell. To you who have been brought up in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, and are dowered with the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of goodness it is becoming to make this effort, and by your urgent counsel to render yet more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor and the Christ-loving Augusta, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> already as they are to strengthen their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> empire by laudable and rightful energy.</p>
