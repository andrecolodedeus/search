<h1>Letter 138 (A.D. 412)</h1>

<p> <em>To Marcellinus, My Noble and Justly Famous Lord, My Son Most Beloved and Longed For, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. In writing to the illustrious and most eloquent Volusianus, whom we both sincerely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, I thought it right to confine myself to answering the questions which he thought proper himself to state; but as to the questions which you have submitted to me in your letter for discussion and solution, as suggested or proposed either by Volusianus himself or by others, it is fitting that such reply to these as I may be able to give should be addressed to you. I shall attempt this, not in the manner in which it would require to be done in a formal treatise, but in the manner which is suitable to the conversational familiarity of a letter, in order that, if you, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> their state of mind by daily discussions, think it expedient, this letter also may be read to your friends. But if this communication be not adapted to them, because of their not being prepared by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to give ear to it, let what you consider adapted to them be in the first place prepared between ourselves, and afterwards let what may have been thus prepared be communicated to them. For there are many things from which their minds may in the meantime shrink and recoil, which they may perhaps by and by be persuaded to accept as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, either by the use of more copious and skilful arguments, or by an appeal to authority which, in their opinion, may not without impropriety be resisted.</p>

<p>2. In your letter you state that some are perplexed by the question, <q>Why this <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be the God also of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, is pleased with new <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> after having rejected the ancient ones. For they allege that nothing can be corrected but that which is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been previously not rightly done, or that what has once been done rightly ought not to be altered in the very least: that which has been rightly done, they say, cannot be changed without wrong.</q>  I quote these words from your letter. Were I disposed to give a copious reply to this objection, time would fail me long before I had exhausted the instances in which the processes of nature itself and the works of men undergo changes according to the circumstances of the time, while, at the same time, there is nothing mutable in the plan or principle by which these changes are regulated. Of these I may mention a few, that, stimulated by them, your wakeful observation may run, as it were, from them to many more of the same kind. Does not summer follow winter, the temperature gradually increasing in warmth? Do not night and day in turn succeed each other? How often do our own lives experience changes! Boyhood departing, never to return, gives place to youth; manhood, destined itself to continue only for a season, takes in turn the place of youth; and old age, closing the term of manhood, is itself closed by death.  All these things are changed, but the plan of <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> which appoints these successive changes is not changed. I suppose, also, that the principles of agriculture are not changed when the farmer appoints a different work to be done in summer from that which he had ordered in winter. He who rises in the morning, after resting by night, is not supposed to have changed the plan of his life. The schoolmaster gives to the adult different tasks from those which he was accustomed to prescribe to the scholar in his boyhoo; his teaching, consistent throughout, changes the instruction when the lesson is changed, without itself being changed.</p>

<p>3. The eminent physician of our own times, Vindicianus, being consulted by an invalid, prescribed for his disease what seemed to him a suitable remedy at that time; health was restored by its use. Some years afterwards, finding himself troubled again with the same disorder, the patient supposed that the same remedy should be applied; but its application made his illness worse. In astonishment, he again returns to the physician, and tells him what had happened; whereupon he, being a man of very quick penetration, answered: <q>The reason of your having been harmed by this application is, that I did not order it;</q> upon which all who heard the remark and did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the man supposed that he was trusting not in the art of medicine, but in some forbidden supernatural power. When he was afterwards questioned by some who were amazed at his words, he explained what they had not understood, namely, that he would not have prescribed the same remedy to the patient at the age which he had now attained. While, therefore, the principle and methods of art remain unchanged, the change which, in accordance with them, may be made necessary by the difference of times is very great.</p>

<p>4. To say then, that what has once been done rightly must in no respect whatever be changed, is to affirm what is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For if the circumstances of time which occasioned anything be changed, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason in almost all cases demands that what had been in the former circumstances rightly done, be now so altered that, although they say that it is not rightly done if it be changed, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, on the contrary, protests that it is not rightly done unless it be changed; because, at both times, it will be rightly done if the difference be regulated according to the difference in the times. For just as in the cases of different <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> it may happen that, at the same moment, one man may do with impunity what another man may not, because of a difference not in the thing done but in the person who does it, so in the case of one and the same person at different times, that which was duty formerly is not duty now, not because the person is different from his former self, but because the time at which he does it is different.</p>

<p>5. The wide range opened up by this question may be seen by any one who is competent and careful to observe the contrast between the beautiful and the suitable, examples of which are scattered, we may say, throughout the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. For the beautiful, to which the ugly and deformed is opposed, is estimated and praised according to what it is in itself. But the suitable, to which the incongruous is opposed, depends on something else to which it is bound, and is estimated not according to what it is in itself, but according to that with which it is connected: the contrast, also, between becoming and unbecoming is either the same, or at least regarded as the same. Now apply what we have said to the subject in hand. The divine institution of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was suitable in the former dispensation, but is not suitable now. For the change suitable to the present age has been enjoined by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> infinitely better than man what is fitting for every age, and who is, whether He give or add, abolish or curtail, increase or diminish, the unchangeable Governor as He is the unchangeable Creator of mutable things, ordering all events in His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> until the beauty of the completed course of time, the component parts of which are the dispensations adapted to each successive age, shall be finished, like the grand melody of some ineffably wise master of song, and those pass into the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> immediate <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of God who here, though it is a time of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not of sight, are acceptably worshipping Him.</p>

<p>6. They are mistaken, moreover, who think that God appoints these ordinances for His own advantage or pleasure; and no wonder that, being thus mistaken, they are perplexed, as if it was from a changing mood that He ordered one thing to be offered to Him in a former age, and something else now. But this is not the case. God enjoins nothing for His own advantage, but for the benefit of those to whom the injunction is given. Therefore He is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Lord, for He does not need His servants, but His servants stand in need of Him. In those same <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> Scriptures, and in the age in which <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> were still being offered that are now abrogated, it is said: <q>I said unto the Lord, You are my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for You do not need my <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things.</q>  Wherefore God did not stand in need of those <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, nor does He ever need anything; but there are certain acts, <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> of these divine gifts, whereby the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> receives either present <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, in the celebration and practice of which, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exercises, serviceable not to God but to ourselves, are performed.</p> 

<p>7. It would, however, take too long to discuss with adequate fullness the differences between the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> actions of former and present times, which, because of their pertaining to divine things, are called <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.  For as the man is not fickle who does one thing in the morning and another in the evening, one thing this month and another in the next, one thing this year and another next year, so there is no variableness with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, though in the former period of the world's history He enjoined one kind of offerings, and in the latter period another, therein ordering the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbolic</a> actions pertaining to the blessed doctrine of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion in harmony with the changes of successive epochs without any change in Himself. For in order to let those whom these things perplex understand that the change was already in the divine counsel, and that, when the new ordinances were appointed, it was not because the old had suddenly lost the divine approbation through inconstancy in His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, but that this had been already fixed and determined by the wisdom of that God to whom, in reference to much greater changes, these words are spoken in Scripture: You shall change them, and they shall be changed; but You are the same, &mdash; it is necessary to convince them that this exchange of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> for those of the New had been predicted by the voices of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. For thus they will see, if they can see anything, that what is new in time is not new in relation to Him who has appointed the times, and who possesses, without succession of time, all those things which He assigns according to their variety to the several ages. For in the psalm from which I have quoted above the words: <q>I said unto the Lord, You are my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for You do not need my <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things,</q> in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that God does not need our <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, it is added shortly after by the Psalmist in Christ's name: <q>I will not gather their assemblies of blood;</q>  that is, for the offering of animals from their flocks, for which the Jewish assemblies were wont to be gathered together; and in another place he says: <q>I will take no bullock out of your house, nor he-goat from your folds;</q>  and another <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says: <q>Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and with the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">house of Judah</a>: not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112543"><a href="../bible/jer031.htm#verse32">Jeremiah&nbsp;31:32</a></span> There are, besides these, many other testimonies on this subject in which it was foretold that God would do as He has done; but it would take too long to mention them.</p>

<p>8. If it is now established that that which was for one age rightly ordained may be in another age rightly changed&mdash;the alteration indicating a change in the work, not in the plan, of Him who makes the change, the plan being framed by His reasoning faculty, to which, unconditioned by succession in time, those things are simultaneously present which cannot be actually done at the same time because the ages succeed each other&mdash;one might perhaps at this point expect to hear from me the causes of the change in question. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how long it would take to discuss these fully. The matter may be stated summarily, but sufficiently for a man of shrewd judgment, in these words: It was fitting that Christ's future coming should be foretold by some <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and that after His coming other <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> should proclaim this; just as the difference in the facts has compelled us to change the words used by us in speaking of the advent as future or past: to be foretold is one thing, to be proclaimed is another, and to be about to come is one thing, to have come is another.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>9. Let us now observe in the second place, what follows in your letter.  You have added that they said that the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine and preaching were in no way consistent with the duties and rights of citizens, because among its precepts we find: <q>Recompense to no man <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112545"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;12:17</a></span> and, <q>Whosoever shall smite you on one cheek, turn to him the other also; and if any man take away your coat, let him have your cloak also; and whosoever will compel you to go a mile with him, go with him two,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112546"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39-41</a></span> &mdash; all which are affirmed to be contrary to the duties and rights of citizens; for who would submit to have anything taken from him by an enemy, or forbear from retaliating the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> upon an invader who ravaged a Roman province? To these and similar statements of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> speaking slightingly, or perhaps I should rather say speaking as inquirers regarding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I might have given a more elaborate answer, were it not that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with whom the discussion is carried on are men of liberal education. In addressing such, why should we prolong the debate, and not rather begin by inquiring for ourselves how it was possible that the Republic of Rome was governed and aggrandized from insignificance and poverty to greatness and opulence by men who, when they had suffered wrong, would rather pardon than punish the offender;  or how Cicero, addressing C&aelig;sar, the greatest statesman of his time, said, in praising his character, that he was wont to forget nothing but the wrongs which were done to him?  For in this Cicero spoke either praise or flattery: if he spoke praise, it was because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> C&aelig;sar to be such as he affirmed; if he spoke flattery, he showed that the chief magistrate of a commonwealth ought to do such things as he <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> commended in C&aelig;sar. But what is <q>not rendering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> but refraining from the passion of revenge&mdash; in other words, choosing, when one has suffered wrong, to pardon rather than to punish the offender, and to forget nothing but the wrongs done to us?</p>

<p>10. When these things are read in their own authors, they are received with loud applause; they are regarded as the record and recommendation of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in the practice of which the Republic deserved to hold sway over so many nations, because its citizens preferred to pardon rather than punish those who wronged them. But when the precept, <q>Render to no man <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> is read as given by divine authority, and when, from the pulpits in our churches, this wholesome counsel is published in the midst of our congregations, or, as we might say, in places of instruction open to all, of both sexes and of all ages and ranks, our religion is accused as an enemy to the Republic! Yet, were our religion listened to as it deserves, it would establish, consecrate, strengthen, and enlarge the commonwealth in a way beyond all that Romulus, Numa, Brutus, and all the other men of renown in Roman history achieved. For what is a republic but a commonwealth? Therefore its interests are common to all; they are the interests of the State. Now what is a State but a multitude of men bound together by some bond of concord? In one of their own authors we read: <q>What was a scattered and unsettled multitude had by concord become in a short time a State.</q> But what exhortations to concord have they ever appointed to be read in their temples? So far from this, they were unhappily compelled to devise how they might worship without giving offense to any of their gods, who were all at such variance among themselves, that, had their worshippers imitated their quarrelling, the State must have fallen to pieces for want of the bond of concord, as it soon afterwards began to do through civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, when the morals of the people were changed and corrupted.</p>

<p>11. But who, even though he be a stranger to our religion, is so deaf as not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how many precepts enjoining concord, not invented by the discussions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but written with the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are continually read in the churches of Christ? For this is the tendency even of those precepts which they are much more willing to debate than to follow: <q>That to him who smites us on one cheek we should offer the other to be smitten; to him who would take away our coat we should give our cloak also; and that with him who compels us to go one mile we should go two.</q> For these things are done only that a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man may be overcome by kindness, or rather that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man may be overcome by good, and that the man may be delivered from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>&mdash; not from any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that is external and foreign to himself, but from that which is within and is his own, under which he suffers loss more severe and fatal than could be inflicted by the cruelty of any enemy from without. He, therefore, who is overcoming <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> by good, submits patiently to the loss of temporal advantages, that he may show how those things, through excessive <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of which the other is made <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, deserve to be despised when compared with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and righteousness; in order that so the injurious person may learn from him whom he wronged what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of the things for the sake of which he committed the wrong, and may be won back with sorrow for his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to that concord, than which nothing is more serviceable to the State, being overcome not by the strength of one passionately resenting, but by the good-nature of one patiently bearing wrong. For then it is rightly done when it seems that it will benefit him for whose sake it is done, by producing in him amendment of his ways and concord with others. At all events, it is to be done with this intention, even though the result may be different from what was expected, and the man, with a view to whose correction and conciliation this healing and salutary medicine, so to speak, was employed, refuses to be corrected and reconciled.</p>

<p>12. Moreover, if we pay attention to the words of the precept, and consider ourselves under bondage to the literal interpretation, the right cheek is not to be presented by us if the left has been smitten. <q>Whosoever,</q> it is said, <q>shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112549"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39</a></span> but the left cheek is more liable to be smitten, because it is easier for the right hand of the assailant to smite it than the other. But the words are commonly understood as if our Lord had said: If any one has acted injuriously to you in respect of the higher possessions which you have, offer to him also the inferior possessions, lest, being more concerned about revenge than about forbearance, you should despise <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things in comparison with temporal things, whereas temporal things ought to be despised in comparison with <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> things, as the left is in comparison with the right. This has been always the aim of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; for final vengeance is righteously demanded only when there remains no room for amendment, namely, in the last great judgment. But meanwhile we must be on our guard, lest, through desire for revenge, we lose patience itself&mdash;a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is of more value than all which an enemy can, in spite of our resistance, take away from us. For another <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a>, in recording the same precept, makes no mention of the right cheek, but names merely the one and the other; <span class="stiki" id="note112550"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;6:29</a></span> so that, while the duty may be somewhat more distinctly learned from Matthew's gospel, he simply commends the same exercise of patience. Wherefore a righteous and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> man ought to be prepared to endure with patience injury from those whom he desires to make good, so that the number of good men may be increased, instead of himself being added, by retaliation of injury, to the number of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men.</p>

<p>13. In fine, that these precepts pertain rather to the inward disposition of the heart than to the actions which are done in the sight of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, requiring us, in the inmost heart, to cherish patience along with benevolence, but in the outward action to do that which seems most likely to benefit those whose good we ought to seek, is manifest from the fact that our Lord Jesus Himself, our perfect example of patience, when He was smitten on the face, answered: <q>If I have spoken <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but if not, why do you smite me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112551"><a href="../bible/joh018.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;18:23</a></span> If we look only to the words, He did not in this <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> His own precept, for He did not present the other side of his face to him who had smitten Him but, on the contrary, prevented him who had done the wrong from adding thereto; and yet He had come prepared not only to be smitten on the face, but even to be slain upon the cross for those at whose hands He suffered crucifixion, and for whom, when hanging on the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, <q>Father, forgive them, they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what they do!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112552"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse34">Luke&nbsp;23:34</a></span> In like manner, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> seems to have failed to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the precept of his Lord and Master, when he, being smitten on the face as He had been, said to the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall smite you, you whited wall, for do you sit to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?</q> And when it was said by them that stood near, <q>Do you revile God's <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>?</q> he took pains sarcastically to indicate what his words meant, that those of them who were discerning might understand that now the whited wall, <em>i.e.</em> the hypocrisy of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, was appointed to be thrown down by the coming of Christ; for He said: <q>I knew not, brethren, that he was the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, for it is written, You shall not speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the ruler of your people;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112553"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;23:3-5</a></span> although it is perfectly certain that he who had grown up in that nation and had been in that place trained in the law, could not but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that his judge was the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and could not, by professing <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> on this point, impose upon those to whom he was so well known.</p>

<p>14. These precepts concerning patience ought to be always retained in the habitual discipline of the heart, and the benevolence which prevents the recompensing of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> must be always fully cherished in the disposition. At the same time, many things must be done in correcting with a certain benevolent severity, even against their own wishes, men whose welfare rather than their wishes it is our duty to consult and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Scriptures have most unambiguously commended this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in a magistrate. For in the correction of a son, even with some sternness, there is assuredly no diminution of a father's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; yet, in the correction, that is done which is received with reluctance and pain by one whom it seems necessary to heal by pain. And on this principle, if the commonwealth observe the precepts of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, even its <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> themselves will not be carried on without the benevolent design that, after the resisting nations have been conquered, provision may be more easily made for enjoying in peace the mutual bond of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. For the person from whom is taken away the freedom which he abuses in doing wrong is vanquished with benefit to himself; since nothing is more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a misfortune than that good fortune of offenders, by which pernicious impunity is maintained, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition, like an enemy within the man, is strengthened. But the perverse and froward hearts of men think <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are prosperous when men are concerned about magnificent mansions, and indifferent to the ruin of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>; when mighty theatres are built up, and the foundations of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> are undermined; when the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of extravagance is highly esteemed, and works of mercy are scorned; when, out of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and affluence of rich men, luxurious provision is made for actors, and the poor are grudged the necessaries of life; when that God who, by the public declarations of His doctrine, protests against public <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> by impious communities, which demand gods of such character that even those theatrical representations which bring disgrace to both body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are fitly performed in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of them. If God permit these things to prevail, He is in that permission showing more grievous displeasure: if He leave these crimes unpunished, such impunity is a more terrible judgment. When, on the other hand, He overthrows the props of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and reduces to poverty those <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> which were nursed by plenty, He afflicts in mercy. And in mercy, also, if such a thing were possible, even <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> might be waged by the good, in order that, by bringing under the yoke the unbridled <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, those <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> might be abolished which ought, under a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> government, to be either extirpated or suppressed.</p>

<p>15. For if the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> condemned <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> of every kind, the command given in the gospel to soldiers asking counsel as to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> would rather be to cast away their arms, and withdraw themselves wholly from military service; whereas the word spoken to such was, <q>Do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to no man, neither accuse any <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, and be content with your wages,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112554"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;3:14</a></span> &mdash; the command to be content with their wages manifestly implying no prohibition to continue in the service. Wherefore, let those who say that the doctrine of Christ is incompatible with the State's well-being, give us an army composed of soldiers such as the doctrine of Christ requires them to be; let them give us such subjects, such husbands and wives, such <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and children, such masters and servants, such kings, such judges&mdash; in fine, even such taxpayers and tax-gatherers, as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> has taught that men should be, and then let them dare to say that it is adverse to the State's well-being; yea, rather, let them no longer hesitate to confess that this doctrine, if it were <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, would be the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the commonwealth.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>16. But what am I to answer to the assertion made that many calamities have befallen the Roman Empire through some <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors? This sweeping accusation is a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>. For if they would more clearly quote some indisputable facts in support of it from the history of past emperors, I also could mention similar, perhaps even greater calamities in the reigns of other emperors who were not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; so that men may understand that these were either faults in the men, not in their religion, or were due not to the emperors themselves, but to others without whom emperors can do nothing. As to the date of the commencement of the downfall of the Roman Republic, there is ample evidence; their own literature speaks plainly as to this. Long before the name of Christ had shone abroad on the earth, this was said of Rome: <q>O venal city, and doomed to perish speedily, if only it could find a purchaser!</q>  In his book on the Catilinarian conspiracy, which was before the coming of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the same most illustrious Roman historian declares plainly the time when the army of the Roman people began to be wanton and drunken; to set a high value on <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, paintings, and embossed vases; to take these by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> both from individuals and from the State; to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">rob</a> temples and pollute everything, sacred and profane. When, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a> and grasping <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the corrupt and abandoned manners of the time spared neither men nor those whom they esteemed as gods, the famous <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and safety of the commonwealth began to decline. What progress the worst <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> made from that time forward, and with how great mischief to the interests of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the Empire went on, it would take too long to rehearse. Let them hear their own satirist speaking playfully yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> thus:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>Once poor, and therefore chaste, in former times
<br>Our matrons were; no luxury found room
<br>In low-roofed houses and bare walls of loam;
<br>Their hands with labour burdened while 'tis light,
<br>A frugal sleep supplied the quiet night;
<br>While, pinched with want, their hunger held them strait,
<br>When Hannibal was hovering at the gate;
<br>But wanton now, and lolling at our ease,
<br>We suffer all the inveterate ills of peace
<br>And wasteful riot, whose destructive charms
<br>Revenge the vanquished world of our victorious arms.
<br>No crime, no lustful postures are unknown,
<br>Since poverty, our guardian-god, is gone. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>Why, then, do you expect me to multiply examples of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which were brought in by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> uplifted by prosperity, seeing that among themselves, those who observed events with somewhat closer attention discerned that Rome had more reason to regret the departure of its poverty than of its opulence; because in its poverty the integrity of its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was secured, but through its opulence, dire corruption, more terrible than any invader, had taken violent possession not of the walls of the city, but of the mind of the State?</p>

<p>17. Thanks be unto the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has sent unto us unprecedented help in resisting these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For whither might not men have been carried away by that flood of the appalling <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, whom would it have spared, and in what depths would it not have engulfed its victims, had not the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, resting on such a solid rock of authority (so to speak), been planted too high and too strong for the flood to sweep it away? So that by laying hold of its strength we may become steadfast, and not be carried off our feet and overwhelmed in the mighty whirlpool of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsels and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> impulses of this world. For when the empire was sinking in the vile abyss of utterly depraved manners, and of the effete ancient religion, it was signally important that heavenly authority should come to the rescue, persuading men to the practice of <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty, continence, benevolence, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, and concord among themselves, as well as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and all the other bright and sterling <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of life&mdash;not only with a view to the spending of this present life in the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> way, nor only with a view to secure the most perfect bond of concord in the earthly commonwealth, but also in order to the obtaining of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and a place in the divine and celestial republic of a people which shall endure for ever&mdash; a republic to the citizenship of which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity admit us; so that, while absent from it on our pilgrimage here, we may patiently tolerate, if we cannot correct, those who desire, by leaving <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> unpunished, to give stability to that republic which the early Romans founded and enlarged by their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, when, though they had not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God which could bring them, by a religion of saving power, to the commonwealth which is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, they did nevertheless observe a certain integrity of its own kind, which might suffice for founding, enlarging, and preserving an earthly commonwealth. For in the most opulent and illustrious Empire of Rome, God has shown how great is the influence of even civil <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> without <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, in order that it might be understood that, when this is added to such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, men are made citizens of another commonwealth, of which the king is Truth, the law is Love, and the duration is Eternity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>18. Who can help feeling that there is something simply ridiculous in their attempt to compare with Christ, or rather to put in a higher place, Apollonius and Apuleius, and others who were most skilful in magical arts? Yet this is to be tolerated with less impatience, because they bring into comparison with Him these men rather than their own gods; for Apollonius was, as we must admit, a much worthier character than that author and perpetrator of innumerable gross acts of immorality whom they call Jupiter. <q>These legends about our gods,</q> they reply, <q>are fables.</q> Why, then, do they go on praising that luxurious, licentious, and manifestly profane prosperity of the Republic, which invented these <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> crimes of the gods, and not only left them to reach the ears of men as fables, but also exhibited them to the eyes of men in the theatres; in which, more numerous than their deities were the crimes which the gods themselves were well pleased to see openly perpetrated in their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, whereas they should have punished their worshippers for even tolerating such spectacles? <q>But,</q> they reply, <q>those are not the gods themselves whose worship is celebrated according to the lying invention of such fables.</q> Who, then, are they who are propitiated by the practising in worship of such abominations? Because, forsooth, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> has exposed the perversity and chicanery of those devils, by whose power also magical arts deceive the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and because it has made this patent to the world, and, having brought out the distinction between the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and these malignant adversaries, has warned men to be on their guard against them, showing them also how this may be done&mdash;it is called an enemy to the Republic, as if, even though temporal prosperity could be secured by their aid, any amount of adversity would not be preferable to the prosperity obtained through such means. And yet it pleased God to prevent men from being perplexed in this matter; for in the age of the comparative darkness of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, in which is the covering of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, He distinguished the first nation which worshipped the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and despised false gods by such remarkable prosperity in this world, that any one may perceive from their case that prosperity is not at the disposal of devils, but only of Him whom <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> serve and devils <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>19. Apuleius (of whom I choose rather to speak, because, as our own countryman, he is better <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us Africans), though born in a place of some note,  and a man of superior education and great eloquence, never succeeded, with all his magical arts, in reaching, I do not say the supreme power, but even any subordinate office as a magistrate in the Empire. Does it seem probable that he, as a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, voluntarily despised these things, who, being the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of a province, was so ambitious of greatness that he gave spectacles of gladiatorial combats, provided the dresses worn by those who fought with wild beasts in the circus, and, in order to get a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of himself erected in the town of Coea, the birthplace of his wife, appealed to law against the opposition made by some of the citizens to the proposal, and then, to prevent this from being forgotten by posterity, published the speech delivered by him on that occasion? So far, therefore, as concerns worldly prosperity, that magician did his utmost in order to success; whence it is manifest that he failed not because he was not wishful, but because he was not able to do more. At the same time we admit that he defended himself with brilliant eloquence against some who imputed to him the crime of practising magical arts; which makes me wonder at his panegyrists, who, in affirming that by these arts he wrought some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, attempt to bring evidence contradicting his own defence of himself from the charge. Let them, however, examine whether, indeed, they are bringing <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> testimony, and he was guilty of pleading what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be false. Those who pursue magical arts only with a view to worldly prosperity or from an accursed curiosity, and those also who, though innocent of such arts, nevertheless praise them with a dangerous admiration, I would exhort to give heed, if they be wise, and to observe how, without any such arts, the position of a shepherd was exchanged for the dignity of the kingly office by David, of whom Scripture has faithfully recorded both the sinful and the meritorious actions, in order that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both how to avoid offending <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how, when He has been offended, His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> may be appeased.</p>

<p>20. As to those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, however, which are performed in order to excite the wonder of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they do greatly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> who compare <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> magicians with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, who completely eclipse them by the fame of their great <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. How much more do they <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> if they compare them with Christ, of whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, so incomparably superior to magicians of every name, foretold that He would come both in the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, which he took in being born of the Virgin, and in the divine nature, in which He is never separated from the Father!</p>

<p>I see that I have written a very long letter, and yet have not said all concerning Christ which might meet the case either of those who from sluggishness of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> are unable to comprehend divine things, or of those who, though endowed with acuteness, are kept back from discerning <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> through their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of contradiction and the prepossession of their minds in favour of long-cherished <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Howbeit, take note of anything which influences them against our doctrine, and write to me again, so that, if the Lord help us, we may, by letters or by treatises, furnish an answer to all their objections. May you, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of the Lord, be <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> in Him, my noble and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> distinguished lord, my son dearly beloved and longed for!</p>
