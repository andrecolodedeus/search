<h1>Letter 139</h1>

<p><strong>To Apronius</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Of Apronius nothing is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; but from the mention of Innocent (for whom see Letter CXLIII.) it seems a fair inference that he lived in the West. Jerome here congratulates him on his steadfastness in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and exhorts him to come to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. He then touches on the mischief done by Pelagius and complains that his own <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> has been destroyed by him or by his partisans. The date of the letter is A.D. 417.</span> </p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not by what wiles of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> it has come to pass that all your toil and the efforts of the reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Innocent  and my own <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and wishes seem for the moment to produce no effect. God be thanked that you are well and that the fire of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> glows in you even when you are in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> wiles. My greatest <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> is to hear that my spiritual sons are fighting in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Christ; and assuredly He in whom we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> will so quicken this <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of ours that we shall be glad freely to shed our blood in defence of His <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>I grieve to hear that a noble <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> has been subverted,  for what reason I cannot learn; for the bearer of the letter could give me no information. We may well grieve over the loss of our common friends and ask Christ the only potentate and Lord <span class="stiki" id="note303893"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:15</a></span> to have mercy upon them. At the same time we have deserved to receive punishment at God's hand for we  have harboured the enemies of the Lord.</p>

<p>The best course you can take is to leave everything and to come to the East, before all to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places; for everything is now quiet here. The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have not, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, purged the venom from their breasts, but they do not venture to open their impious mouths. They are <q>like the deaf adder that stops her ear.</q>  Salute your reverend brothers on my behalf.</p>

<p>As for our house,  so far as fleshly <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> is concerned, it has been completely destroyed by the onslaughts of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; but by the mercy of Christ it is still filled with spiritual riches. To live on bread is better than to lose the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>
