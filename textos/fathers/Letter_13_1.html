<h1>Letter 13</h1>

<p> <em>(For 341.) Coss. Marcellinus, Probinus; Pr&aelig;f. Longinus; Indict. xiv; Easter-day, xiii Kal. Maii, xxiv Pharmuthi; &AElig;ra Dioclet. 57.</em></p>

<p>Again, my beloved brethren, I am ready to notify to you the saving feast , which will take place according to annual custom. For although the opponents of Christ  have oppressed you together with us with afflictions and sorrows; yet, God having comforted us by our mutual <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> , behold, I write to you even from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. Keeping the feast here with the brethren, still I keep it with you also in will and in spirit, for we send up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in common to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, 'Who has granted us not only to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, but also now to suffer for His sake <span class="stiki" id="note284367"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse29">Philippians&nbsp;1:29</a></span>.' For troubled as we are, because we are so far from you, He moves us to write, that by a letter we might comfort ourselves, and provoke one another to good.  For, indeed, numerous afflictions and bitter <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> directed against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have been against us. For <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, corrupt in their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, untried in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, rising against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, violently <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and of the brethren, some are scourged and others torn with stripes, and hardest of all, their insults reach even to the Bishops. Nevertheless, it is not becoming, on this account, that we should neglect the feast. But we should especially remember it, and not at all forget its commemoration from time to time. Now the unbelievers do not consider that there is a season for feasts, because they spend all their lives in revelling and follies; and the feasts which they keep are an occasion of grief rather than of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. But to us in this present life they are above all an uninterrupted passage [to heaven]&mdash; it is indeed our season. For such things as these serve for exercise and trial, so that, having approved ourselves <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> and chosen servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we may be fellow-heirs with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.  For thus Job: 'The whole world is a place of trial to men upon the earth. ' Nevertheless, they are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in this world by afflictions, labours, and sorrows, to the end that each one may receive of God such reward as is meet for him, as He says by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, 'I am the Lord, Who tries the hearts, and searches the reins, to give to every one according to his ways <span class="stiki" id="note284371"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:10</a></span>.'</p>

<p>2. Not that He first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the things of a man on his being <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> (for He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them all before they come to pass), but because He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and philanthropic, He distributes to each a due reward according to his actions, so that every man may exclaim, Righteous is the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a>! As the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says again, 'The Lord tries the just, and discerns the reins. ' Again, for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> He tries each one of us, either that to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not, <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be manifested by means of those who are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, as was said respecting Job; 'Do you think that I was revealed to you for any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, than that you should be seen righteous ?' or that, when men come to a sense of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, they may be able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of what manner they are, and so may either repent of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, or abide confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, when troubled by afflictions, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, and hunger and thirst, 'in everything was a conqueror, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, Who loved us <span class="stiki" id="note284374"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse37">Romans&nbsp;8:37</a></span>.' Through suffering he was weak indeed in body, yet, believing and hoping, he was made strong in spirit, and his strength was made perfect in weakness <span class="stiki" id="note284375"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse9">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:9</a></span> .</p>

<p>3. The other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> also, who had a like confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, accepted a like probation with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, as Job said, 'Blessed be the name of the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note284376"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job&nbsp;1:21</a></span>.' But the Psalmist, 'Search me, O Lord, and try me: prove my reins and my heart. ' For since, when the strength is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, it convinces the foolish, they perceiving the cleansing and the advantage resulting from the divine fire, were not discouraged in trials like these, but they rather delighted in them, suffering no injury at all from the things which happened, but being seen to shine more brightly, like gold from the fire , as he said, who was tried in such a school of discipline as this; 'You have tried my heart, You have visited me in the night-season; You have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> me, and hast not found iniquity in me, so that my mouth shall not speak of the works of men. ' But those whose actions are not restrained by law, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of nothing beyond eating and drinking and dying, account trials as danger. They soon stumble at them, so that, being untried in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they are given over to a reprobate <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and do those things which are not seemly. <span class="stiki" id="note284380"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;1:28</a></span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, when urging us to such exercises as these, and having before measured himself by them, says, 'Therefore I take pleasure in afflictions, in infirmities.' And again, 'Exercise yourself unto godliness. ' For since he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> that befell those who chose to live in godliness, he wished his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to meditate beforehand on the difficulties connected with godliness; that when trials should come, and affliction arise, they might be able to bear them easily, as having been exercised in these things. For in those things wherewith a man has been conversant in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, he ordinarily experiences a hidden <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. In this way, the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, becoming at first conversant with difficulties, were quickly perfected in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, regarding as nought the injury of the body, while they contemplated the expected rest.</p>

<p>4. But all those who 'call their lands by their own names ,' and have wood, and hay, and stubble <span class="stiki" id="note284383"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> in their thoughts; such as these, since they are strangers to difficulties, become aliens from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Had they however <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that 'tribulation perfects patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope makes not ashamed,' they would have exercised themselves, after the example of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who said, 'I keep under my body and bring it into subjection, lest when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. ' They would easily have borne the afflictions which were brought upon them to prove them from time to time, if the prophetic admonition <span class="stiki" id="note284385"><a href="../bible/lam003.htm#verse27">Lamentations&nbsp;3:27</a></span> had been listened to by them; 'It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man to take up Your yoke in his youth; he shall sit alone and shall be silent, because he has taken Your yoke upon him. He will give his cheek to him who smites him; he will be filled with reproaches. Because the Lord does not cast away for ever; for when He abases, He is gracious, according to the multitude of His tender mercies. ' For though all these things should proceed from the enemies, stripes, insults, reproaches, yet shall they avail nothing against the multitude of God's tender mercies; for we shall quickly recover from them since they are merely temporal, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is always gracious, pouring out His tender mercies on those who please [Him]. Therefore, my beloved brethren, we should not look at these temporal things, but fix our attention on those which are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. Though affliction may come, it will have an end, though insult and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, yet are they nothing to the hope which is set [before us]. For all present matters are trifling compared with those which are future; the sufferings of this present time not being worthy to be compared with the hope that is to come.  For what can be compared with the kingdom? Or what is there in comparison with life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>? Or what is all we could give here, to that which we shall inherit yonder? For we are 'heirs of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and joint-heirs with Christ <span class="stiki" id="note284388"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;8:17</a></span>.' Therefore it is not right, my beloved, to consider afflictions and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, but the hopes which are laid up for us because of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>.</p>

<p>5. Now to this the example of Issachar, the patriarch, may persuade, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284389"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;49:14</a></span> says, 'Issachar desires that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, resting between the heritages; and when he saw that the rest was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and the land fertile , he bowed his shoulder to labour, and became a husbandman.' Being consumed by divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, like the spouse in the Canticles, he gathered abundance from the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, for his mind was captivated not by the old alone, but by both the heritages. And hence as it were, spreading his wings, he beheld afar off 'the rest' which is in heaven, and&mdash;since this 'land' consists of such beautiful works&mdash;how much more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the heavenly [country] must also [consist] of such ; for the other is ever new, and grows not old. For this 'land' passes away, as the Lord said; but that which is ready to receive the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. Now when Issachar, the patriarch, saw these things, he joyfully made his boast of afflictions and toils, bowing his shoulders that he might labour. And he did not contend with those who smote him, neither was he disturbed by insults; but like a strong man triumphing the more by these things, and the more earnestly tilling his land, he received profit from it. The Word scattered the seed, but he watchfully cultivated it, so that it brought forth fruit, even a hundred-fold.</p>

<p>6. Now what does this mean, my beloved, but that we also, when the enemies are arrayed against us, should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in afflictions <span class="stiki" id="note284392"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;5:3</a></span>, and that when we are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, we should not be discouraged, but should the rather press after the crown of the high calling  in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>? And that being insulted, we should not be disturbed, but should give our cheek to the smiter, and bow the shoulder? For the lovers of pleasure and the lovers of enmity are tried, as says the blessed Apostle James, 'when they are drawn away by their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and enticed <span class="stiki" id="note284394"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse14">James&nbsp;1:14</a></span>.' But let us, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that we suffer for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that those who deny the Lord smite and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> us, 'count it all <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, my brethren,' according to the words of James, 'when we fall into trials of various <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the trial of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> works patience. ' Let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as we keep the feast, my brethren, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is ordered in the time of affliction. For our Saviour did not redeem us by inactivity, but by suffering for us He abolished death. And respecting this, He intimidated to us before, saying, 'In the world you shall have tribulation <span class="stiki" id="note284396"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;16:33</a></span>.' But He did not say this to every man, but to those who diligently and faithfully perform good service to Him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> beforehand, that they should be <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> who would live godly toward Him.</p>

<p>7. 'But evil-doers and sorcerers will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived <span class="stiki" id="note284397"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:13</a></span>.' If therefore, like those expounders of dreams and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a> who professed to give signs, these <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> men being drunk, not with wine, but with their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, make a profession of <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in their threats, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them not; but since we are tried, let us <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> ourselves, not being drawn away by them. For so God warned His people by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying, 'If there shall rise up among you a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or a dreamer of dreams, and shall give signs and tokens, and the sign or the token shall come to pass which he spoke to you, saying, Let us go and serve strange gods, which you have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; you shall not hearken unto the words of that <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or that dreamer of dreams. For the Lord your God tries you, that He may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord your God with all your heart <span class="stiki" id="note284398"><a href="../bible/deu013.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;13:1-3</a></span>.' So we, when we are tried by these things, will not separate ourselves from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But let us now keep the feast, my beloved, not as introducing a day of suffering, but of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by Whom we are fed every day. Let us be mindful of Him Who was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> in the days of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>; for we celebrate this, because Christ the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note284399"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span> He Who once brought His people out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and has now abolished death, and him that had the power of death, that is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284400"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;2:14</a></span>, will likewise now turn him to shame, and again grant aid to those who are troubled, and cry unto God day and night <span class="stiki" id="note284401"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;18:7</a></span> .</p>

<p>8. We begin the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">fast of forty days</a> on the thirteenth of Phamenoth (9 Mar.), and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> week of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> on the eighteenth of Pharmuthi (Apr. 13); and resting on the seventh day, being the twenty-third (Apr. 18), and the first of the great week having dawned on the twenty-fourth of the same month Pharmuthi (Apr. 19), let us reckon from it till Pentecost. And at all times let us sing praises, calling on Christ, being delivered from our enemies by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, through Whom to the Father be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Greet one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. All those who are here with me salute you. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, my beloved brethren, that you may have health in the Lord.</p>
