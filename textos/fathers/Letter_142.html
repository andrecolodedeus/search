<h1>Letter 142</h1>

<p> <em>To the Same.</em></p>

<p>I have already addressed your reverence in another letter, and have delivered it to your much respected brethren. Now again I address your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. I am induced to do so both by your admirable life, and by the praiseworthy <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which you have shown on behalf of the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, fearless alike of imperial power and of episcopal combination. For granted that the majority of the council consented under coercion, still they did confirm the new fangled <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by their signatures. Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, however, was shaken by none of these things, but abided by the ancient doctrines which the Lord, by means of both the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, has taught the churches to hold. These decrees I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that I may preserve, and keep to the end my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and confession in one Father, one Son and one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the only begotten made no addition to the number of the Trinity. Even after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> the Trinity is still a Trinity. This is the teaching I have received from the beginning; this has been my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; in this was I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; this have I preached; in this have I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, this I continue to hold. Of them that utter a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> about the Father the Lord has said <q>When he speaks a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a> he speaks of his own,</q>  for what is said of the teacher is appropriate to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. So these men who employ lies against me speak of their own, and do not describe what is mine. I am comforted by my Master's words <q>Blessed are you when men shall revile you and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you and shall say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> for my sake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven.</q> </p>

<p>I entreat your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that I may not have my part among the wrong doers, but among them that suffer wrong on account of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>.</p>
