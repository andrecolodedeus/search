<h1>Letter 143</h1>

<p> <em>To Andrew, Monk of Constantinople.</em> </p>

<p>I have never seen your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> nor have we ever communicated by letter, but I have become warmly attached to you. What has wrought the charm and continues to inflame it is the report unanimously brought by the tasters of your honey. All express admiration of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the brightness of your life, the constancy of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the harmoniousness of your character, the attractiveness and sweetness of your society and all the other characteristics of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> foster child of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. For all these reasons I am attached to your godliness, and my longing has made me even begin a correspondence; but, my dear sir, grant me as soon as possible what I desire and let me have written communication from you. For when friends are at a distance considerable comfort is given them by epistolary communication. You will write to no man of heterodox opinions, but to one nurtured in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and preacher not of a quaternity but of a Trinity, for in reality I see little difference in the impiety of those who have the hardihood to endeavour to contract into one the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of the Only-begotten and those who endeavour to divide <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> made man, into two sons; if such indeed there be; I cannot think so; but <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, Eunomians, and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarians</a> too have ever shamelessly fabricated this <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and indeed laborious students may easily perceive that our far famed Fathers,  lights of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, laboured at the hands of the foes of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> under this accusation which is now levelled against me by the most excellent champions of the new fangled <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Our wise Lord has laid bare their impiety, for He could not endure to confirm the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> by His long suffering.</p>

<p>Be sure then, sir, that you will be writing to one of like sentiments with your own; and of this you can easily assure yourself from my copious writings.</p>

<p>Write then to me in return, and again your letter, by God's leave, shall serve to kindle affection. And before you write, give me the help of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and beseech our good Lord to guide my feet into the right road, that I may travel the rest of my journey in accordance with His <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. You who have won right of access from your unstained life will easily persuade Him Who is eager to give us His good gifts.</p>
