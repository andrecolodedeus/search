<h1>Letter 143 (A.D. 412)</h1>

<p>To Marcellinus, my noble lord, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> distinguished, my son very much beloved, Augustine sends greetings in the Lord.

<p>1. Desiring to reply to the letter which I received from you through our holy brother, my co-bishop Boniface, I have sought for it, but have not found it. I have recalled to <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, however, that you asked me in that letter how the magicians of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> could, after all the water of Egypt had been turned into blood, find any with which to imitate the miracle. There are two ways in which the question is commonly answered: either that it was possible for water to have been brought from the sea, or, which is more credible, that these plagues were not inflicted on the district in which the children of Israel were; for the clear, express statements to this effect in some parts of that scriptural narrative entitle us to assume this in places where the statement is omitted.

<p>2. In your other letter, brought to me by the presbyter Urbanus, a question is proposed, taken from a passage not in the Divine Scriptures, but in one of my own books, namely, that which I wrote on Free Will. On questions of this kind, however, I do not bestow much labour; because. even if the statement objected to does not admit of unanswerable vindication, it is mine only; it is not an utterance of that Author whose words it is impiety to reject, even when, through our misapprehension of their meaning, the interpretation which we put on them deserves to be rejected. I freely confess, accordingly, that I endeavour to be one of those who write because they have made some progress, and who, by-means of writing, make further progress. If, therefore, through inadvertence or want of knowledge, anything has been stated by me which may with good reason be condemned, not only by others who are able to discover this, but also by myself (for if I am making progress, I ought, at least after it has been pointed out, to see it), such a mistake is not to be regarded with surprise or grief, but rather forgiven, and made the occasion of congratulating me, not, of course, on having erred, but on having renounced an error. For there is an extravagant perversity in the self-love of the man who desires other men to be in error, that the fact of his having erred may not be discovered. How much better and more profitable is it that in the points in which he has erred others should not err, so that he may be delivered from his error by their advice, or, if he refuse this, may at least have no followers in his error. For, if God permit me, as I desire, to gather together and point out, in a work devoted to this express purpose, all the things which most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> displease me in my books, men will then see how far I am from being a partial judge in my own case.

<p>3. As for you, however, who love me warmly, if, in opposing those by whom, whether through <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> or ignorance or superior intelligence, I am censured, you maintain the position that I have nowhere in my writings made a mistake, you labour in a hopeless enterprise &mdash; you have undertaken a bad <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, in which, even if myself were judge, you must be easily worsted; for it is no pleasure to me that my dearest friends should think me to be such as I am not, since assuredly they love not me, but instead of me another under my name, if they love not what I am, but what I am not; for in so far as they know me, or believe what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> concerning me, I am loved by them; but in so far as they ascribe to me what they do not know to be in me, they love another person, such as they suppose me to be. Cicero, the prince of Roman orators, says of some one, "He never uttered a word which he would wish to recall." This commendation, though it seems to be the highest possible, is nevertheless more likely to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of a consummate fool than of a man perfectly wise; for it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of idiots,' that the more absurd and foolish they are, and the more their opinions diverge from those universally held, the more likely are they to utter no word which they will wish to recall; for to regret an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or foolish, or ill-timed word is characteristic of a wise man. If, however, the words quoted are taken in a good sense, as intended to make us believe that some one was such that, by reason of his speaking all things wisely, he never uttered any word which he would wish to recall -- this we are, in accordance with sound <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, to believe rather concerning men of God, who spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, than concerning the man whom Cicero commends. For my part, so far am I from this excellence, that if I have uttered no word which I would wish to recall, it must be because I resemble more the idiot than the wise man. The man whose writings are most worthy of the highest authority is he who has uttered no word, I do not say which it would: be his desire, but which it would be his duty to recall. Let him that has not attained to this occupy the second rank through his humility, I since he cannot take the first rank through his wisdom. Since he has been unable, with all his: care, to exclude every. expression whose use may be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> regretted, let him acknowledge his regret for anything which, as he may now have discovered, ought not to have been said.

<p>4. Since, therefore, the words spoken by me which I would if I could recall, are not, as my very dear friends suppose, few or none, but perhaps even more than my enemies <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, I am not gratified by such commendation as Cicero's sentence, "He never uttered a word which he would wish to recall," but I am deeply distressed by the saying of Horace, "The word once uttered cannot be recalled." This is the reason why I keep beside me, longer than you wish or patiently bear, the books which I have written on difficult and important questions on the book of Genesis and the doctrine of the Trinity, hoping that, if it be impossible to avoid having some things which may deservedly be found fault with, the number of these may at least be smaller than it might have been, if, through impatient haste, the works had been published without due deliberation; for you, as your letters indicate (our holy brother and co-bishop Florentius having written me to this effect), are urgent for the publication of these works now, in order that they may be defended in my own lifetime by myself, when, perhaps, they may begin to be assailed in some particulars, either through the cavilling of enemies or the misapprehensions of friends. You say this doubtless because you think there is nothing in them which might with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be censured, otherwise you would not exhort me to publish the books, but rather to revise them more carefully. But I fix my eye rather on those who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judges, sternly impartial, between whom and myself I wish, in the first place, to make sure of my ground, so that the only faults coming to be censured by them may be those which it was impossible for me to observe, though using the most diligent scrutiny.

<p>5. Notwithstanding what I have just said, I am prepared to defend the sentence in the third book of my treatise on Free Will, in which, discoursing on the rational substance, I have expressed my opinion in these words: "The soul, appointed to occupy a body inferior in nature to itself after the entrance of sin, governs its own body, not absolutely according to its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, but only in so far as the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> permit." I bespeak the particular attention of those who think that I have here fixed and defined, as ascertained concerning the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> soul, either that it comes by propagation from the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or that it has, through sins committed in a higher celestial life, incurred the penalty of being shut up in a corruptible body. Let them, I say, observe that the words in question have been so carefully weighed by me, that while they hold fast what I regard as certain, namely, that after the sin of the first man, all other men. have been born and continue to be born in that sinful flesh, for the healing of which "the likeness of sinful flesh "s came in the person of the Lord, they are also so chosen as not to pronounce upon' any one of those four opinions which I have in the sequel expounded and distinguished -- not attempting to establish any one of them as preferable to the others, but disposing in the meantime of the matter under discussion, and reserving the consideration of these opinions, so that whichever of them may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, praise should unhesitatingly be given to God.

<p>6. For whether all souls are derived by propagation from the first, or are in the case of each individual specially created, or being created apart from the body are sent into it, or introduce themselves into it of their own accord, without doubt this creature endowed with reason, namely, the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> soul- appointed to occupy an inferior, that is, an earthly body- after the entrance of sin, does not govern its own body absolutely according to its <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>.' For I did not say, "after his sin," or "after he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>," but after the entrance of sin, that whatever might afterwards, if possible, be determined by reason as to the question whether the sin was his own or the sin of the first parent of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, it might be perceived that in saying that "the soul, appointed, after the entrance of sin, to occupy an inferior body, does not govern its body absolutely according to its own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>," I stated what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for "the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit,' and in this we groan, being burdened," and "the corruptible body weighs down the soul,"; in short, who can enumerate all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> arising from the infirmity of the flesh, which shall assuredly cease when "this corruptible shall have put on incorruption," so that "that which is mortal shall be swallowed up of life"? In that future condition, therefore, the soul shall govern its spiritual body with absolute freedom of will; but in the meantime its freedom is not absolute, but conditioned by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, according to which -it is fixed, that bodies having experienced birth experience death, and having grown to maturity decline in old age. For the soul of the first man did, before the entrance of sin, govern his body with perfect freedom of will, although that body was not yet spiritual, but animal; but after the entrance of sin, that is, after sin had been committed in that flesh from which sinful flesh was thenceforward to be propagated, the reasonable soul is so appointed to occupy an inferior body, that it does not govern its body with absolute freedom of will. That infant children, even before they have committed any sin of their own, are partakers of sinful flesh, is, in my opinion, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by their requiring to have it healed in them also, by the application in their baptism of the remedy provided in Him who came in the likeness of sinful flesh. But even those who do not acquiesce in this view have no just ground for taking offense at the sentence quoted from my book; for it is certain, if I am not mistaken. that even if the infirmity be the consequence not of sin, but of nature, it was at all events only after the entrance of sin that bodies having this infirmity began to be produced; for <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> was not created thus, and he did not beget any offspring before he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.

<p>7. Let my critics, therefore, seek other passages to censure, not only in my other more hastily published works, but also in these books of mine on Free Will. For I by no means deny that they may in this search discover opportunities of conferring a benefit on me; for if the books, having passed into so many hands, cannot now be corrected, I myself may, being still alive. Those words, however, so carefully selected by me to avoid committing myself to any one of the four opinions or theories regarding the soul's origin, are liable to censure only from those who think that my hesitation as to any definite view in a matter so obscure is blameworthy; against whom I do not defend myself by saying that I think it right to pronounce no opinion whatever on the subject, seeing that I have no doubt either that the soul is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> -- not in the same sense in which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, who alone has immortality, but in a certain way peculiar to itself -- or that the soul is a creature and not a part of the substance of the Creator, or as to any other thing which I regard as most certain concerning its nature. But seeing that the obscurity of this most <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> subject, the origin of the soul, compels me to do as I have done, let them rather stretch out a friendly hand to me, confessing my ignorance, and desiring to know whatever is the truth on the subject; and let them, if they can, teach or demonstrate to me what they may either have learned by the exercise of sound reason, or have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on indisputably plain testimony of the divine oracles. For if reason be found contradicting the authority of Divine Scriptures, it only deceives by a semblance of truth, however acute it be, for its deductions cannot in that case be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. On the other hand, if, against the most manifest and reliable testimony of reason, anything be set up claiming to have the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, he who does this does it through a misapprehension of what he has read, and is setting up against the truth not the real meaning of Scripture, which he has failed to discover, but an opinion of his own; he alleges not what he has found in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, but what he has found in himself as their interpreter.

<p>8. Let me give an example, to which I solicit your earnest attention. In a passage near the end of Ecclesiastes, where the author is speak-ling of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> dissolution through death separating the soul from the body, it is written, "Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it." A statement having the authority on which this one is based is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> beyond all dispute, and is not intended to deceive any one; yet if any one wishes to put upon it such an interpretation as may help him in attempting to support the theory of the propagation of souls, according to which all other souls are derived from that one which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to the first man, what is there said concerning the body under the name of "dust" (for obviously nothing else than body and soul are to be understood by "dust" and "spirit" in this passage) seems to favour his view; for he may affirm that the soul is said to return to God because of its being derived from the original stock of that soul which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> gave to the first man, in the same way as the body is said to return to the dust because of its being derived from the original stock of that body which was made of dust in the first man and therefore may argue that, from what we know perfectly as to the body, we ought to believe what is hidden from our observation as to the soul; for there is no difference of opinion as to the original stock of the body, but there is as to the original stock of the soul. In the text thus brought forward as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, statements are made concerning both, as if the manner of the return of each to its original was precisely similar in both -- the body, on the one hand, returning to the earth as it was, for thence was it taken when the first man was formed; the soul, on the other hand, returning to God, for He gave it when He breathed into the nostrils of the man whom He had formed the breath of life, and he became a living soul,' so that thenceforward the propagation of each part should go on from the corresponding part in the parent.

<p>9. If, however, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> account of the soul's origin be, that God gives to each individual man a soul, not propagated from that first soul, but created in some other way, the statement that the "spirit returns to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who gave it," is equally consistent with this view. The two other opinions regarding the soul's origin are, then, the only ones which seem to be excluded by this text. For in the first place, as to the opinion that every man's soul is made separately within him at the time of his creation, it is supposed that, if this were the case, the soul should have been spoken of as returning, not to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who gave it, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who made it; for the word "gave" seems to imply that that which could be given had already a separate <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. The words "returns to God" are further insisted upon by some, who say, How could it return to a place where it had never been before? Accordingly they maintain that, if the soul is to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have never been with God before, the words should have been "it goes," or "goes on," or "goes away," rather than it" returns" to God. In like manner, as to the opinion that each soul glides of its own accord into its body, it is not easy to explain how this theory is reconcilable with the statement that God gave it. The words of this scriptural passage are consequently somewhat adverse to these two opinions, namely, the one which supposes each soul to be created in its own body, and the one which supposes each soul to introduce itself into its own body spontaneously. But there is no difficulty in showing that the words are consistent with either of the other two opinions, namely, that all souls are derived by propagation from the one first created, or that, having been created and kept in readiness with God, they are given to each body as required.

<p>10. Nevertheless, even if the theory that each soul is created in its own body may not be wholly excluded by this text -- for if its advocates affirm that God is here said to have given the spirit (or the soul) in the same way as He is said to have given us eyes, ears, hands, or other such members, which were not made elsewhere by Him, and kept in store that He might give them, i.e. add and join them to our bodies, but are made by Him in that body to which He is said to have given them -- I do not see what could be said in reply, unless, perchance, the opinion could be refuted, either by other passages of Scripture, or by valid reasoning. In like manner, those who think that each soul flows of its own accord into its body take the words" God gave it" in the sense in which it is said, "He gave them up to uncleanness, through the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of their own hearts."a Only one word, therefore, remains apparently irreconcilable with the theory that each soul is made in its own body, namely, the word "returns," in the expression "returns to God;" for in what sense can the soul return to Him with whom it has not formerly been? By this one word alone are the supporters of this one of the four opinions embarrassed. And yet I do not think that this opinion ought to be held as refuted by this one word, for it may be possible to show that in the ordinary style of scriptural language it may be quite correct to use the word "return," as signifying the spirit created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> returns to Him not because of its having been with Him before its union with the body, but because of its having received being from His creative power.

<p>11. I have written these things in order to show that whoever is disposed to maintain and vindicate any one of these four theories of the soul's origin, must bring forward, either from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> received into <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> authority, passages which do not admit of any other interpretation -- as the statement that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made man -- or reasonings founded on premises so obviously <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that to call them in question would be <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, such as the statement that none but the living are capable of knowledge or of error; for a statement like this does not require the authority of Scripture to prove its truth, as if the common sense of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> did not of itself announce its truth with such transparent cogency of reason, that whoever contradicts it must be held to be hopelessly mad. If any one .is able to produce such arguments in discussing _the very obscure question of the soul's origin, let him help me in my ignorance; but if he cannot do this, let him forbear from blaming my hesitation on the question.

<p>12. As to the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of the Holy Mary, if what I have written on this subject does not suffice to prove that it was possible, we must refuse to believe every record of anything miraculous having taken place in the body of any. If, however, the objection to believing this miracle is, that it happened only once, ask the friend who is still perplexed by this, whether instances may not be quoted from secular literature of events which were, like this one, unique, and which, nevertheless, are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, not merely as fables are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by the simple, but with that faith with which the history of facts is received -- ask him, I beseech you, this question. For if he says that nothing of this kind is to be found in these writings, he ought to have such instances pointed out to him; if he admits this, the question is decided by his admission.
