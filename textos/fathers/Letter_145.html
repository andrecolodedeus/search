<h1>Letter 145</h1>

<p> <em>To the Monks of Constantinople.</em> </p>

<p>There is nothing new or surprising in the fact that the men who have made their tongues weapons against our God and Saviour should also aim their shafts of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> against His right minded servants. It must needs be that the servants who grieve sorely at the outrage inflicted on their Master should share it. That so it should be they have been forwarned by their Lord Himself, Who consoles His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with the words <q>If they have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> me they will also <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you.</q>  <q>If they have called the Master of the house <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, how much more shall they call them of His household.</q>  Then He cheered them by pointing out that <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> is easily detected, for He went on <q>There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</q>  I have often seen the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the divine prediction, but I see it with special clearness now. The authors of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> against me, who have bought my destruction for large sums of money, have been distinctly seen to be involved in the unsoundness of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>. They had hoped to cloke their own iniquity if only they could whet their tongues on the hone of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in order to wound me. For ever since I saw that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> long ago extinguished had been renewed by these men I never ceased to cry aloud, bearing my testimony in private and in public, as well in social gatherings as in the temples of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and strive to confute their conspiracy against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. They have consequently poured out their insults on my head, and allege that I preach two sons. But they ought to have convicted me to my face, not <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> me behind my back. They have done just the contrary. They tied me hand and foot at Cyrus by the imperial decree; they compelled the very righteous judges to condemn me without a trial, and delivered their most equitable sentence against a man who was five and thirty stages away. Such treatment was never suffered by any criminal charged with <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a> or <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> of the dead, by murderer or by adulterer. But for the present I will leave the judges alone, for the Lord is at hand <q>Who judges the world with righteousness and the people with his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q>  Who exacts an account not only of words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but even of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts. But think it right to refute the false charge which has been made. What <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> have they of my asserting two sons? Had I been one of the silent kind there might have been some ground for the suspicion, but my task has been to contend on behalf of the apostolic decrees, to bring the pasture of instruction to the Lord's flocks, and to this end I have written five and thirty books interpreting the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, and proving the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. The falsehoods these men have concocted are therefore easy of refutation. Tens on tens of thousands of hearers testify that I have taught the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and for any one who likes to bring them to the test my writings lie before the world. Not on behalf of a duality of sons, but of the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, against <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, against the recipients of the plague of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius, against the supporters of the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>, against the victims of the corruption of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, I have never ceased to struggle; trying to convince the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> that the Eternal Son of the ever living God is Himself Creator of the Universe; the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that about Him the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> uttered their predictions, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and Eunomians that He is of one substance, of one dignity and of equal power with the Father; <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion's</a> mad adherents that He is not only good but just; and Saviour not, as they fable, of another's works, but of His own. Once for all, fighting against each <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, I charge men to fall down and worship the one Son.</p>

<p>And what need is there of many words, when it is possible to refute <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in few? We provide that those who year by year come up for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should carefully learn the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> set forth at Nic&aelig;a by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Fathers; and initiating them as we have been bidden,  we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, pronouncing each name singly. Furthermore when performing divine service in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, both at the beginning and the decline of day and when dividing the day itself into three parts, we glorify the Father the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.  If, as our slanderers allege, we preach two sons, which do we glorify and which do we leave unworshipped? It were the wildest folly to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there are two sons, and to give the doxology to one alone. And who is so distraught as, while hearing the words of the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <q>one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,</q>  and again <q>there is one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by Whom are all things,</q>  to lay down the law at variance with the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and cut the one in two. But I am prating unnecessarily, for these men, nurtured in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> as they are, do not even dare to assert that they have ever heard me say anything of the kind; but they affirm that I preach two sons because I confess the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> of our Master Christ. And they refuse to perceive that every <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being has both an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and a mortal body; yet no one has hitherto been found to call <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> two Pauls because he has both <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, any more than Peter two Peters or <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> or Adam. Everyone recognises the distinction of the natures, and does not call one man two Pauls. Precisely in the same way, when styling <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> incarnate, both <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, as we have been taught by the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, we do not assert two sons, but we do confess the peculiar properties of the Godhead and of the manhood. The party however who deny the nature assumed of us men cannot hear these arguments without irritation.</p>

<p>It is only right that I should point out from what sources they have derived this impiety. Simon, Menander, Cerdo, and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> absolutely deny the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, and call the birth from a Virgin fable. <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, however, <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>, and Harmonius and their following, accept the conception of the Virgin and the birth; but they deny that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> took anything from the Virgin, but made as it were a transit through her as through a conduit, and appeared to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> in semblance only, and seeming to be a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in like manner as He was seen by <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and certain others of the ancients. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius on the contrary held that He assumed a body, but that the Godhead played the part of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in order that they may attribute to it what was lowly in His words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> did indeed assert that He assumed a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the body, not the reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is called animal or phytic.  Their contention is that the Godhead took the part of the mind. He had learned the distinction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and of mind from the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> that are without while <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says that man consists of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body. For we read <q>And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  And the Lord in the sacred <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> said to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <q>Fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> </p>

<p>So great is the divergence between the doctrines. These men have now done their best to outdo <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius, in their impiety and have now endeavoured to plant anew the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> sown of old by <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>, and afterwards uprooted by most excellent husbandmen. Like <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a> they have denied that the body of our Lord was assumed of our nature. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, following the footprints of the Apostles, contemplates in the Lord Christ both perfect Godhead and perfect manhood. For just as He took a body, not that He needed a body, but by its means to give <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> to all bodies; so too He took a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the guide of the body, that every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by its means might share His immutability. For even if <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, they are not however immutable; for they undergo many and frequent changes, as they experience pleasure, now from one object, and now from another. Whence it comes about that we <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> when we are changed and are inclined to what is worse. But after the resurrection our bodies enjoy <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and incorruptibility, and our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> impassibility and immutability. For this reason the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> took both a body and a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, preserved them free from all blame, and offered the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for the race. And this is why He is called our <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>; and He is named <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> not as God but as man. He makes the offering as man, and accepts the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If only Adam's body had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, it alone should have benefited by the cure. But since the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> not only shared in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but was first in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for first the thought forms an image of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and then carries it out by means of the body, it was just, I ween, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> too should be healed. But it is perhaps superfluous to demonstrate these points by reasoning, when the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> clearly proclaims them. This doctrine is distinctly taught by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David and the very divine Peter, the one foretelling from distant ages, and the other interpreting his prediction. The words of the first of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> are <q>David therefore being a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that God had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; he seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ that His <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was not left in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> neither His flesh did see corruption.</q> </p>

<p>Now he has given us much instruction on the same point in these few words. First he states that the assumed nature derives its descent from the loins of David; secondly that He took not a body only, but also an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and thirdly that He delivered body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to death, and, after taking them again, raised them as He would. His own words are <q>Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.</q>  But we have learned that the divine nature is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. What suffered was the passible, and the impassible remained impassible. For <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was made man not to render the impassible nature passible, but on the passible nature, by means of the Passion, to bestow the boon of impassibility. And the Lord Himself in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> at one time says <q>I have power to lay down my life and I have power to take it again, no man takes it from me but I lay it down of myself;</q> <q>That I may take it again.</q>  And again <q>Therefore does my Father <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me because I lay down my life for the sheep,</q>  and again <q>Now is my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> troubled</q>  <q>my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful even unto death</q>  and of His body He says <q>The bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world,</q>  and when He delivered the divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and broke the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> and distributed it, He added <q>This is my body which is being <em>broken</em> for you for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q>  and again <q>This is my blood which is shed for many for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q>  and again <q>Except you eat the flesh of the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> and drink His blood you have no life in you</q>  and <q>Whosoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life</q> <q>in himself</q> he adds.  Innumerable passages of the same character may be quoted, both in the old Testament and the new, pointing out the assumption both of the body and of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and that they are descended from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David. Joseph of Arimathea when he came to <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> begged the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, and the fourfold authority  of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> tells us how he received the body, wrapped it in the linen cloth, and committed it to the tomb. I do, indeed, sorrow and lament that I am compelled by the attacks of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to adduce against men supposed to be of one and the same <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with myself the arguments which I have already urged against the victims of the plague of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>&mdash;of whom, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, I have converted more than ten thousand, and brought them to Holy Baptism. What child of the church ever had any doubts on these points? Who has not cited this teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers? The works of the great Basil are full of it; as well, as those of his fellow soldiers Gregory and Amphilochius, and of those who in the West have been illustrious teachers of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, Damasus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of great Rome, and Ambrose of Milan; and <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian of Carthage</a> who for the sake of these doctrines won the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown. Five times was the famous Athanasius driven from his flock and compelled to dwell in exile; and in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of these doctrines strove too his master Alexander. Eustathius, Meletius, and Flavianus, luminaries of the East, and Ephraim, harp of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, who daily waters the people of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> with the streams of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; John and Atticus, loud heralds of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and men of an earlier age than they, <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>, <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, Justin, and Hippolytus, of whom the more part not only shine at the head of the company of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but also adorn the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> band.</p>

<p>He, too, who now rules great Rome and diffuses in all directions from the West the rays of right teaching, the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Leo, has expressed to me this distinctive mark of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in his own letters. All these have clearly taught that the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> and everlasting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ineffably begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, is one Son; and that after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> He was called both <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> and man, not because He was changed into manhood, for His nature is immutable, but because He took what was ours. They teach too that He was both impassible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and mortal and passible as man; but after the resurrection even in relation to His humanity He received impassibility and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, for, though the body remained a body, still it is impassible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, verily a divine body and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. This is distinctly told us by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> in the words <q>For our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q>  He does not say to <q>His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> but to <q>the body of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> and the Lord Himself, when He had said to His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> <q>There be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> coming in His Father's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q>  took them after six days into an exceeding high mountain, and was transfigured before them, and His face became as the sun, and His raiment was bright like the light.  By these means He showed the manner of the second advent. He taught that the assumed nature is not uncircumscribed (for this is characteristic of the Godhead alone) but that it shall send forth flashes of the divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and emit rays of light transcending the powers of the sense of sight. With this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> He was taken up; with this the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> said that He should come; for their words were <q>He who was taken from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven.</q>  When moreover He was seen by the divine <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> after the resurrection, He showed them both hands and feet; and to Thomas He showed also His side and the wounds of the nails and of the spear. For on account of those men who positively deny the assumption of the flesh, and further of those others who assert that after the resurrection the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the body was changed into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Godhead, He preserved unaltered the prints of the nails and of the spear. And while raising all other bodies free from every disfigurement,  in His own body He left the marks of His sufferings, to the end that deniers of the assumption of the body may be convicted of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by means of His sufferings; and holders of the notion that His body was changed into another nature may be taught by the print of the nails that it abides in its own proper qualities. Suppose any one to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that he has a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the body of the Lord did not remain a body after the resurrection in the fact that He came in to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> when the doors were shut, let such an one remember how He walked upon the sea while His body was still mortal, how He was born after keeping the seals of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> intact, and how again when encircled by them that were plotting against Him He frequently escaped from their hands. But why need I mention the Lord, who was not only man, but God before the ages, and to whom it was easy to do whatsoever He would? Let them tell how Habakkuk was translated from Jud&aelig;a into <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> in a moment of time and passed through the covering of the den, and brought the food to Daniel, and returned again. without destroying the seals of the den.  It is sheer foolishness to enquire into the manner of the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of the Lord, but in addition to what has been said it ought also to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that after the resurrection our bodies also will be incorruptible and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and being released from what is earthly will become light and &aelig;thereal. This moreover is distinctly taught us by the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> in the words <q>It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption, it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it is sown in dishonour it is raised in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body</q>  and in another place <q>We shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.</q>  If then the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> become light and &aelig;thereal and easily travel through the air, we cannot wonder that the Lord's body united to the Godhead of the only begotten, when, after the resurrection, it had become <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, entered in when the doors were shut.</p>

<p>Countless other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> might be quoted without difficulty from <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. But what has been already said is enough to show the drift of my teaching. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in one Father, one Son and one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; and I confess one Godhead, one Lordship, one substance and three hypostases. For the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the only begotten did not add to the number of the Trinity, and make the Trinity a quaternity, but, even after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> the Trinity was still a Trinity. And while confessing that the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was made man I do not deny the nature which He took, but confess, as I have said, both the nature which took and the nature which was taken. The union did not confound the properties of the natures. For if the air by receiving the light through all its parts does not cease to be air, nor yet at the same time destroy the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the light, for with our eyes we behold the light and by our feeling we recognise the air, as it meets us cold or hot, or moist or dry, so it were sheer folly to call the union of the Godhead and the manhood confusion. If created natures which share at once subordinate and temporal <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, when united and in some sense mingled, yet remain unimpaired, and, when the light withdraws, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the air is left alone, much more proper is it, I apprehend, for the nature which fashioned all things, when conjoined with and united to the nature which it assumed from us, to be acknowledged to continue itself in its purity, and in like manner to preserve unimpaired that which it had assumed. Gold, too, when brought in contact with the fire, participates both in the colour and power of fire, but it does not lose its own nature, but at the same time remains gold and has the active qualities of fire. In this manner also the Lord's body is a body, but impassible, incorruptible, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, of the Lord, divine and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> with the divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. It is not separated from the Godhead, nor yet is of any one else, save of the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself. For it does not show to us another person, but the only-begotten Himself clad in our nature.</p>

<p>This is the doctrine which I am continually preaching. They on the other hand who deny the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> wrought on our behalf have called me a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, adopting a course something like that of unchaste <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">females</a>, who, while they sell their own charms, assail honest <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with the insults of their profession, and apply language proper to their own wantonness to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who hold such wantonness in abhorrence. This is how <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> has acted. She has herself fallen willingly into the thraldom of base desire. She has lavished her servile adulation on a man of chaste character. Then, failing to entice him by her wiles, or to trap him in the snares of her voluptuous passion, she describes one who is faithful to purity as an adulterer.</p>

<p>But these men will be called to account by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as well for their devices against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as for the snares they have laid against me. I only charge those who have been influenced by the false accusations uttered against me to keep one ear for the accused, and not to give both to the accusers. In this manner they will fulfil the divine law which lays down <q>You shall not raise a false report,</q>  and <q>Judge righteously between every man and his brother.</q>  In these words the divine law charges us not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> uttered against the absent but to judge the accused face to face.</p>
