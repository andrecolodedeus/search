<h1>Letter 146</h1>

<p><strong>To Evangelus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Jerome refutes the opinion of those who make <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> equal to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, but in doing so himself makes <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> equal to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. The date of the letter is unknown.</span> </p>

<p>1. We read in Isaiah the words, <q>the fool will speak folly,</q>  and I am told that some one has been mad enough to put <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> before <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, that is, before <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For when the apostle clearly teaches that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> are the same as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, must not a mere server of tables and of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> <span class="stiki" id="note303928"><a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;6:1-2</a></span> be insane to set himself up arrogantly over men through whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the body and blood of Christ are produced?  Do you ask for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of what I say? Listen to this passage: <q><a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Timotheus, the servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, to all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>.</q>  Do you wish for another instance? In the Acts of the Apostles <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> thus speaks to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  of a single church: <q>Take heed unto yourselves and to all the flock, in the which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> has made you <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to feed the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.</q>  And lest any should in a spirit of contention argue that there must then have been more <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> than one in a single church, there is the following passage which clearly proves a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> to be the same. Writing to Titus the apostle says: <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>  in every city, as I had appointed you: if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. For a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be blameless as the steward of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303934"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse5">Titus&nbsp;1:5-7</a></span> And to Timothy he says: <q>Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, with the laying on of the hands of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbytery</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303935"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:14</a></span> Peter also says in his first epistle: <q>The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> which are among you I exhort, who am your fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that shall be revealed: feed the flock of Christ. ..taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly, according unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  In the Greek the meaning is still plainer, for the word used is <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x03C0;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BA;&#x03BF;&#x03C0;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6;&#x03BD;&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03C2;</span>, that is to say, overseeing, and this is the origin of the name overseer or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.  But perhaps the testimony of these great men seems to you insufficient. If so, then listen to the blast of the gospel trumpet, that son of thunder, <span class="stiki" id="note303939"><a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse17">Mark&nbsp;3:17</a></span> the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> whom Jesus loved <span class="stiki" id="note303940"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;13:23</a></span> and who reclining on the Saviour's breast drank in the waters of sound doctrine. One of his letters begins thus: <q>The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> unto the elect lady and her children whom I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;</q>  and another thus: <q>The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> unto the well-beloved Gaius whom I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  When subsequently one <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> was chosen to preside over the rest, this was done to remedy <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and to prevent each individual from rending the church of Christ by drawing it to himself. For even at Alexandria from the time of <a href="../cathen/09672c.htm">Mark the Evangelist</a> until the episcopates of Heraclas and Dionysius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> always named as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> one of their own number chosen by themselves and set in a more exalted position, just as an army elects a general, or as <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> appoint one of themselves whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be diligent and call him archdeacon. For what function, excepting ordination, belongs to a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that does not also belong to a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>? It is not the case that there is one church at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and another in all the world beside. <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and Britain, Africa and <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, India and the East worship one Christ and observe one rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If you ask for authority, the world outweighs its capital.  Wherever there is a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whether it be at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> or at Engubium, whether it be at Constantinople or at Rhegium, whether it be at Alexandria or at Zoan, his dignity is one and his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is one. Neither the command of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> nor the lowliness of poverty makes him more a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or less a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. All alike are successors of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. </p>

<p>2. But you will say, how comes it then that at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> is only ordained on the recommendation of a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>? To which I reply as follows. Why do you bring forward a custom which exists in one city only? Why do you oppose to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> a paltry exception which has given rise to arrogance and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>? The rarer anything is the more it is sought after. In India pennyroyal is more costly than pepper. Their fewness makes <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of consequence  while <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> are less thought of owing to their great numbers. But even in the <a href="../cathen/07424b.htm">church of Rome</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> stand while the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> seat themselves, although bad habits have by degrees so far crept in that I have seen a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, in the absence of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, seat himself among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and at social gatherings give his blessing to them.  Those who act thus must learn that they are wrong and must give heed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> words: <q>it is not reason that we should leave the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and serve tables.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303947"><a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;6:2</a></span> They must consider the reasons which led to the appointment of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> at the beginning. They must read the Acts of the Apostles and bear in mind their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> position.</p>

<p>Of the names <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the first denotes age, the second rank. In writing both to Titus and to Timothy the apostle speaks of the ordination of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, but says not a word of the ordination of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>; for the fact is that the word <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> includes <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> also. Again when a man is promoted it is from a lower place to a higher. Either then a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> should be ordained a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, from the lesser office, that is, to the more important, to prove that a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> is inferior to a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>; or if on the other hand it is the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> that is ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, this latter should recognize that, although he may be less highly paid than a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, he is superior to him in virtue of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. In fact as if to tell us that the traditions handed down by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were taken by them from the old testament, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> occupy in the church the same positions as those which were occupied by <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, his sons, and the <a href="../cathen/09206a.htm">Levites</a> in the temple. </p>
