<h1>Letter 147</h1>

<p><strong>To Sabinianus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Jerome writes in severe but moderate language to Sabinianus, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, calling on him to repent of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Of these he recounts at length the two most serious, an act of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and an attempt to seduce a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. The date of the letter is uncertain.</span> </p>

<p>1. Of old, when it had repented the Lord that he had anointed Saul to be king over <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>,  we are told that Samuel mourned for him; and again, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> heard that there was fornication among the Corinthians and such fornication as was not so much as named among the gentiles, <span class="stiki" id="note303950"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:1</a></span> he besought them to repent with these tearful words: <q>lest, when I come again, my God will <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> me among you and that I shall bewail many which have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303951"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:21</a></span> If an apostle or a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, themselves immaculate, could speak thus with a clemency embracing all, how much more earnestly should a sinner like me plead with a sinner like you. You have fallen and refuse to rise; you do not so much as lift your eyes to heaven; having wasted your father's substance you take pleasure in the husks that the swine eat;  and climbing the precipice of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> you fall headlong into the deep. You make your belly your God instead of Christ; you are a slave to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is in your shame; <span class="stiki" id="note303953"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians&nbsp;3:19</a></span> you fatten yourself like a victim for the slaughter, and imitate the lives of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, careless of their doom. <q>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that the goodness of God leads you to repentance. But after your hardness and impenitent heart you store up unto yourself <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against the day of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303954"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;2:4-5</a></span> Or is it that your heart is hardened, as <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> was, because your punishment is deferred and you are not smitten at the moment? The ten plagues were sent upon <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> not as by an <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> God but as by a warning father, and his day of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was prolonged until he repented of his repentance. Yet doom overtook him when he pursued through the wilderness the people whom he had previously let go and presumed to enter the very sea in the eagerness of his pursuit. For only in this one way could he learn the lesson that He is to be dreaded whom even the elements <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. He had said: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the Lord, neither will I let <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> go;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303955"><a href="../bible/exo005.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;5:2</a></span> and you imitate him when you say: <q>The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of the times that are far off.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303956"><a href="../bible/eze012.htm#verse27">Ezekiel&nbsp;12:27-28</a></span> Yet the same <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> confutes you with these words: <q>Thus says the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, There shall none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken shall be done.</q> David too says of the godless (and of godlessness you have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> yourself not a slight but an eminent example), that in this world they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in good fortune and say: <q>How does God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? And is there <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the Most High? Behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</q>  Then almost losing his footing and staggering where he stands he complains, saying <q>Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</q>  For he had previously said: <q>I was <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. For they have no regard for death,  but their strength is firm. They are not in trouble as other men are; neither are they plagued like other men. Therefore <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> compasses them about as a chain; <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> covers them as a garment. Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish. They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily. They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth.</q> </p>

<p>2. Does not this whole psalm seem to you to be written of yourself? Certainly you are hale and strong; and like a new apostle of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>, when you are found out in one city, you pass to another. <span class="stiki" id="note303961"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;10:23</a></span> You are in no need of money, no crushing blow strikes you down, neither are you plagued as other men who are not like you mere brute beasts. Therefore you are lifted up into <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> covers you as a garment. Out of your fat and bloated carcass you breathe out words fraught with death. You never consider that you must some day die, nor feel the slightest repentance when you have satisfied your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. You have more than heart can wish; and, not to be alone in your wrongdoing, you invent scandals concerning those who are God's servants. Though you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it not, it is against the most High that you are speaking iniquity and against the heavens that you are setting your mouth. It is no wonder that God's servants small and great are <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> by you, when your fathers did not scruple to call even the master of the house <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>. <q>The <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> is not above his master nor the servant above his lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303962"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;10:24-25</a></span> If they did this with the green tree, what will you do with me, the dry? <span class="stiki" id="note303963"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;23:31</a></span> Much in the same way also the offended <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in the book of Malachi gave expression to feelings like yours; for they said, <q>It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hosts? And now we call the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>; yea, they that work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered.</q> Yet the Lord afterwards threatens them with a day of judgment; and announcing beforehand the distinction that shall then be made between the righteous and the unrighteous, speaks to them thus: <q>Return ye,  and discern between the righteous and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, between him that serves God and him that serves him not.</q> </p>

<p>3. All this may perhaps seem to you matter for jesting, seeing that you take so much pleasure in comedies and lyrics and mimes like those of Lentulus;  although so blunted is your wit that I am not disposed to allow that you can understand even language so simple. You may treat the words of <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> with contempt, but Amos will still make answer to you: <q>Thus says the Lord, For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from him?</q>  For inasmuch as Damascus, Gaza, <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, Edom, the Ammonites and the Moabites, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> also and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, although God had often prophesied to them to turn and to repent, had refused to hear His voice, the Lord wishing to show that He had most just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> that he was going to bring upon them used the words already quoted, <q>For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from them?</q> It is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, God says, to harbour <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts; yet I have allowed them to do so. It is still more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to carry them out; yet in My mercy and kindness I have permitted even this. But should the sinful thought have become the sinful deed? Should men in their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> have trampled thus on my tenderness? Nevertheless <q>I have no pleasure in the death of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> turn from his way and live;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303968"><a href="../bible/eze033.htm#verse11">Ezekiel&nbsp;33:11</a></span> and as it is not they that are whole who need a physician but they that are sick, <span class="stiki" id="note303969"><a href="../bible/luk005.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;5:31</a></span> even after his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> I hold out a hand to the prostrate sinner and exhort him, polluted as he is in his own blood, <span class="stiki" id="note303970"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse6">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:6</a></span> to wash away his stains with tears of penitence. But if even then he shows himself unwilling to repent, and if, after he has suffered shipwreck, he refuses to clutch the plank which alone can save him, I am compelled at last to say: <q>Thus says the Lord, For three transgressions and for four shall I not turn away from him?</q> For this <q>turning away</q> God accounts a punishment, inasmuch as the sinner is left to his own devices. It is thus that he visits the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation; <span class="stiki" id="note303971"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;20:5</a></span> not punishing those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> immediately but pardoning their first offenses and only passing sentence on them for their last. For if it were otherwise and if God were to stand forth on the moment as the avenger of iniquity, the church would lose many of its <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and certainly would be deprived of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel, from whom we have quoted above, repeating God's words spoken to himself speaks thus: <q>Open your mouth and eat what I shall give you. And behold,</q> he says, <q>an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein; and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and a song, and woe.</q>  The first of these three belongs to you if you prove willing, as a sinner, to repent of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The second belongs to those who are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, who are called upon to sing praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for praise does not become a sinner's mouth. And the third belongs to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> like you who in despair have given themselves over to uncleanness, to fornication, to the belly, and to the lowest <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; men who suppose that death ends all and that there is nothing beyond it; who say: <q>When the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303973"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;28:15</a></span> The book which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> eats is the whole series of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, which in turn bewail the penitent, celebrate the righteous, and curse the desperate. For nothing is so displeasing to God as an impenitent heart. Impenitence is the one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which there is no forgiveness. For if one who ceases to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is pardoned even after he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and if <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> has power to bend the judge; it follows that every impenitent sinner must provoke his judge to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. Thus despair is the one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which there is no remedy. By obstinate rejection of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> men turn His mercy into sternness and severity. Yet, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God does every day call sinners to repentance, hear Isaiah's words: <q>In that day,</q> he says, <q>did the Lord God of Hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth: and behold <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die.</q> After these words filled with the recklessness of despair the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> goes on to say: <q>And it was revealed in my ears by the Lord of Hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till you die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note303974"><a href="../bible/isa022.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;22:12-14</a></span> Only when they become dead to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, will their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be forgiven them. For, so long as they live in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it cannot be put away.</p>

<p>4. Have mercy I beseech you upon your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Consider that God's judgment will one day overtake you. Remember by what a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> you were ordained. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man was mistaken in his choice; but this he might well be. For even God repented that he had anointed Saul to be king. <span class="stiki" id="note303975"><a href="../bible/1sa015.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;15:11</a></span> Even among the twelve <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> Judas was found a traitor. And Nicolas of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> like yourself <span class="stiki" id="note303976"><a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;6:5</a></span> &mdash; disseminated the Nicolaitan <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and all manner of uncleanness. <span class="stiki" id="note303977"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;2:6,&nbsp;15</a></span> I do not now bring up to you the many <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> whom you are said to have seduced, or the noble matrons who have suffered death  because violated by you, or the greedy profligacy with which you have hied through dens of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For grave and serious as such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are in themselves, they are trivial indeed when compared with those which I have now to narrate. How great must be the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> beside which seduction and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> are insignificant? Miserable wretch that you are! When you enter the cave wherein the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was born, where <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sprang out of the earth and the land did yield her increase,  it is to make an assignation. Have you no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that the babe will cry from the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>, that the newly delivered virgin will see you, that the mother of the Lord will behold you? The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> cry aloud, the shepherds run, the star shines down from heaven, the wise men worship, <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> is terrified, Jerusalem is in confusion, and meantime you creep into a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> cell to seduce the virgin to whom it belongs. I am filled with consternation and a shiver runs through me, <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, when I try to set before your eyes the deed that you have done. The whole church was keeping vigil by night and proclaiming Christ as its Lord; in one spirit though in different tongues the praises of God were being sung. Yet you were squeezing your love-notes into the openings of what is now the altar, as it was once the <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>, of the Lord, choosing this place in order that your unhappy victim might find and read them when she came to kneel and worship there. Then you took your place among the singers, and with impudent nods communicated your passion to her.</p>

<p>5. Oh! crying shame! I can go no farther. For sobs anticipate my words, and indignation and grief choke me in the act of utterance. Oh! For the sea of Tully's eloquence! Oh! For the impetuous current of the invective of Demosthenes! Yet in this case I am sure you would both be dumb; your eloquence would fail you. A deed has been disclosed which no rhetoric can explain; a crime has been discovered which no mime can represent, nor jester play, nor comedian describe. </p>

<p>It is usual in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> who have vowed themselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and have renounced the world and have trodden under foot its pleasures, to ask the mothers of their communities to cut their hair; not that afterwards they go about with heads uncovered in defiance of the apostle's command, <span class="stiki" id="note303981"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:5-6</a></span> for they wear a close-fitting cap and a veil. No one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> of this in any single case except the shearers and the shorn, but as the practice is universal, it is almost universally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. The custom has in fact become a second nature. It is designed to save those who take no baths and whose heads and faces are strangers to all ointments, from accumulated dirt and from the tiny creatures which are sometimes generated about the roots of the hair.</p>

<p>6. Let us see then, my good friend, how you acted in these surroundings. You promised to marry your unhappy victim; and then in that venerable cave you took from her, either as securities for her fidelity or as a pledge of the engagement, some locks of hair, some handkerchiefs, and a girdle, swearing at the same time that you would never <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> another as you loved her. Then you ran to the place where the shepherds were watching their flocks when they heard the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> singing over head, and there again you plighted your troth. I say no more; I do not accuse you of kissing her or of embracing her. Although I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is nothing of which you are not capable, still the sacred character of stable and field forbids me to suppose you guilty except in will and determination. Unhappy man! When you first stood beside the virgin in the cave, surely a mist must have dimmed your eyes, your tongue must have been paralysed, your arms must have fallen to your sides, your chest must have heaved, your gait must have become unsteady. She had assumed the bridal-veil of Christ in the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> and had vowed to live henceforth in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, in the spots <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the Lord's Cross, His Resurrection, and His Ascension; and yet after all this you dared to accept that hair, which at Christ's command she had cut off in the cave of His birth, as a token of her readiness to sleep with you. Again you used to sit beneath her window from the evening till the morning; and because owing to its height you could not come to close quarters with her, you conveyed things to her and she in her turn to you by the aid of a cord. How careful the lady superior must have been is shown by the fact that you never saw the virgin except in church; and that, although both of you had the same inclination, you could find no means of conversing with each other except at a window under cover of night. As I was afterwards told you used to be quite sorry when the sun rose. Your face looked bloodless, shrunken, and pale; and to remove all suspicion, you used to be for ever reading Christ's gospel as if you were a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> indeed.  I and others used to attribute your paleness to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and to admire your bloodless lips&mdash; so unlike the brilliant colour which they generally showed&mdash; in the belief that they were caused by frequent <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a>. You were already preparing ladders to fetch the unhappy virgin from her cell; you had already arranged your route, ordered vessels, settled a day, and thought out the details of your flight, when, behold, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who kept the door of Mary's chamber, who watched over the cradle of the Lord and who bore in his arms the infant Christ, in whose presence you had committed these great <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, himself and none other, betrayed you.</p>

<p>7. Oh! My unlucky eyes! Oh! Day worthy of the most solemn curse, on which with utter consternation I read your letters, the contents of which I am forced to remember still! What obscenities they contained! What blandishments! What exultant triumph in the prospect of the virgin's dishonour. A <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> should not have even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> such things, much less should he have spoken of them. Unhappy man! Where can you have learned them, you who used to boast that you had been reared in the church. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, however, that in these letters you <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> that you have never led a chaste life and that you are not really a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>. If you try to disown them your own handwriting will convict you, and the very letters will cry out against you. But meantime you may make what you can of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for what you have written is so foul that I cannot bring it up as evidence against you.</p>

<p>8. You threw yourself down at my knees, you prostrated yourself, you begged me&mdash; I use your own words&mdash; to spare <q>your half-pint of blood.</q> Oh! Miserable wretch! You thought nothing of God's judgment, and feared no vengeance but mine. I forgave you, I admit; what else being a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> could I do? I urged you to repent, to wear sackcloth, to roll in ashes, to seek seclusion, to live in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, to implore God's mercy with constant tears. You however showed yourself a pillar of confidence, and excited as you were by the viper's sting you became to me a deceitful bow; you shot at me arrows of reviling. I have become your enemy because I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note303983"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> I do not complain of your <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>; everyone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that you only praise men as <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> as yourself. What I lament is that you do not lament yourself, that you do not realize that you are dead, that, like a gladiator ready for Libitina,  you deck yourself out for your own funeral. You wear not sackcloth but linen, you load your fingers with rings, you use toothpowder for your teeth, you arrange the stray hairs on your brown skull to the best advantage. Your bull's neck bulges out with fat and droops no whit because it has given way to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Moreover you are redolent of perfume, you go from one bath to another, you wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>  against the hair that grows in spite of you, you walk through the forum and the streets a spruce and smooth-faced rake. Your face has become the face of a harlot: you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to blush. <span class="stiki" id="note303986"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:3</a></span> Return, unhappy man, to the Lord, and He will return to you. <span class="stiki" id="note303987"><a href="../bible/mal003.htm#verse7">Malachi&nbsp;3:7</a></span> Repent, and He will repent of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that He has purposed to bring upon you.</p>

<p>9. Why is it that you disregard your own scars and try to defame others? Why is it that when I give you the best advice you attack me like a madman? It may be that I am as <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> as you publicly proclaim; in that case you can at least repent as heartily as I do. It may be that I am as great a sinner as you make me out; if so, you can at least imitate a sinner's tears. Are my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>? Or does it alleviate your misery that many are in the same plight as yourself? Let a few tears fall on the silk and fine linen which make you so resplendent. Realize that you are naked, torn, unclean, a beggar. <span class="stiki" id="note303988"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse17">Revelation&nbsp;3:17</a></span> It is never too late to repent.  You may have gone down from Jerusalem and may have been wounded on the way; yet the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> will set you upon his beast, and will bring you to the inn and will take care of you. <span class="stiki" id="note303990"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;10:30-34</a></span> Even if you are lying in your grave, the Lord will raise you though your flesh may stink. <span class="stiki" id="note303991"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse39">John&nbsp;11:39,&nbsp;44</a></span> At least imitate those blind men for whose sake the Saviour left His home and heritage and came to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>. They were sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death when the light shone upon them. <span class="stiki" id="note303992"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse79">Luke&nbsp;1:79</a></span> For when they learned that it was the Lord who was passing by they began to cry out saying: <q>Thou Son of David, have mercy on us.</q>  You too will have your sight restored; if you cry to Him, and cast away your filthy garments at His call. <span class="stiki" id="note303994"><a href="../bible/mar010.htm#verse50">Mark&nbsp;10:50</a></span> <q>When you shall turn and bewail yourself then shall you be saved, and then shall you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> where you have hitherto been.</q>  Let Him but touch your scars and pass his hands over your eyeballs; and although you may have been born blind from the womb and although your mother may have conceived you in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he will purge you with <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a> and you shall be clean, he will wash you and you shall be whiter than snow.  Why is it that you are bowed together and bent down to the ground, why is it that you are still prostrate in the mire? She whom <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> had bound for eighteen years came to the Saviour; and being cured by Him was made straight so that she could once more look up towards heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note303997"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;13:11-13</a></span> God says to you what He said to Cain: <q> You have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>: hold your peace.</q>  Why do you flee from the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and dwell in the land of Nod? Why do you struggle in the waves  when you can plant your feet upon the rock? See to it that Phinehas does not thrust you through with his spear while you are committing fornication with the Midianitish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note304000"><a href="../bible/num025.htm#verse6">Numbers&nbsp;25:6-8</a></span> Amnon did not spare Tamar, <span class="stiki" id="note304001"><a href="../bible/2sa013.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;13:14</a></span> and you her brother and kinsman in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> have had no mercy upon this virgin. But why is it that when you have defiled her you change into an Absalom and desire to kill a David who mourns over your rebellion and spiritual death? The blood of Naboth <span class="stiki" id="note304002"><a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;21:13</a></span> cries out against you. The vineyard also of Jezreel, that is, of God's seed, demands due vengeance upon you, seeing that you have turned it into a garden of pleasures and made it a seed-bed of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. God sends you an Elijah to tell you of torment and of death. Bow yourself down therefore and put on sackcloth for a little while; then perhaps the Lord will say of you what He said of Ahab: <q>Do you see how Ahab <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself before me? Because he <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself before me, <span class="stiki" id="note304003"><a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;21:29</a></span> I will not bring the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in his days.</q></p>

<p>10. But possibly you flatter yourself that since the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has made you a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, his merits will atone for your transgressions. I have already told you that the father is not punished for the son nor the son for the father. <q>The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it shall die.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note304004"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse4">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:4</a></span> Samuel too had sons who forsook the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord and <q>turned aside after lucre</q> and iniquity. <span class="stiki" id="note304005"><a href="../bible/1sa008.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;8:3</a></span> Eli also was a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, but he had sons of whom we read in the Hebrew that they lay with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that like you they shamelessly claimed for themselves the right to minister in His sanctuary.  Wherefore the tabernacle itself was overthrown and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place made desolate by reason of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who were God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And even Eli himself offended God by showing too great leniency to his sons; therefore, so far from the righteousness of your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> being able to deliver you, it is rather to be feared that your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> may hurl him from his seat and that falling on his back like Eli he may perish irretrievably. <span class="stiki" id="note304007"><a href="../bible/1sa004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;4:18</a></span> If the Levite Uzzah was smitten merely because he tried to hold up from falling the ark which it was his special province to carry; <span class="stiki" id="note304008"><a href="../bible/2sa006.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;6:6-7</a></span> what punishment, think you, will be inflicted upon you who have tried to overthrow the Lord's ark when standing firm? The more estimable the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is who ordained you, the more detestable are you who have disappointed the expectations of so good a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. His long <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of your misdoings is indeed easy to account for; as it generally happens that we are the last to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the scandals which affect our homes, and are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of our children and wives even when our neighbors talk of nothing else. At all events all <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> was aware of your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life; and it was everywhere a subject of lamentation that you should still stand before the altar of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For you had neither the cunning nor the forethought to conceal your <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>. So hot were you, so lecherous, and so wanton, so entirely under the sway of this and that caprice of self-indulgence, that, not content with satisfying your <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, you gloried in each intrigue as a triumph and emerged from it bearing palms of victory.</p>

<p>11. Once more the fire of unchastity seized you, this time among savage swords and in the quarters of a married barbarian of great influence and power. You were not afraid to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> in a house where the injured husband might have punished you without calling in a judge's aid. You found yourself attracted and drawn to suburban parks and gardens; and, in the husband's absence behaved as boldly and madly as if you supposed your companion to be not your paramour but your wife. She was at last captured, but you escaped through an underground passage and secretly made your way to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. There you hid yourself among some Samnite <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>; and on the first hint that the aggrieved husband was coming down from the Alps like a new Hannibal in search of you, you did not think yourself safe till you had taken refuge on shipboard. So hasty indeed was your flight that you chose to face a tempest at sea rather than take the consequences of remaining on shore. Somehow or other you reached <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and on arriving there professed a wish to go on to Jerusalem and there to serve the Lord. Who could refuse to welcome one who declared himself to be a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; especially if he were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of your tragical career and had read the letters of commendation which your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had addressed to other prelates?  Unhappy man! You transformed yourself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light; <span class="stiki" id="note304010"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14-15</a></span> and while you were in reality a minister of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, you pretended to be a minister of righteousness. You were only a wolf in sheep's clothing; <span class="stiki" id="note304011"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> and having played the adulterer once towards the wife of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, you desired now to play the adulterer to the spouse of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. </p>

<p>12. My design in recounting these events has been to sketch for you the picture of your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life and to set your misdeeds plainly before your eyes. I have wished to prevent you from making God's mercy and His abundant tenderness an excuse for committing new <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and to save you from crucifying to yourself the son of God afresh and putting Him to an open shame. For you may do these things if you do not read the words which follow the passage to which I have alluded. They are these: <q>The earth which drinks in the rain that comes oft upon it, and brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessings from God: but that which bears thorns and briers is rejected and is near unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.</q> </p>
