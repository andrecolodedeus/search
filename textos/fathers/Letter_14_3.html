<h1>Letter 14</h1>

<p><strong>To Heliodorus, Monk</strong></p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>Heliodorus, originally a soldier, but now a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, had accompanied Jerome to the East, but, not feeling called to the solitary life of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, had returned to Aquileia. Here he resumed his clerical duties, and in course of time was raised to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Altinum.</p>
<p>The letter was written in the first bitterness of separation and reproaches Heliodorus for having gone back from the perfect way of the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life. The description given of this is highly colored and seems to have produced a great impression in the West. Fabiola was so much enchanted by it that she learned the letter by heart.  The date is 373 or 374 A.D.</p></div>

<p>1. So conscious are you of the affection which exists between us that you cannot but recognize the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and passion with which I strove to prolong our common sojourn in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. This very letter&mdash; blotted, as you see, with tears&mdash; gives evidence of the lamentation and weeping with which I accompanied your departure. With the pretty ways of a child you then softened your refusal by soothing words, and I, being off my guard, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what to do. Was I to hold my peace? I could not conceal my eagerness by a show of indifference. Or was I to entreat you yet more earnestly? You would have refused to listen, for your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was not like mine. Despised affection has taken the one course open to it. Unable to keep you when present, it goes in search of you when absent. You asked me yourself, when you were going away, to invite you to the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> when I took up my quarters there, and I for my part promised to do so. Accordingly I invite you now; come, and come quickly. Do not call to mind old ties; the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> is for those who have left all. Nor let the hardships of our former travels deter you. You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in His words: <q>Seek ye first the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all these things shall be added unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300175"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;6:33</a></span> Take neither scrip nor staff. He is rich enough who is poor&mdash; with Christ.</p>

<p>2. But what is this, and why do I foolishly importune you again? Away with entreaties, an end to coaxing words. Offended <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> does well to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. You have spurned my petition; perhaps you will listen to my remonstrance. What keeps you, effeminate soldier, in your father's house? Where are your ramparts and trenches? When have you spent a winter in the field? Lo, the trumpet sounds from heaven! Lo, the Leader comes with clouds! <span class="stiki" id="note300176"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse7">Revelation&nbsp;1:7</a></span> He is armed to subdue the world, and out of His mouth proceeds a two-edged sword <span class="stiki" id="note300177"><a href="../bible/rev001.htm#verse16">Revelation&nbsp;1:16</a></span> to mow down all that encounters it. But as for you, what will you do? Pass straight from your chamber to the battlefield, and from the cool shade into the burning sun? Nay, a body used to a tunic cannot endure a buckler; a head that has worn a cap refuses a helmet; a hand made tender by disuse is galled by a sword-hilt.  Hear the proclamation of your King: <q>He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300179"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> Remember the day on which you enlisted, when, buried with Christ in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, you swore fealty to Him, declaring that for His sake you would spare neither father nor mother. Lo, the enemy is striving to slay Christ in your breast. Lo, the ranks of the foe sigh over that bounty which you received when you entered His service. Should your little nephew  hang on your neck, pay no regard to him; should your mother with ashes on her hair and garments rent show you the breasts at which she nursed you, heed her not; should your father prostrate himself on the threshold, trample him under foot and go your way. With dry eyes fly to the standard of the cross. In such cases cruelty is the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> affection.</p>

<p>3. Hereafter there shall come&mdash; yes, there shall come&mdash; a day when you will return a victor to your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> country, and will walk through the heavenly Jerusalem crowned with the crown of valor. Then will you receive the citizenship thereof with <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.  Then will you seek the like privilege for your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. Then will you intercede for me who have urged you forward on the path of victory.</p>

<p>I am not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the fetters which you may plead as hindrances. My breast is not of iron nor my heart of stone. I was not born of flint or suckled by a tigress.  I have passed through troubles like yours myself. Now it is a widowed sister who throws her caressing arms around you. Now it is the slaves, your foster-brothers, who cry, <q>To what master are you leaving us?</q> Now it is a nurse bowed with age, and a body-servant loved only less than a father, who exclaim: <q>Only wait till we die and follow us to our graves.</q> Perhaps, too, an aged mother, with sunken bosom and furrowed brow, recalling the lullaby  with which she once soothed you, adds her entreaties to theirs. The learned may call you, if they please,</p>

<blockquote><p>The sole support and pillar of your house. </p></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> will easily break such bonds.</p>

<p>Scripture, you will argue, bids us <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300185"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse1">Ephesians&nbsp;6:1</a></span> Yes, but whoso loves them more than Christ loses his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300186"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;10:37</a></span> The enemy takes sword in hand to slay me, and shall I think of a mother's tears? Or shall I desert the service of Christ for the sake of a father to whom, if I am Christ's servant, I owe no <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of burial, <span class="stiki" id="note300187"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse59">Luke&nbsp;9:59-60</a></span> albeit if I am Christ's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servant I owe these to all? Peter with his cowardly advice was an offense to the Lord on the eve of His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note300188"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;16:23</a></span> and to the brethren  who strove to restrain him from going up to Jerusalem, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> one answer was: <q>What mean ye to weep and to break my heart? For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300189"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;21:13</a></span> The battering-ram of natural affection which so often shatters <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must recoil powerless from the wall of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <q>My mother and my brethren are these whosoever do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of my Father which is in heaven.</q>  If they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ let them bid me God-speed, for I go to fight in His name. And if they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, <q>let the dead bury their dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300191"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;8:22</a></span> </p>

<p>4. But all this, you argue, only touches the case of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Ah! My brother, you are mistaken, you are mistaken, if you suppose that there is ever a time when the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> does not suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Then are you most hardly beset when you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that you are beset at all. <q>Our adversary as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300192"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> and do you think of peace? <q>He sits in the lurking-places of the villages: in the secret places does he <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> the innocent; his eyes are privily set against the poor. He lies in wait secretly as a lion in his den; he lies in wait to catch the poor;</q>  and do you slumber under a shady tree, so as to fall an easy prey? On one side self-indulgence presses me hard; on another <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> strives to make an inroad; my belly wishes to be a God to me, in place of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> would fain drive away the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> that dwells in me and defile His temple. <span class="stiki" id="note300195"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> I am pursued, I say, by an enemy</p>

<blockquote><p>
Whose name is Legion and his wiles untold; 
<br>and, hapless wretch that I am, how shall I hold myself a victor when I am being led away a captive?</p></blockquote>

<p>5. My dear brother, weigh well the various forms of transgression, and think not that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which I have mentioned are less flagrant than that of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Nay, hear the apostle's view of the matter. <q>For this ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>,</q> he writes, <q>that no whore-monger or unclean person, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300197"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> In a general way all that is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> savors of enmity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and what is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, since all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> are subject to him. Yet <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> elsewhere lays down the law in express and unmistakable terms, saying: <q>Mortify your members, which are upon the earth, laying aside fornication, uncleanness, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscence and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which are  <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, for which things' sake the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God comes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300199"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5-6</a></span> </p>

<p>Idolatry is not confined to casting <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> upon an altar with finger and thumb, or to pouring libations of wine out of a cup into a bowl. Covetousness is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, or else the selling of the Lord for thirty pieces of silver was a righteous act. <span class="stiki" id="note300200"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;26:15</a></span> Lust involves profanation, or else men may defile with common harlots  those members of Christ which should be <q>a living <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300202"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;12:1</a></span> Fraud is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, or else they are worthy of imitation who, in the Acts of the Apostles, sold their inheritance, and because they kept back part of the price, perished by an instant doom.  Consider well, my brother; nothing is yours to keep. <q>Whosoever he be of you,</q> the Lord says, <q>that forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300204"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;14:33</a></span> Why are you such a half-hearted <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>?</p>

<p>6. See how Peter left his net; <span class="stiki" id="note300205"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;4:18-20</a></span> see how the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> rose from the receipt of custom. <span class="stiki" id="note300206"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;9:9</a></span> In a moment he became an apostle. <q>The <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> has not where to lay his head,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300207"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;8:20</a></span> and do you plan wide porticos and spacious halls? If you look to inherit the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the world you can no longer be a joint-heir with Christ. <span class="stiki" id="note300208"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;8:17</a></span> You are called a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and has the name no meaning? What brings you, a solitary, into the throng of men? The advice that I give is that of no inexperienced mariner who has never lost either ship or cargo, and has never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> a gale. Lately shipwrecked as I have been myself, my warnings to other voyagers spring from my own fears. On one side, like Charybdis, self-indulgence sucks into its vortex the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. On the other, like Scylla, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, with a smile on her girl's face, lures it on to wreck its <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. The coast is savage, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with a crew of pirates carries irons to fetter his captives. Be not credulous, be not over-confident. The sea may be as smooth and smiling as a pond, its quiet surface may be scarcely ruffled by a breath of air, yet sometimes its waves are as high as mountains. There is danger in its depths, the foe is lurking there. Ease your sheets, spread your sails, fasten the cross as an ensign on your prow. The calm that you speak of is itself a tempest. <q>Why so?</q> you will perhaps argue; <q>are not all my fellow-townsmen <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>?</q> Your case, I reply, is not that of others. Listen to the words of the Lord: <q>If you will be perfect go and sell that you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and come and follow me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300209"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> You have already promised to be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>. For when you forsook the army and made yourself an eunuch for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven's</a> sake, <span class="stiki" id="note300210"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> you did so that you might follow the perfect life. Now the perfect servant of Christ has nothing beside Christ. Or if he have anything beside Christ he is not perfect. And if he be not perfect when he has promised God to be so, his profession is a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>. But <q>the mouth that lies slays the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300211"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse11">Wisdom&nbsp;1:11</a></span> To conclude, then, if you are perfect you will not set your heart on your father's goods; and if you are not perfect you have deceived the Lord. The <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> thunders forth its divine warning: <q>You cannot serve two masters,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300212"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;16:13</a></span> and does any one dare to make Christ a liar by serving at once both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">Mammon</a>? Repeatedly does He proclaim, <q>If any one will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300213"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;9:23</a></span> If I load myself with gold can I think that I am following Christ? Surely not. <q>He that says he abides in Him ought himself also so to walk even as He walked.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300214"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:6</a></span> </p>

<p>7. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you will rejoin that you possess nothing. Why, then, if you are so well prepared for battle, do you not take the field? Perhaps you think that <em>you</em> can wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in your own country, although the Lord could do no signs in His? <span class="stiki" id="note300215"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse58">Matthew&nbsp;13:58</a></span> Why not? You ask. Take the answer which comes to you with his authority: <q>No <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is accepted in his own country.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300216"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse24">Luke&nbsp;4:24</a></span> But, you will say, I do not seek <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>; the approval of my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is enough for me. Neither did the Lord seek it; for when the multitudes would have made Him a king he fled from them. <span class="stiki" id="note300217"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;6:15</a></span> But where there is no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> there is contempt; and where there is contempt there is frequent rudeness; and where there is rudeness there is vexation; and where there is vexation there is no rest; and where there is no rest the mind is apt to be diverted from its purpose. Again, where, through restlessness, earnestness loses any of its force, it is lessened by what it loses, and that which is lessened cannot be called perfect. The upshot of all which is that a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> cannot be perfect in his own country. Now, not to aim at perfection is itself a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>8. Driven from this line of defence you will appeal to the example of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. These, you will say, remain in their cities, and yet they are surely above criticism. Far be it from me to censure the successors of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, who with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> words consecrate the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and who make us <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.  Having the keys of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, they judge men to some extent before the day of judgment, and guard the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the bride of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But, as I have before hinted, the case of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> is different from that of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> feed Christ's sheep; I as a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> am fed by them. They live of the altar: <span class="stiki" id="note300219"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:13-14</a></span> I, if I bring no gift to it, have the axe laid to my root as to that of a barren tree. <span class="stiki" id="note300220"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;3:10</a></span> Nor can I plead poverty as an excuse, for the Lord in the gospel has praised an aged <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> for casting into the treasury the last two coins that she had. <span class="stiki" id="note300221"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;21:1-4</a></span> I may not sit in the presence of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>;  he, if I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, may deliver me to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, <q>for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300223"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Under the old law he who disobeyed the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> was put outside the camp and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> by the people, or else he was beheaded and expiated his contempt with his blood. <span class="stiki" id="note300224"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse5">Deuteronomy&nbsp;17:5,&nbsp;12</a></span> But now the disobedient person is cut down with the spiritual sword, or he is expelled from the church and torn to pieces by ravening <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Should the entreaties of your brethren induce you to take orders, I shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that you are lifted up, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest you may be cast down. You will say: <q>If a man desire the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he desires a good work.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300225"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:1</a></span> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that; but you should add what follows: such an one <q>must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, chaste, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no striker but patient.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300226"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:2-3</a></span> After fully explaining the qualifications of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the apostle speaks of ministers of the third degree with equal care. <q>Likewise must the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> be grave,</q> he writes, <q>not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre, holding the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.

For while you, a <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> trader, keep a penny in your hands, you occupy the place of another who might double the money. Wherefore, as he who ministers well purchases to himself a good degree, <span class="stiki" id="note300230"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:13</a></span> so he who approaches the cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note300231"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:27</a></span> </p>

<p>9. Not all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> indeed. You consider Peter; mark Judas as well. You notice Stephen; look also on Nicolas, sentenced in the Apocalypse by the Lord's own lips, <span class="stiki" id="note300232"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;2:6</a></span> whose shameful imaginations gave rise to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11067a.htm">Nicolaitans</a>. <q>Let a man examine himself and so let him come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300233"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:28</a></span> For it is not <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank that makes a man a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. The centurion Cornelius was still a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> when he was cleansed by the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Daniel was but a child when he judged the elders.  Amos was stripping mulberry bushes when, in a moment, he was made a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300235"><a href="../bible/amo007.htm#verse14">Amos&nbsp;7:14</a></span> David was only a shepherd when he was chosen to be king.  And the least of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> was the one whom Jesus loved the most. My brother, sit down in the lower room, that when one less <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> comes you may be bidden to go up higher. <span class="stiki" id="note300237"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;14:10</a></span> Upon whom does the Lord rest but upon him that is lowly and of a contrite spirit, and that trembles at His word? <span class="stiki" id="note300238"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;66:2</a></span> To whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has committed much, of him He will ask the more. <span class="stiki" id="note300239"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;12:48</a></span> <q>Mighty men shall be mightily tormented.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300240"><a href="../bible/wis006.htm#verse6">Wisdom&nbsp;6:6</a></span> No man need <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> himself in the day of judgment on merely physical <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, for then shall men give account for every idle word, <span class="stiki" id="note300241"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;12:36</a></span> and the reviling of a brother shall be counted as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300242"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;5:21-22</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> and Peter now reign with Christ, and it is not easy to take the place of the one or to hold the office of the other.

<p>10. At last my discourse is clear of the reefs: at last this frail bark has passed from the breakers into deep water. I may now spread my sails to the breeze; and, as I leave the rocks of controversy astern, my epilogue will be like the joyful shout of mariners. O desert, bright with the flowers of Christ! O solitude whence come the stones of which, in the Apocalypse, the city of the great king is built! <span class="stiki" id="note300247"><a href="../bible/rev021.htm#verse19">Revelation&nbsp;21:19-20</a></span> O wilderness, gladdened with God's special presence! What keeps you in the world, my brother, you who are above the world?  How long shall gloomy roofs oppress you? How long shall smoky cities immure you? Believe me, I have more light than you. Sweet it is to lay aside the weight of the body and to soar into the pure bright ether. Do you dread poverty? Christ calls the poor blessed. <span class="stiki" id="note300249"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;6:20</a></span> Does toil frighten you? No athlete is crowned but in the sweat of his brow. Are you anxious as regards food? Faith fears no famine. Do you dread the bare ground for limbs wasted with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>? The Lord lies there beside you. Do you recoil from an unwashed head and uncombed hair? Christ is your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> head.  Does the boundless solitude of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> terrify you? In the spirit you may walk always in paradise. Do but turn your thoughts there and you will be no more in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. Is your skin rough and scaly because you no longer bathe? He that is once washed in Christ needs not to wash again. <span class="stiki" id="note300251"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;13:10</a></span> To all your objections the apostle gives this one brief answer: <q>The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a></q> which shall come after them, <q>which shall be revealed in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300252"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;8:18</a></span> You are too greedy of enjoyment, my brother, if you wish to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with the world here, and to reign with Christ hereafter.</p>

<p>11. It shall come, it shall come, that day when this corruptible shall put on incorruption ,  and this mortal shall put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300253"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span> Then shall that servant be blessed whom the Lord shall find watching. <span class="stiki" id="note300254"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;24:46</a></span> Then at the sound of the trumpet <span class="stiki" id="note300255"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> the earth and its peoples shall tremble, but you shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. The world shall howl at the Lord who comes to judge it, and the tribes of the earth shall smite the breast. Once mighty kings shall tremble in their nakedness. Venus shall be exposed, and her son too. Jupiter with his fiery bolts will be brought to trial; and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, with his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, will be but a fool. Aristotle's arguments shall be of no avail. You may seem a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man and country bred, but then you shall exult and laugh, and say: Behold my crucified Lord, behold my judge. This is He who was once an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes and crying in a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300256"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;2:7</a></span> This is He whose <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> were a workingman and a working-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.  This is He, who, carried into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> in His mother's bosom, though He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fled before the face of man. This is He who was clothed in a scarlet robe and crowned with thorns. <span class="stiki" id="note300258"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;27:28-29</a></span> This is He who was called a sorcerer and a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300259"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;8:48</a></span> Jew, behold the hands which you nailed to the cross. Roman, behold the side which you pierced with the spear. See both of you whether it was this body that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> stole secretly and by night. <span class="stiki" id="note300260"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse64">Matthew&nbsp;27:64</a></span> For this you profess to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>.</p>

<p>My brother, it is affection which has urged me to speak thus; that you who now find the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> life so hard may have your reward in that day.</p>
