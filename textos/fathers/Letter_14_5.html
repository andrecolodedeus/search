<h1>Letter 14</h1>

<p>Leo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the City of Rome, to Anastasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Thessalonica.</p>

<h2>I. Prefatory.</h2>

<p>If with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reasoning you perceived all that has been committed to you, brother, by the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter's</a> authority, and what has also been entrusted to you by our favour, and would weigh it fairly, we should be able greatly to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> discharge of the responsibility imposed on you. </p>

<h2>II. Anastasius is taxed with exceeding the limits of his vicariate, especially in his violent and unworthy treatment of Atticus.</h2>

<p>Seeing that, as my predecessors acted towards yours, so too I, following their example, have delegated my authority to you , beloved: so that you, imitating our gentleness, might assist us in the care which we owe primarily to all the churches by Divine institution, and might to a certain extent make up for our personal presence in visiting those provinces which are far off from us: for it would be easy for you by regular and well-timed inspection to tell what and in what cases you could either, by your own influence, settle or reserve for our judgment. For as it was free for you to suspend the more important matters and the harder issues while you awaited our opinion, there was no reason nor necessity for you to go out of your way to decide what was beyond your powers. For you have numerous written warnings of ours in which we have often instructed you to be temperate in all your actions: that with loving exhortations you might provoke the churches of Christ committed to you to healthy <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. Because, although as a rule there exist among careless or <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> brethren things which demand a strong hand in rectifying them; yet the correction ought to be so applied as ever to keep <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> inviolate. Wherefore also it is that the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, in instructing Timothy upon the ruling of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, says: <q>an elder rebuke not, but intreat him as a father: the young men as brethren: old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as mothers: young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as sisters in all purity <span class="stiki" id="note360119"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:1-2</a></span> .</q> And if this moderation is due by the Apostle's precept to all and any of the lower members, how much more is it to be paid without offense to our brethren and fellow-<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>? In order that although things sometimes happen which have to be reprimanded in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, yet kindness may have more effect on those who are to be corrected than severity: exhortation than perturbation: <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than power. But they who <q>seek their own, not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s <span class="stiki" id="note360120"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;2:21</a></span>,</q> easily depart from this law, and finding pleasure rather in domineering over their subjects than in consulting their interests, are swoln with the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of their position, and thus what was provided to secure harmony ministers to mischief. That we are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to speak thus causes us no small grief. For I feel myself in a certain measure drawn into blame, on discovering you to have so immoderately departed from the rules handed down to you. If you were careless of your own <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, you ought at least to have spared my good name: lest what only your own mind prompted should seem done with our approval. Do but read, brother, our pages with care, and peruse all the letters sent by holders of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> to your predecessors, and you will find injunctions either from me or from my predecessors on that in which we learn you have presumed.</p>

<p>For there has come to us our brother Atticus, the metropolitan  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Old Epirus, with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his province, and with tearful pleading has complained of the undeserved contumely he has suffered, in the presence of your own <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> who, by giving no contradiction to these woeful complaints, showed that what was impressed upon us did not want for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. We read also in your letter, which those same <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of yours brought, that brother Atticus had come to Thessalonica, and that he had also sealed his agreement in a written profession, so that we could not but understand concerning him that it was of his own will and free devotion that he had come, and that he had composed the statement of his promise of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, although in the very mention of this statement a sign of injury was betrayed. For it was not necessary that he should be bound in writing, who was already proving his <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> by the very dutifulness of his <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> coming. Wherefore these words in your letter bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the bewailings of the aforesaid, and through his outspoken account that which had been passed over in silence is laid bare, namely that the Pr&aelig;fecture of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a> had been approached, and the most exalted functionary among the potentates of the world  had been set in motion to expose an innocent prelate: so that a company was sent to carry out the aweful deed who were to enlist all the public servants in giving effect to their orders, and from the church's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sanctuary charged with no crime, or at best a false one, was dragged a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, to whom no truce was granted in consideration of his grievous ill-health or the cruel winter weather: but he was forced to take a journey full of hardships and dangers through the pathless snows. And this was a task of such toil and peril that some of those who accompanied the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> are said to have succumbed. </p>

<p>I am quite dumb-founded, beloved brother, yea and I am also sore grieved that you brought yourself to be so savagely and violently moved against one about whom you had laid no further information than that when summoned to appear he put off and excused himself on the grounds of illness; especially when, even if he deserved any such treatment, you should have waited till I had replied to your consulting letter. But, as I perceive, you thought too well of my habits, and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> foresaw how fair-minded  an answer I was likely to make to preserve harmony among <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>: and therefore you made haste to carry out your movements without concealment, lest when you had received the letter of our forbearance dictating another course, you should have no licence to do that which is done. Or perhaps some crime had reached your ears, and metropolitan  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that you are, the weight of some new charge pressed you hard? But that this is not consistent with the fact, you yourself make certain by laying nothing against him. Yet even if he had committed some grave and intolerable misdemeanour, you should have waited for our opinion: so as to arrive at no decision by yourself until you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> our pleasure. For we made you our deputy, beloved, on the understanding that you were engaged to share our responsibility, not to take plenary powers on yourself. Wherefore as what you bestow a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> care on delights us much, so your wrongful acts grieve us sorely. And after experience in many cases we must show greater foresight, and use more diligent precaution: to the end that through the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace all matter of offense may be removed from the Lord's churches, which we have commended to you: the pre-eminence of your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishopric</a> being retained in the provinces, but all your usurping excesses being shorn off.</p>

<h2>III. The rights of the metropolitans under the vicariate of Anastasius are to be observed.</h2>

<p>Therefore according to the canons of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, which are framed by the spirit of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and hollowed by the whole world's reverence, we decree that the metropolitan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of each province over which your care, brother, extends by our delegacy, shall keep untouched the rights of their position which have been handed down to them from olden times: but on condition that they do not depart from the existing regulations by any carelessness or arrogance.</p>

<h2>IV. The negative qualifications of a bishop determined.</h2>

<p>In cities whose governors  have died let this form be observed in filling up their place: he, who is to be ordained, even though his good life be not attested, shall be not a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, not a <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a>, nor yet the husband of a second wife, or one who, though he has or has had but one, married a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. For the choosing of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> is of such surpassing importance that things which in other members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are not blame-worthy, are yet held unlawful in them.</p>

<h2>V. Continence is required even in sub-deacons.</h2>

<p>For although they who are not within the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are free to take pleasure in the companionship of wedlock and the procreation of children, yet for the exhibiting of the purity of complete continence, even <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a> are not allowed carnal marriage: that <q>both those that have, may be as though they had not ,</q> and those who have not, may remain single. But if in this order, which is the fourth from the Head , this is worthy to be observed, how much more is it to be kept in the first, or second, or third, lest any one be reckoned fit for either the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon's</a> duties or the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter's</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> position, or the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> pre-eminence, who is discovered not yet to have bridled his uxorious desires.</p>

<h2>VI. The election of a bishop must proceed by the wishes of the clergy and people.</h2>

<p>When therefore the choice of the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> is taken in hand, let him be preferred before all whom the unanimous consent of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people demands, but if the votes chance to be divided between two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, the judgment of the metropolitan should prefer him who is supported by the preponderance of votes and merits: only let no one be ordained against the express wishes of the place: lest a city should either despise or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom they did not choose, and lamentably fall away from religion because they have not been allowed to have whom they wished.</p>

<h2>VII. Metropolitans are to refer to their Vicar: the mode of electing metropolitans is laid down.</h2>

<p>However the metropolitan <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should refer to you, brother, about the person to be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and about the consent of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and people: and he should acquaint you with the wishes of the province: that the due celebration of the ordination may be strengthened by your authority also. But to right selections it will be your duty to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> no delay or hindrance, lest the Lord's flocks should remain too long with their shepherd's care.</p>

<p>Moreover when a metropolitan is defunct and another has to be elected in to his place, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the province must meet together in the metropolitical city: that after the wishes of all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> and all the citizens have been sifted, the best man may be chosen from the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> of that same church or from the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and you are to be informed of his name by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the province, who will carry out the wishes of his supporters on ascertaining that you agree with their choice.  For while we desire proper elections to be hampered by no delays, we yet allow nothing to be done presumptuously without your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</p>

<h2>VIII. Bishops are to hold provincial councils twice a year.</h2>

<p>Concerning councils of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> we give no other instructions than those laid down for the Church's health by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers : to wit that two meetings should be held a year, in which judgment should be passed upon all the complaints which are wont to arise between the various ranks of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if perchance among the rulers themselves a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> arise (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) concerning one of the greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, such as cannot be decided by a provincial trial, the metropolitan shall take care to inform you, brother, concerning the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the whole matter, and if, after both parties have come before you, the thing be not set at rest even by your judgment, whatever it be, let it be transferred to our jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>IX. Translation from one see to another is to be prohibited.</h2>

<p>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, despising the insignificance of his city, shall intrigue for the government of a more populous place, and transfer himself by whatever means to a larger flock, he shall first be driven from the chair he has usurped, and also shall be deprived of his own: so shall he preside neither over those whom in his greed he <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a>, nor over those whom in his arrogance he spurned. Therefore let each be content with his own bounds, and not seek to be raised above the limits of his present post.</p>

<h2>X. Bishops are not to entice or receive the clergy of another diocese.</h2>

<p>A <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> from another diocese let no (<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) accept or invite against the wishes of his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>: but only when giver and receiver agree together thereupon by friendly compact. For a man is guilty of a serious injury who ventures either to entice or withhold from a brother's church that which is of great use or high value. And so, if such a thing happen within the province, the metropolitan shall force the deserting <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> to return to his church: but if he has withdrawn himself still further off, he shall be recalled by your authoritative command: so that no occasion be left for either desire of gain or intrigue.</p>

<h2>XI. When the Vicar shall require a meeting of bishops, two from each province will be sufficient.</h2>

<p>In summoning <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to your presence, we wish you to show great forbearance: lest under a show of much diligence you seem to exult in your brethren's injuries. Wherefore if any greater case arise for which it is reasonable and necessary to convene a meeting of brethren, it may suffice, brother, that two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should attend from each province, whom the metropolitans shall think proper to be sent, on the understanding that those who answer the summons be not detained longer than fifteen days from the time fixed.</p>

<h2>XII. In case of difference of opinion between the Vicar and the bishops, the bishop of Rome must be consulted. The subordination of authorities in the Church expounded.</h2>

<p>But if in that which you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> necessary to be discussed and settled with the brethren, their opinion differs from your own wishes, let all be referred to us, with the minutes of your proceedings attested, that all ambiguities may be removed, and what is pleasing to God decided. For to this end we direct all our desires and pains, that what conduces to our harmonious unity and to the protection of discipline may be marred by no dissension and neglected by no slothfulness. Therefore, dearly beloved brother, you and those our brethren who are offended at your extravagant conduct (though the matter of complaint is not the same with all), we exhort and warn not to disturb by any wrangling what has been rightfully ordained and wisely settled. Let none <q>seek what is his own, but what is another's,</q> as the Apostle says: <q>Let each one of you please his neighbour for his good unto edifying. </q> For the cementing of our unity cannot be firm unless we be bound by the bond of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> into an inseparable solidity: because <q>as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office; so we being many are one body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and all of us members one of another. </q> The connection of the whole body makes all alike healthy, all alike beautiful: and this connection requires the unanimity indeed of the whole body, but it especially demands harmony among the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. And though they have a common dignity, yet they have not uniform rank; inasmuch as even among the blessed Apostles, notwithstanding the similarity of their <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> estate, there was a certain distinction of power, and while the election of them all was equal, yet it was given to one  to take the lead of the rest. From which model has arisen a distinction between <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also, and by an important ordinance it has been provided  that every one should not claim everything for himself: but that there should be in each province one whose opinion should have the priority among the brethren: and again that certain whose appointment is in the greater cities should undertake a fuller responsibility, through whom the care of the universal Church should converge towards Peter's one seat, and nothing anywhere should be separated from its Head. Let not him then who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> he has been set over certain others take it ill that some one has been set over him, but let him himself render the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> which he demands of them: and as he does not wish to bear a heavy load of baggage, so let him not dare to place on another's shoulders a weight that is insupportable. For we are <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and gentle Master who says: <q>Learn of Me, for I am gentle and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> of heart, and you shall find rest for your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For My yoke is easy and My burden light <span class="stiki" id="note360135"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;11:29-30</a></span> .</q> And how shall we experience this, unless this too comes to our remembrance which the same Lord says: <q>He that is greater among you, shall be your servant. But he that exalts himself, shall be humbled: and he that <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself, shall be exalted. </q></p>
