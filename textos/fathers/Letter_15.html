<h1>Letter 15</h1>

<p> <em>To Silvanus the Primate.</em> </p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in my words of consolation I am somewhat late, but it is not without reason that I have delayed to send them, for I have thought it worth while to let the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of your grief take its course. The cleverest physicians will never apply their remedies when a fever is at its height, but wait for a favourable opportunity for using the appliances of their skill. So after reckoning how sharp your anguish must be, I have let these few days go by, for if I myself was so distressed and filled with such sorrow by the news, what must not have been the sufferings of a husband and yoke-fellow, made, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, one flesh,  at the violent sundering of the union cemented both by time and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Such pangs are only natural; but let reason devise consolation by reminding you that humanity is frail and sorrow universal, and also of the hope of the resurrection and the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of Him who orders our lives wisely. We must needs accept the decrees of inestimable wisdom, and own them to be for our good; for they who reflect thus piously shall reap <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety's</a> rewards, and so delivered from immoderate lamentations shall pass their lives in peace. On the other hand they whom sorrow makes its slaves will gain nothing by their wailing, but will at once live weary lives and grieve the Guardian of us all. Receive then, my most honoured friend, a fatherly exhortation <q>The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. He has done whatsoever pleased Him. Blessed be the name of the Lord.</q> </p>
