<h1>Letter 150</h1>

<p> <em>Letter of Theodoretus, Bishop of Cyrus, to Joannes, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</em> </p>

<p>I have been much distressed at reading the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a> which you have sent to request me to refute in writing, and to make plain to all their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> sense. I have been distressed at the thought that one appointed to the shepherd's office, entrusted with the charge of so great a flock and appointed to heal the sick among his sheep, is both himself unsound, and that to a terrible degree, and is endeavouring to infect his lambs with his disease and treats the sheep of his folds with greater cruelty than that of wild beasts. They, indeed, tear and rend the sheep that are dispersed and separated from the flock; but he in its very midst, and while thought to be its saviour and its guardian introduces secret <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> among the victims of their confidence in him. Against an open assault it is possible to take precautions, but when an attack is made in the guise of friendship, its victim is found off his guard and hurt is easily done him. Hence foes who make <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> from within are far more dangerous than those who attack from without.</p>

<p>I am yet more grieved that it should be in the name of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion and with the dignity of a shepherd that he should give utterance to his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> words, and renew that vain and impious teaching of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> which was long ago stamped out. Besides all this there is the fact that he not only supports these views but even dares to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who decline to participate in his <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>&mdash;if he is really the author of these productions and they have not proceeded from some enemy of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> who has composed them in his name and, as the old story has it, flung the apple of discord  in the midst, and so fanned the flame on high.</p>

<p>But whether this composition comes from himself or from some other in his name, I, for my part, by the aid of the light of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in the investigation of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and corrupt opinion, according to the measure of the power given me, have refuted them as best I could. I have confronted them with the teaching of <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. I have exposed the monstrosity of the doctrine, and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> how vast is its divergence from divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. This I have done by comparing it with the words of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and pointing out what strange and jarring discord there is between it and the divine.</p>

<p>Against the hardihood of this <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>tizing, thus much I will say, that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the clear-voiced herald of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> those who had corrupted the evangelic and apostolic teaching and boldly did so against the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, not against those who abided by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> laid down by theologians; these he strengthened with blessings, saying, <q>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy and on the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Let then the author of these writings reap from the Apostle's curse the due rewards of his labours and the harvest of his seeds of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. We will abide in the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers.</p>

<p>To this letter I have appended my counter arguments, that on reading them you may judge whether I have effectively destroyed the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> propositions. Setting down each of the <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a> by itself, I have annexed the counter statement that readers may easily understand, and that the refutation of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> may be clear. </p>
