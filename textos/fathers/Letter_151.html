<h1>Letter 151</h1>

<p> <em>Letter or Address of Theodoret to the Monks of the Euphratensian, the Osrhoene, <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a>, and Cilicia.</em> </p>

<p>When I contemplate the condition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at the present crisis of affairs&mdash;the tempest which has recently beset the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> ship, the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> blasts, the beating of the waves, the deep darkness of the night, and, besides all this, the strife of the mariners, the struggle going on between oarsmen, the <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> of the pilots, and, lastly, the untimely action of the bad&mdash;I bethink me of the laments of Jeremiah and cry with him, <q>my bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart, my heart makes a noise in me,</q>  and to put away despondency's great cloud by the drops from my eyes, I have recourse to founts of tears. Amid a storm so wild it is fitting that the pilots be awake, to battle with the tempest, and take heed for the safety of the ship: the sailors ought to cease from their strife, and strive to undo the danger alike by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and skill: the mariners ought to keep the peace, and quarrel neither with one another nor with the pilots, but implore the Lord of the sea to banish the darkness by His rod. No one now is willing to do anything of the kind; and, just as happens in a night-engagement, we cannot recognise one another, we leave our enemies alone, and waste our weapons against our own side; we wound our comrades for foes, while all the while the bystanders laugh at our drunken folly, enjoy our disasters, and are delighted to see us engaged in mutual destruction. The responsibility for all this lies with those who have striven to corrupt the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and have dared to add a monstrous doctrine to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>; with them that have accepted the impious <q>Chapters</q> which they have sent forth with <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a> to the imperial city, and have confirmed them, as they have imagined, by their own signatures. But these <q>Chapters</q> have sprouted without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> from the sour root of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>; they are tainted with <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> and Eunomian <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; look into them carefully, and you will find that they are not clear of the impiety of Manes and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>. </p>

<p>In his very first chapter he rejects the dispensation  which has been made on our behalf, teaching that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> did not assume <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but was Himself changed into flesh, thus laying down that the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> took place not in reality but in semblance and seeming. This is the outcome of the impiety of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, Manes, and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>.</p>

<p>In his second and third chapters, as though quite oblivious of what he had stated in his preface, he brings in the hypostatic union, and a meeting by natural union, and by these terms he represents that a kind of mixture and confusion was effected of the divine nature and of the form of the servant. This comes of the innovation of the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>In his fourth chapter he denies the distinction of the terms of <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and refuses to allow, as the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Fathers has allowed, the terms of divine dignity to be understood of the divine nature, while the terms of humility, spoken in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense, are applied to the nature assumed; whence the rightminded can easily detect the kinship with impiety. For <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius, asserting the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to be a creature, and made out of the non-existent, and a servant, have ventured to apply to His godhead what is said in lowly and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sense; establishing by such means the difference of substance and the unlikeness.  Besides this, to be brief, he argues that the very impassible and immutable Godhead of the Christ suffered, and was crucified, dead, and buried. This goes beyond even the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius, for this pitch of impiety has not been reached even by them that dare to call the maker and creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> a creature. Furthermore he blasphemes against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, denying that It proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, in accordance with the word of the Lord, but maintaining that It has Its origin of the Son. Here we have the fruit of the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> seed; here we come near the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> husbandry of Macedonius. Such are the offspring of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a>, viler children of a vile father. This growth, which men, entrusted with the healing of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, ought to make abortive while yet in the womb, or destroy as soon as it is born, as dangerous and deadly to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, is cherished by these excellent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and promoted with great energy, alike to their own ruin and to that of all who will listen to them. We, on the contrary, earnestly desire to keep our heritage untouched; and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which we have received, and in which we have been ourselves <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> others, we strive to preserve uninjured and undefiled. We confess that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, was begotten of the Father before the ages, as touching the Godhead; and in the last days for us men and our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (was born) of the Virgin Mary; that the same Lord is of one substance with the Father as touching the Godhead, and of one substance with us as touching the manhood. For there was an union of two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. Wherefore we acknowledge one Christ, one Son, one Lord; but we do not destroy the union; we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it to have been made without confusion, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the word of the Lord to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <q>Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.</q>  If on the contrary there had been mixture and confusion, and one nature was made out of both, He ought to have said <q>Destroy me and in three days I shall be raised.</q> But now, to show that there is a distinction between God according to His nature, and the temple, and that both are one Christ, His words are <q>Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up,</q> clearly teaching that it was not God who was undergoing destruction, but the temple. The nature of this latter was susceptible of destruction, while the power of the former raised what was being destroyed. Furthermore it is in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> that we acknowledge the Christ to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. That <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is God is asserted by the blessed <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John <q>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. All things were made by Him and without Him was not anything made that was made.</q>  And again, <q>That was the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> light which lights every man that comes into the world.</q>  And the Lord Himself distinctly teaches us, <q>He that has seen me has seen the Father.</q>  And <q>I and my Father are one</q>  and <q>I am in the Father and the Father in me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note272165"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;10:38</a> transposed</span> and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> in his epistle to the Hebrews says <q>Who being the brightness of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power</q>  and in the epistle to the Philippians <q>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus; who being in the form of God thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with God but made Himself of no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> and took upon Him the form of a servant.</q>  And in the Epistle to the Romans, <q>Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q>  And in the epistle to Titus <q>Looking for that blessed hope and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> appearing of the great God and our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q>  And Isaiah exclaims <q>Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called, Angel of great counsel, Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, powerful, the Prince of Peace, the Father of the Age to come.</q>  And again <q>In chains they shall come over and they shall fall unto you. They shall make supplication unto you saying, surely God is in you and there is none else, there is no God. Verily you are a God that hidest yourself, O God of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the Saviour.</q>  The name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, however, indicates both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, for it is interpreted in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> to mean <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us,</q>  that is to say <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in man,</q> God in our nature. And the divine Jeremiah too utters the prediction <q>This is our God and there shall none other be accounted of in comparison with him. He has found out all the way of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and has given it unto Jacob His servant and to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> His beloved and afterward did He show Himself upon earth and conversed with men.</q>  And countless other passages might be found as well in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> and in the writings of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as in the predictions of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, setting forth that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is very God.</p>

<p>That after the Incarnation He is spoken of as Man our Lord Himself teaches in His words to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <q>Why do you go about to kill me?</q> <q>A man that has told you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  And in the first Epistle to the Corinthians the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> writes <q>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead,</q>  and to show of whom he is speaking he explains his words and says, <q>For as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</q>  And writing to Timothy he says, <q>For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</q>  In the Acts in his speech at Athens <q>The times of this <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> God winked at; but now commands all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> everywhere to repent; because He has appointed a day in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom He has ordained, whereof He has given assurance unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in that He has raised him from the dead.</q>  And the blessed Peter preaching to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> says, <q>You men of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, hear these words <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus of Nazareth</a>, a man approved of God among you by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> and wonders and signs which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> did by Him in the midst of you,</q>  and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah when predicting the sufferings of the Lord Christ, whom but just before he had called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, calls man in the passage <q>A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.</q> <q>Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.</q>  I might have collected other consentient passages of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture and inserted them in my letter had I not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> you to be practised in the divine oracles as befits the man called <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the Psalms.  I now leave the collection of evidence to your own diligence and proceed with my subject.</p>

<p>We confess then that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is very God and very man. We do not divide the one Christ into two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> to be united without confusion. We shall thus be able without difficulty to refute even the manifold <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>: for many and various are the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of those who have rebelled against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as we shall proceed to point out. <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and Manes deny that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> assumed <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> and do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> was born of a Virgin. They say that God the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> Himself was fashioned in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and appeared as man rather in semblance than in reality.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a> admit the birth, but they deny the assumption of our nature and affirm that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> employed the Virgin as it were as a mere conduit.</p>

<p>Sabellius the Libyan, Photinus, Marcellus the Galatian, and <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a> say that a mere man was born of the Virgin, but openly deny that the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Christ was God.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius maintain that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> assumed only a body of the Virgin.</p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> adds to the body an unreasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as though the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> had taken place not for the sake of reasonable beings but of unreasonable, while the teaching of the Apostles is that perfect man was assumed by perfect <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the words <q>Who being in the form of God took the form of a servant;</q>  for <q>form</q> is put instead of <q>nature</q> and <q>substance</q> and indicates that having the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of God He took the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of a servant.</p>

<p>When therefore we are disputing with <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, Manes and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, the earliest inventors of impiety, we endeavour to prove from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> that the Lord Christ is not only God but also man.</p>

<p>When, however, we are proving to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Eunomius and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> about the &oelig;conomy is incomplete, we show from the divine oracles of the Spirit that the assumed nature was perfect.</p>

<p>The impiety of Sabellius, Photinus, Marcellus, and Paulus, we refute by proving by the evidence of <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> that the Lord Christ was not only man but also <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of one substance with the Father. That He assumed a reasonable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is stated by our Lord Himself in the words <q>Now is my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> troubled; and what shall I say? Father save me from this hour; but for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> came I unto this hour.</q>  And again <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful even unto death.</q>  And in another place <q>I have power to lay down my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (life A.V.) and I have power to take it again. No man takes it from me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note272185"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;10:18</a> varied</span> And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to Joseph, <q>Take the young child and His mother and go into the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; for they are dead which sought the young child's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (life A.V.)</q>  And the Evangelist says <q>Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> Now what increases in stature and wisdom is not the Godhead which is ever perfect, but the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> which comes into being in time, grows, and is made perfect.</p>

<p>Wherefore all the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> qualities of the Lord Christ, hunger, I mean, and thirst and weariness, sleep, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, sweat, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and the like, we affirm to belong to our nature which <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> assumed and united to Himself in effecting our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But the restitution of motion to the maimed, the resurrection of the dead, the supply of loaves, and all the other <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be works of the divine power. In this sense I say that the same Lord Christ both suffers and destroys suffering; suffers, that is, as touching the visible, and destroys suffering as touching the ineffably indwelling Godhead. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> beyond question by the narrative of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a>, from whom we learn that when lying in a manger and wrapped in swaddling clothes, He was announced by a star, worshipped by <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> and hymned by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Thus we reverent discern that the swaddling bands and the want of a bed and all the poverty belonged to the manhood; while the journey of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a> and the guiding of the star and the company of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> proclaim the Godhead of the unseen. In like manner He makes His escape into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and avoids the fury of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> by flight,  for He was man; but as the Prophet says <q>He shakes the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>,</q>  for He was by nature God. He is <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>; He keeps the law; and offers offerings of purification, because He sprang from the root of Jesse. And, as man, He was under the law; and afterwards did away with the law and gave the new covenant, because He was a lawgiver and had promised by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> that He Himself would give it. He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John; and this shows His sharing what is ours. He is testified to by the Father from on high and is pointed out by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>; this proclaims Him <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. He hungered; but He fed many thousands with five loaves; the latter is divine, the former <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. He thirsted and He asked for water; but He was the well of life; the former of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, the latter of His divine power. He fell asleep in the boat, but he put the tempest of the sea to sleep; the former of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, the latter of His efficient and creative power which has gifted all things with their being. He was weary as he walked; but He healed the halt and raised dead men from their tombs; the former of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, the latter of a power passing that of this world. He feared death and He destroyed death; the former shows that He was mortal, the latter that He was <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> or rather giver of life. <q>He was crucified,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> says <q>through weakness.</q>  But as the same <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says <q>Yet He lives by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  Let that word <q>weakness</q> teach us that He was not nailed to the tree as the Almighty, the Uncircumscribed, the Immutable and Invariable, but that the nature quickened by the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was according to the Apostle's teaching dead and buried, both death and burial being proper to the form of the servant. <q>He broke the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder</q>  and destroyed the power of death and in three days raised His own temple. These are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in accordance with the Lord's words <q>Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.</q>  Thus in the one Christ through the sufferings we contemplate the manhood and through the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> we apprehend the Godhead. We do not divide the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> into two Christs, and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that of the Father <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was begotten and that of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David our nature was assumed. Wherefore also the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> says when discoursing of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <q>He says not and to seeds as of many; but as of one, and to your seed which is Christ,</q>  and writing to Timothy he says <q>Remember that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> was raised from the dead according to my gospel.</q>  And to the Romans he writes <q>Concerning His son Jesus Christ...which was made of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> according to the flesh.</q>  And again <q>Whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came.</q>  And the Evangelist writes <q>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, the Son of David, the Son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,</q>  and the blessed Peter in the Acts says David <q>being a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that God had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to him that of the fruit of his loins, He would raise up Christ to sit on his throne, he seeing this before spoke of his resurrection,</q>  and God says to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <q>In your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,</q>  and Isaiah <q>There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of His roots; and there shall rest upon Him  the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and the spirit of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord shall fill Him.</q>  And a little further on <q>And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> seek; and His rest shall be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>.</q> </p>

<p>From these quotations it is made plain that according to the flesh, the Christ was descended from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David and was of the same nature as theirs; while according to the Godhead He is Everlasting Son and <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, ineffably and in superhuman manner begotten of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and co-eternal with Him as brightness and express image and Word. For as the word in relation to intelligence and brightness in relation to light are inseparably connected, so is the only begotten Son in relation to His own Father. We assert therefore that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is only begotten, and first born <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>; only begotten both before the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and after the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a> after being born of the Virgin. For the name <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> seems to be in a sense contrary to that of only begotten, because the only Son begotten of any one is called only begotten, while the eldest of several brothers is called <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>. The <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> state <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> alone to have been begotten of the Father; but the only begotten becomes also <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, by taking our nature of the Virgin, and deigning to call brothers those who have trusted in Him; so that the same is only begotten in that He is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, first born in that He is Man. Thus acknowledging the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> we adore the one Christ and offer Him one adoration, for we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the union took place from the moment of the conception in the Virgin's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> womb. Wherefore also we call the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin both <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>  and Mother of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, since the Lord Christ Himself is called <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>. The name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> proclaims the union of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>. If we acknowledge the Christ to be both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> and so call Him, who is so insensate as to shrink from using the term <q>Mother of man</q> with that of <q><a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a></q>? For we use both terms of the Lord Christ. For this reason the Virgin is honoured and called <q>full of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</q>  What sensible man then would object to name the Virgin in accordance with the titles of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, when on His account she is honoured by the faithful? For He who was born of her is not worshipped on her account, but she is honoured with the highest titles on account of Him Who was born from her.</p>

<p>Suppose the Christ to be God only, and to have taken the origin of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the Virgin, then let the Virgin be styled and named only <q><a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a></q> as having given birth to a being divine by nature. But if the Christ is both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> and was God from everlasting (inasmuch as He did not begin to exist, being co-eternal with the Father that begot Him) and in these last days was born man of His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, then let him who wishes to define doctrine in both directions devise appellations for the Virgin with the explanation which of them befits the nature and which the union. But if any one should wish to deliver a panegyric and to compose <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and to repeat praises, and is naturally anxious to use the most august names; then, not laying down doctrine as in the former case, but with rhetorical laudation, and expressing all possible admiration at the mightiness of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, let him gratify his heart's desire, let him employ high names, let him praise and let him wonder. Many instances of this kind are found in the writings of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> teachers. But on all occasions let moderation be respected. All praise to him who said that <q>moderation is best,</q> although he is not of our herd. </p>

<p>This is the confession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; this is the doctrine taught by <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> I will not refuse to undergo many deaths. This <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we have striven to convey to them that now <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> and stray, again and again challenging them to discussion, and eager to show them the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but without  success. With a suspicion of their probably plain confutation, they have shirked the encounter; for verily <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> is rotten and yokefellow of obscurity. <q>Every one,</q> it is written <q>that does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> comes not to the light lest his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> should be reproved</q>  by the light.</p>

<p>Since, therefore, after many efforts, I have failed in persuading them to recognise the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I have returned to my own churches, filled at once with sorrow and with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> on account of my own freedom from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and with sorrow at the unsoundness of my members. I therefore implore you to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with all your might to our loving Lord, and to cry unto Him, <q>'Spare Your people, O Lord and give not Your heritage to reproach.'  Feed us O Lord that we become not as we were in the beginning when You did not rule over us nor was Your name invoked to help us. 'We have become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us,'  because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> doctrines have come into Your inheritance. They have polluted Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> temple in that the daughters of strangers have rejoiced over our troubles. A little while ago we were of one mind and one tongue and now are divided into many tongues. But, O Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, give us Your peace which we have lost by setting Your commandments at naught. O Lord we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> none other than You. We call You by Your name. 'Make both one and break down the middle wall of the partition,'  namely the iniquity that has sprung up. Gather us one by one, Your new <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, building up Jerusalem and gathering together the outcasts of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.  Let us be made once more one flock  and all be fed by You; for You are the good Shepherd 'Who gives His life for the sheep '  'Awake, why sleepest Thou O Lord, arise, cast us not off forever.'  Rebuke the winds and the sea; give Your Church calm and safety from the waves.</q></p>

<p>These words and words like these I implore you to utter to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all; for He is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and full of loving-kindness and ever fulfils the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him. He will therefore listen to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and will scatter this darkness deeper than the plague of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. He will give you His own calm of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and will gather them that are scattered abroad and welcome them that have been cast out. Then shall be heard <q>the voice of rejoicing and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the tabernacles of the righteous.</q>  Then shall we cry unto Him we have been <q>glad according to the days wherein You have afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q>  and you when you have been granted your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> shall praise Him in the words <q>Blessed be God which not turned away my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> nor His mercy from me.</q> </p>

<h2>Proof that after the Incarnation our Lord Jesus Christ, was one Son.</h2>

<p>The authors of <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> against me allege that I divide the one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> into two sons. But so far am I from holding this opinion that I charge with impiety all who dare to say so. For I have been taught by the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> to worship one Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the only begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> incarnate. For we confess the same to be both God <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, and made man in the last days for the sake of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; but made man not by the change of the Godhead but by the assumption of the manhood. For the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this godhead is immutable and invariable, as is that of the Father who begot Him before the ages. And whatever would be understood of the substance of the Father will also be wholly found in the substance of the only begotten; for of that substance He is begotten. This our Lord taught when He said to Philip <q>He that has seen me has seen the Father</q>  and again in another place <q>All things that the Father has are mine,</q>  and elsewhere <q>I and the Father are one,</q>  and very many other passages may be quoted setting forth the identity of substance.</p>

<p>It follows that He did not become God: He was God. <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and the Word was God.</q>  He was not man: He became man, and He so became by taking on Him our nature: So says the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>&mdash; <q>Who being in the form of God thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but made Himself of no <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, and took upon Him the form of a servant.</q>  And again: <q>For verily He took not on Him the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; but He took on Him the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q>  And again; Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself likewise took part of the same.  Thus He was both passible and impassible; mortal and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; passible, on the one hand, and mortal, as man; impassible, on the other, and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. As God He raised His own flesh, which was dead&mdash;as His own words declare: <q>Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</q>  And as man, He was passible and mortal up to the time of the passion. For, after the resurrection, even as man He is impassible, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and incorruptible; and He discharges divine lightnings; not that according to the flesh He has been changed into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Godhead, but still preserving the distinctive marks of humanity. Nor yet is His body uncircumscribed, for this is peculiar to the divine nature alone, but it abides in its former circumscription. This He teaches in the words He spoke to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> even after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> <q>Behold my hands and feet that it is I myself; handle me and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me have.</q>  While He was thus beheld He went up into heaven; thus has He promised to come again, thus shall He be seen both by them that have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> and them that have crucified, for it is written <q>They shall look on Him whom they pierced.</q>  We therefore worship the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but we contemplate in Him either nature in its perfection, both that which took, and that which was taken; the one of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the other of David. For this reason also He is styled both Son of the living God and Son of David; either nature receiving its proper title. Accordingly the divine scripture calls him both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> exclaims <q>There is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus; who gave Himself a ransom for all.</q>  But Him whom here he calls man in another place he describes as God for he says <q>Looking for that blessed hope and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> appearing of the great God and our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</q>  And yet in another place he uses both names at once saying <q>Of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came who is over all God blessed for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q> </p>

<p>Thus he has stated the same Christ to be of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> according to the flesh, and God over all as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Similarly the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah writes <q>A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief....Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows,</q>  and shortly afterwards he says <q>Who shall declare His generation?</q>  This is spoken not of man but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus through Micah God says <q>Thou <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah, for out of you shall come a governor that shall rule my people <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, whose goings forth have been as of old from everlasting.</q>  Now by saying <q>From you shall come forth a ruler</q> he exhibits the &oelig;conomy of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>; and by adding <q>whose goings forth have been as of old from everlasting</q> he declares the Godhead begotten of the Father before the ages.</p>

<p>Since we have been thus taught by the divine scripture, and have further found that the teachers who have been at different periods illustrious in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are of the same opinion, we do our best to keep our heritage inviolate; worshipping one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; but at the same time recognising the distinction between flesh and Godhead. And as we assert them that divide our one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> into two sons to trangress from the road trodden by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, so do we declare the maintainers of the doctrine that the Godhead of the only begotten and the manhood have been made one nature to fall headlong into the opposite ravine. These doctrines we hold; these we preach; for these we do battle.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> of the libellers that represent me as worshipping two sons is refuted by the plain facts of the case. I teach all <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who come to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Baptism the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> put forth at Nic&aelig;a; and, when I celebrate the sacrament of regeneration I <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them that make profession of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, pronouncing each name by itself. And when I am performing divine service in the churches it is my wont to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Father and to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; not sons, but Son. If then I uphold two sons, whether of the two is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by me, and whether remains unhonoured? For I have not quite come to such a pitch of stupidity as to acknowledge two sons and leave one of them without any tribute of respect. It follows then even from this fact that the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>&mdash;for I worship one only begotten Son, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> incarnate. And I call the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin <q><a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a></q>  because she has given birth to the <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which means <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> with us.</q>  But the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> who predicted the <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a> a little further on has written of him that <q>Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulders; and his name is called Angel of great counsel, wonderful, counsellor, mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, powerful, Prince of peace, Father of the age to come.</q>  Now if the babe born of the Virgin is styled <q>Mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> then it is only with reason that the mother is called <q><a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mother of God</a>.</q> For the mother shares the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of her offspring, and the Virgin is both mother of the Lord Christ as man, and again is His servant as Lord and Creator and God.</p>

<p>On account of this difference of term He is said by the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be <q>without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life.</q>  He is without father as touching His humanity; for as man He was born of a mother alone. And He is without mother as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for He was begotten from everlasting of the Father alone. And again He is without descent as God while as man He has descent. For it is written <q>The book of the generation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> the son of David, the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</q>  His descent is also given by the divine Luke.  So again, as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He has no beginning of days for He was begotten before the ages; neither has He an end of life, for His nature is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> and impassible. But as man He had both a beginning of days, for He was born in the reign of Augustus C&aelig;sar, and an end of life, for He was crucified in the reign of <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius C&aelig;sar</a>. But now, as I have already said, even His <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>; and, as He ascended, so again shall He come according to the words of the Angel&mdash; <q>This same Jesus which is taken up from you into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> shall so come in like manner as you have seen Him go into <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>.</q> </p>

<p>This is the doctrine delivered to us by the divine <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; this is the doctrine of the company of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; this is the doctrine of the great <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> of the East and of the West; of the far-famed <a href="../cathen/07644a.htm">Ignatius</a>, who received his archpriesthood by the right hand of the great Peter, and for the sake of his confession of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was devoured by savage beasts;  and of the great Eustathius, who presided over the assembled council, and on account of his fiery <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion was driven into exile.  This doctrine was preached by the illustrious Meletius, at the cost of no less pains, for thrice was he driven from his flock in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> doctrines;  by Flavianus,  <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the imperial see; and by the admirable Ephraim, instrument of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, who has left us in the Syriac tongue a written heritage of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things;  by <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian</a>, the illustrious ruler of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> and of all Libya, who for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake found a death in the fire;  by Damasus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of great Rome,  and by Ambrose, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Milan, who preached and wrote it in the language of Rome. </p>

<p>The same was taught by the great luminaries of Alexandria, Alexander and Athanasius, men of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who underwent sufferings celebrated throughout the world. This was the pasture given to their flocks by the great teachers of the imperial city, by Gregory, shining friend and supporter of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; by John, teacher of the world, by Atticus, their successor alike in see and in sentiment.  By these doctrines Basil, great light of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and Gregory sprung from the same <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>,  and Amphilochius,  who from him received the gift of the high-<a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, taught their contemporaries, and have left the same to us in their writings for a goodly heritage. Time would fail me to tell of <a href="../cathen/12219b.htm">Polycarp</a>,  and <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>,  of Methodius  and Hippolytus,  and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/05075a.htm">teachers of the Church</a>. In a word I assert that I follow the divine oracles and at the same time all these <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. By the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the spirit they dived into the depths of God-inspired scripture and both themselves perceived its <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and made it plain to all that are willing to learn. Difference in tongue has wrought no difference in doctrine, for they were channels of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the divine spirit, using the stream from one and the same fount.</p>
