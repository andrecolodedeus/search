<h1>Letter 151 (A.D. 413 or 414)</h1>

<p> <em>To C&aelig;cilianus</em>,  <em>My Lord Justly Renowned, and Son Most Worthy of the Honour Due by Me to His Rank, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. The remonstrance which you have addressed to me in your letter is gratifying to me in proportion to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which it manifests. If, therefore, I attempt to clear myself from blame in regard to my silence, the thing which I must attempt is to show that you had no just <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for being displeased with me. But since nothing gives me greater pleasure than that you condescended to take offense at my silence, which I had supposed to be a matter of no moment in the midst of your many cares, I will be pleading against myself if I endeavour thus to clear myself from blame. For if you were wrong in being displeased at me for not writing to you, this must be because of your having such a poor opinion of me that you are absolutely indifferent whether I speak or remain silent. Nay, the displeasure which arises from your being distressed by my silence is not displeasure. I therefore feel not so much grief at my withholding, as <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at your desiring a communication from me. For it is an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, not a vexation, to me, that I should have a place in the remembrance of an old friend, and a man who is (though you may not say it, yet it is our duty to acknowledge it) of such eminent worth and greatness, holding a position in a foreign country, and burdened with public responsibilities. Pardon me, then, for expressing my gratitude that you did not regard me as a person whose silence it was beneath you to resent. For now I am persuaded, through that benevolence which distinguishes you more even than your high rank, that in the midst of your numerous and important occupations, not of a private nature, but public, involving the interests of all, a letter from me may be esteemed by you not burdensome, but welcome.</p>

<p>2. For when I had received the letter of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father Innocentius, venerable for his eminent merits, which was sent to me by the brethren, and which was, by manifest tokens, shown to have been forwarded to me from your Excellency,  I formed the opinion that the reason why no letter from you accompanied it was that, being engrossed with more important affairs, you were unwilling to be embarrassed by the trouble of correspondence. For it seemed certainly not unreasonable to expect, that when you condescended to send me the writings of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, I should receive along with them some writings of your own. I had therefore made up my mind not to trouble you with a letter from me unless it was necessary for the purpose of commending to you some one to whom I could not refuse the service of my intercession, a favour which it is our custom to grant to all&mdash;a custom which, though involving much trouble, is not to be altogether condemned. I accordingly did this recommending to your kindness a friend of mine, from whom I have now received a letter, expressing his thanks, to which I add my own, for your service.</p>

<p>3. If, however, I had formed any unfavourable impression concerning you, especially in regard to the matter of which, though it was not expressly named, a subtle odour, so to speak, pervaded your whole letter, far would it have been from me to write to you any such note in order to ask any favour for myself or another. In that case I would either have been silent, waiting for a time when I would have an opportunity of seeing you personally; or if I considered it my duty to write on the subject, I would have given it the first place in my letter, and would have treated it in such a way as to make it almost impossible for you to show displeasure. For when, notwithstanding remonstrances which, under an anxiety shared by you with us, we addressed to him&mdash;beseeching him vehemently, but in vain, to forbear from piercing our hearts with so great sorrow, and mortally wounding his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> by such grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;he  perpetrated his impious, savage, and perfidious crime, I left <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> immediately and secretly, for this reason, lest the numerous and influential <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who in terror sought refuge from his sword within the church should, imagining that my presence could be of use to them, detain me by their passionate weeping and groaning, so that I would be compelled, in order to secure the preservation of their bodies, to supplicate a favour from one whom it was impossible for me to rebuke in order to the welfare of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, with the severity which his crime deserved. As for their personal safety, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the walls of the church sufficed for their protection. But for myself [if I remained to intercede with him on their behalf], it could only be in circumstances painfully embarrassing, for he would not have tolerated my acting towards him as I was bound to do, and I would have been compelled, moreover, to act in a way which would have been unbecoming in me. At the same time, I was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> sorry for the misfortune of my venerable co-bishop, the ruler of such an important church, who was expected to regard it as his duty, even after this man had been guilty of such <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> treachery, to treat him with submissive deference, in order that the lives of others might be spared. I confess the reason of my departure: it was that I would have been unable to meet with the necessary <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> so great a calamity.</p>

<p>4. The same considerations which made me then depart would have been the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of my remaining silent to you, if I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> you to have used your influence with him to avenge such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> injuries. This is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in regard to you only by those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how, and how frequently, and in what terms, you expressed your mind to us, when we were with anxious solicitude doing our utmost to secure that, because he was so intimate with you, and you were so constantly visiting him, and so often conversing alone with him, he should all the more carefully guard your good name, and save you from being supposed to have used no endeavour to prevent him from inflicting that mode of death on <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> said to be your enemies. This, indeed, is not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> of you by me, nor by my brethren who heard you in conversation, and who saw, both in your words and in every gesture, the evidences of your heart's good-will to those who were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. But, I beseech you, forgive those by whom it is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>; for they are men, and in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> there are such lurking places and such depths that, although all suspicious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> deserved to be blamed, they think themselves that they even deserve praise for their <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. There <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> reasons for the conduct imputed to you: we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that you had suffered very grievous injury from one of those whom he had suddenly ordered to be arrested. His brother, also, in whose person especially he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was said to have answered you in terms implying as it were some harsh accusation. Both were thought to be looked upon by you with suspicion. When they, after being summoned, had gone away, you still remained in the place, and were engaged, it was said, in conversation of a more private kind than usual with him [Marinas], and then they were suddenly ordered to be detained. Men talked much of your friendship with him as not recent, but of long standing. The closeness of your intimacy, and the frequency of your private conversations with him, confirmed this report. His power was at that time great. The ease with which false accusations could be made against any one was notorious. It was not a difficult thing to find some person who would upon the promise of his own safety make any statements which he might order to be made. All things at that time made it easy for any man to be brought to death without any examination on the part of him who ordered the execution, if even one <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> brought forward what seemed to be an odious and, at the same time, credible accusation.</p>

<p>5. Meanwhile, as it was rumored that the power of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> might deliver them, we were mocked with false promises, so that not only with the consent, but, as it seemed, at the urgent desire of Marinus, a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was sent to the Imperial Court to intercede for them, the promise having been brought to the ear of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> that, until some pleading should be heard there on behalf of the prisoners, no examination of their case would be proceeded with. At last, on the day before they were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, your Excellency came to us; you gave us encouragement such as you had never before given, that he might grant their lives as a favour to you before your departure [for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>], because you had solemnly and prudently said to him that all his condescension in admitting you so constantly to familiar and private conversation would bring to you disgrace rather than distinction, and would have the effect, after the death of these men had been a subject of conversation and consultation between you, of making every one say that there could be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> what was to be the issue of these conferences. When you informed us that you had said these things to him, you stretched out your hand as you spoke towards the place at which the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are celebrated, and while we listened in amazement, you confirmed the statement that you had used these words with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> so solemn, that not only then, but even now after the dreadful and unexpected death of the prisoners, it seems to me, recalling to memory your whole demeanour, that it would be an aggravated insult if I were to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concerning you. You said, moreover, that he was so moved by these words of yours, that he purposed to give the lives of these men to you as a present, in token of friendship, before you set out on your journey.</p>

<p>6. Wherefore, I solemnly assure your Grace, that when on the following day (the day on which the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> crime thus conceived was consummated) tidings were unexpectedly brought to us that they had been led forth from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> to stand before him as their judge, although we were in some alarm, nevertheless, after reflecting on what you had said to us on the preceding day, and on the fact that the day following was the anniversary of the blessed Cyprian, I supposed that he had even purposely selected a day on which he might not only grant your request, but also might aspire, by giving sudden <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to emulate the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of so great a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, proving himself <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> greater in using clemency in sparing life than in possessing power to inflict death. Such were my thoughts, when lo! A messenger burst into our presence, from whom, before we could ask him how their trial was being conducted, we learned that they had been beheaded. For care had been taken to arrange, as the scene of execution, a place immediately adjoining, not appointed for the punishment of criminals, but used for the recreation of the citizens, on which spot he had ordered some to be executed a few days previously, with the design (as is with good reason <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>) of avoiding the odium of applying it to this purpose for the first time in the case of these men, whom he hoped to be able to snatch secretly from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> interposing on their behalf, by thus not only ordering their immediate execution, but also ordering it to take place on the nearest available spot. He therefore made it sufficiently manifest that he did not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> cruel pain to that Mother whose intervention he feared, namely, to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, among whose faithful children, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in her bosom, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he himself was reckoned. Therefore, after the issue of so great a plot, in which so much care had been used in negotiating with us that we were made, even by you also, though unwittingly, almost free from solicitude, and almost sure of their safety on the preceding day, who, judging of the circumstances in the way in which ordinary men would judge of them, could avoid regarding it as beyond question that by you also words were given to us and life taken from them? Pardon, then, as I have said, those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> these things against you, although we do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, O excellent man.</p>

<p>7. Far be it, however, from my heart and from my practice, however defective in many things, to intercede with you for any one, or ask a favour from you for any one, if I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> you to be responsible for this monstrous wrong, this villanous cruelty. But I frankly confess to you, that if you continue, even after that event, to be on the same footing of intimate friendship with him as you were formerly, you must excuse my claiming freedom to be grieved; for by this you would compel us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> much which we would rather disbelieve. It is, however, fitting that, as I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you guilty of the other things laid by some to your charge, I should not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this either. This friend of yours has, in the unexpected triumph of sudden accession to power, done <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> not less to your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> than to these men's lives. Nor is it my design in this statement to kindle <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> in your mind; in so doing I would belie my own feelings and profession. But I exhort you to a more faithful exercise of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards him. For the man who so deals with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> as to make them repent of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doings, is one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them, and yet consult for their good; for as bad companions hinder men's welfare by compliance, so good friends help them by opposition to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> ways. The same weapon with which, in the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> abuse of power, he took away the lives of others, inflicted a much deeper and more serious wound on his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and if he do not remedy this by repentance, using wisely the long-suffering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he will be compelled to find it out and feel it when this life is ended. Often, moreover, God in His wisdom permits the life of good men in this world to be taken from them by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, that He may prevent men from believing that to suffer such things is in their case a calamity. For what harm can result from the death of the body to men who are destined to die some time? Or what do those who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death accomplish by their care but a short postponement of the time at which they die? All the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to which mortal men are liable comes not from death but from life; and if in dying they have the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> sustained by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, death is to them not the night of darkness in which a good life ends, but the dawn in which a better life begins. </p>

<p>8. The life and conversation of the elder of the two brothers appeared indeed more conformed to this world than to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although he also had after his marriage corrected to a great extent the faults of his early irreligious years. It may, nevertheless, have been not otherwise than in mercy that our merciful God appointed him to be the companion of his brother in death. But as to that younger brother, he lived religiously, and was eminent as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> both in heart and in practice. The report that he would approve himself such when commissioned to serve the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>  came before him to Africa, and this good report followed him still when he had come. In his conduct, what innocence! In his friendship, what constancy! In his study of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, what <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>! In his religion, what sincerity! In his domestic life, what purity! In his official duties, what integrity! What patience be showed to enemies, what affability to friends, what humility to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, what charity to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>! How great his promptitude in granting, and his bashfulness in asking a favour! How genuine his satisfaction in the good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and his sorrow over the faults of men! What spotless <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, noble <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and scrupulous <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> shone in him! In rendering assistance, how compassionate he was! In forgiving injuries, how generous! In <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, how confiding! When well informed on any subject, with what modesty he was wont to communicate useful <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>! When conscious of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, with what diligence did he endeavour by investigation to overcome the disadvantage! How singular was his contempt for the things of time! How ardent his hope and his desires in regard to the blessings that are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>! He would have relinquished all secular business and girded himself with the insignia of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> warfare, had he not been prevented by his having entered into the married state; for he had not begun to desire better things before the time when, being already involved in these bonds, it would have been, notwithstanding their inferiority, an unlawful thing for him to rend them asunder.</p>

<p>9. One day when they were confined in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> together, his brother said to him: <q>If I suffer these things as the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, what ill desert has brought you to the same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your life was most strictly and earnestly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>?</q> He replied: <q>Supposing even that your testimony as to my life were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, do you think that God is bestowing a small favour upon me in appointing that my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be punished in these sufferings, even though they should end in death, instead of being reserved to meet me in the judgment which is to come?</q> These words might perhaps lead some to suppose that he was conscious of some secret immoralities. I shall therefore mention what it pleased the Lord God to appoint that I should hear from his lips, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> assuredly, to my own great consolation. Being anxious about this very thing, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> is liable to fall into such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, I asked him, when I was alone with him after he was confined in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, if there was no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which he ought to seek reconciliation with God  by some more severe and special penance. With characteristic modesty he blushed at the mere mention of my suspicion, groundless though it was, but thanked me most warmly for the warning, and with a grave, modest smile he seized with both hands my right hand, and said: <q>I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which are dispensed to me by this hand, that I have neither before nor since my marriage been guilty of immoral self-indulgence.</q> </p>

<p>10. What <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, then, was brought to him by death? Nay, rather, was it not the occasion of the greatest possible good to him, because, in the possession of these gifts, he departed from this life to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in whom alone they are really possessed? I would not mention these things in addressing you if I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that you would be offended by my praising him. But assuredly, as I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this, neither do I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that his being <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> was even according to your desire or wish, much less that it was done at your request. You, therefore, with a sincerity proportioned to your innocence in this matter, entertain, doubtless, along with us, the opinion that the man who put him to death inflicted more cruel wrong on his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than on the sufferer's body, when, in despite of us, in despite of his own promises, in despite of so many supplications and warnings from you, and finally, in despite of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> (and in her of Christ Himself), he consummated his base machinations by putting this man to death. Is the high position of the one worthy to be compared with the lot of the other, prisoner though he was, when the man of power was maddened by <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, while the sufferer in his <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> was filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? There is nothing in all the dungeons of this world, nay, not even in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> itself, to surpass the dreadful doom of darkness to which a villian is consigned by remorse of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. Even to yourself, what <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> did he do? He did not destroy your innocence, although he grievously injured your <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>; which, nevertheless, remains uninjured, both in the estimation of those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you better than we do, and in our estimation, in whose presence the anxiety which, like us, you felt for the prevention of such a monstrous crime, was expressed with so much visible agitation that we could almost see with our eyes the invisible workings of your heart. Whatever harm, therefore, he has done, he has done to himself alone; he has pierced through his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, his own life, his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; in fine, he has by that blind deed of cruelty destroyed even his own good name, a thing which the very worst of men are usually fain to preserve. For to all good men he is odious in proportion to his efforts to obtain, or his satisfaction in receiving, the approbation of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>.</p>

<p>11. Could anything prove more clearly that he was not under the necessity which he pretended&mdash; alleging that he did this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> action as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man who had no alternative&mdash; than the fact that the proceeding was disapproved of by the person whose orders he dared to plead as his excuse? The <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> by whose hand we send this was himself associated with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom we had sent to intercede for them; let him, therefore, relate to your Excellency how it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the Emperor not even to give a formal pardon, lest by this the stigma of a crime should be in some degree attached to them, but a mere notice commanding them to be immediately set at liberty from all further annoyance. By a purely gratuitous act of cruelty, and under no pressure of necessity (although, perchance, there may have been other causes which we suspect, but which it is unnecessary to state in writing), he did outrageously vex the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to whose sheltering bosom his brother once, in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of death, had fled, to be requited for protecting his life by finding him active in counselling the perpetration of this crime&mdash;the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which he himself had once, when under the displeasure of an offended patron, sought an asylum which could not be denied to him. If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> this man, show your detestation of his crime; if you do not wish him to come into everlasting punishment, shrink with horror from his society. You are bound to take measures of this kind, both for your own good name and for his life; for he who loves in this man what God <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>, is, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, hating not only this man but also his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>12. These things being so, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your benevolence too well to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you were the author of this crime, or an accomplice in its commission, or that with malicious cruelty you deceived us: far be such conduct from your life and conversation! At the same time, I would not wish your friendship to be of such a character as tends to make him, to his own destruction, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in his crime, and to confirm the suspicions naturally cherished by men concerning you; but rather let it be such as to move him to penitence, and to penitence corresponding in quality and in measure to the remedy demanded for the healing of such dreadful wounds. For the more you are an enemy to his crimes, the more really will you be a friend to the man himself. It will be interesting to us to learn, by your Excellency's reply to this letter, where you were on the day on which the crime was committed, how you received the tidings, and what you did thereafter, and what you said to him and heard from him when you next saw him; for I have not been able to hear anything of you in connection with this affair since my sudden departure on the succeeding day.</p>

<p>13. As to the remark in your letter that you are now compelled to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I refuse to visit <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest you should be seen there by me, you rather compel me by these words to state explicitly the reasons of my absence. One reason is, that the labour which I am <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to undergo in that city, and which I could not describe without adding as much again to the length of this letter, is more than I am able now to bear, since, in addition to my infirmities peculiar to myself, which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all my more intimate friends, I am burdened with an infirmity common to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, namely, the weakness of old age. The other reason is, that, in so far as leisure is granted me from the work imperatively demanded by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which my office specially binds me to serve, I have resolved to devote the time entirely, if the Lord will, to the labour of studies pertaining to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> learning; in doing which I think that I may, if it please the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, be of some service even to future generations.</p>

<p>14. There is, indeed, one thing in you, since you wish to hear the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which causes me very great distress: it is that, although qualified by age, as well as by life and character, to do otherwise, you still prefer to be a catechumen; as if it were not possible for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, by making progress in <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and well-doing, to become so much the more faithful and useful in the administration of public business. For surely the promotion of the welfare of men is the one great end of all your great cares and labours. And, indeed, if this were not to be the issue of your public services, it would be better for you even to sleep both day and night than to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> your rest in order to do work which can contribute nothing to the advantage of your fellow-men. Nor do I entertain the slightest <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that your Excellency . . .</p>
