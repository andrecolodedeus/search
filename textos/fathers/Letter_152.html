<h1>Letter 152</h1>

<p> <em>Report of the (Bishops) of the East to the Emperor, giving information of their proceedings, and explaining the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the delay in the arrival of the Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</em> </p>

<p>In <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the order of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> letter we have journeyed to the Ephesian metropolis. There we have found the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in confusion, and disturbed by internecine <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this is that Cyril of Alexandria and Memnon of Ephesus have banded together and mustered a great mob of rustics, and have forbidden both the celebration of the great feast of Pentecost, and the evening and morning offices. </p>

<p>They have shut the sacred churches and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> shrines; they have assembled apart with the victims of their deceit; they have wrought innumerable iniquities, trampling under foot alike the canons of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, and your own decrees. And the action has been taken in face of the order given both in writing and by word of mouth by the most excellent count Candidianus,  envoy of your Christ-loving majesty, that the council must await the arrival of the very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, coming from all quarters of the Empire, and then and not till then formally assemble in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety's</a> commands. Moreover Cyril of Alexandria had written to me, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, two days before the meeting of their synod, that the whole council was awaiting my arrival. We have therefore deposed both the aforenamed, Cyril and Memnon, and have excluded them from all the services of the church. The rest, who have participated in their iniquity, we have <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, until they shall reject and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the Chapters  issued by Cyril, which are full of the Eunomian and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and shall, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety's</a> command, assemble together with us, and shall in an orderly manner and with all exactitude, together with ourselves, examine into the questions at issue, and confirm the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers.</p>

<p>As to the delay in my own arrival be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that, in consideration of the distance of the way by land&mdash;and this was our route,&mdash; I have come very quickly, I have travelled forty stages without pausing to rest on the way; so your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> majesty may learn from the inhabitants of the towns on the route. Besides this I was detained many days in <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> by the famine there; by the daily tumults of the people; and by the unusual severity of the rainy season, which caused the torrents to swell, and threatened danger to the town.</p>
