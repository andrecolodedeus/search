<h1>Letter 153</h1>

<p> <em>Report of the same to the Empresses Pulcheria and Eudoxia.</em></p>

<p>We had expected to be able to report to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> majesties in different terms, but we are now compelled to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you the following facts, forced as we are by the irregular exercise of despotic power by Cyril of Alexandria and Memnon of Ephesus. The proper course to have been pursued, in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the command of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> majesties, would have been to wait for the arrival of the godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> on the road, and in common with them to examine into the questions at issue concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and investigate the point offered for discussion, and, after exact enquiry, to confirm the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. They had written to me that they would wait for our arrival. They heard that we were only three stages off. Then they assembled an unconstitutional council by themselves, and have ventured on proceedings iniquitous, irregular, and bristling with absurdities. And this they have done though the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> count Candidianus, sent by your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> majesties for good order's sake, expressly charged them, alike in writing and by word of mouth, to wait for the arrival of the godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been convened, and to attempt no innovation on the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, but to take their stand on the directions of our godly-minded sovereigns. Now in spite of their having heard the imperial letter and the advice of the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> count Candidianus, they have nevertheless made naught of due order. As the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says <q>They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web; and he that would eat of their eggs when he breaks them finds rottenness, and therein is a viper,</q>  Wherefore we confidently cry <q>Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works.</q> </p>

<p>They have shut the churches and the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> shrines; they have forbidden the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> feast of Pentecost; besides this they have sent the minions of their disorderly despotism into <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> private houses, uttering shocking threats, and forcing them to affix their signatures to illegal acts. We therefore considering all their preposterous conduct, have deposed the aforenamed Cyril and Memnon, and deprived them of their <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. Their associates in irregularity, whether influenced by sycophancy or by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, we have <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, until, coming to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of their own wounds, they shall heartily repent, shall <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Chapters of Cyril, which are tainted with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and Eunomius, shall recover the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Fathers in Council at Nic&aelig;a, and, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> commands of our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> sovereigns, shall, peacefully and without any tumult, assemble in synod, be willing to examine with care the questions submitted to them, and honestly protect the purity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>
