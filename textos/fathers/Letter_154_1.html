<h1>Letter 154</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Ascholius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Thessalonica</em>. </p>

<p>You have done well, and in accordance with the law of spiritual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in writing to me first, and by your good example challenging me to like energy. The friendship of the world, indeed, stands in need of actual sight and intercourse, that thence intimacy may begin. All, however, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the spirit do not need the flesh to promote affection, but are led to spiritual communion in the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Thanks, then, to the Lord Who has comforted my heart by showing me that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has not grown cold in all, but that there are yet in the world men who show the evidence of the discipleship of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The state of affairs with you seems to be something like that of the stars by night, shining some in one part of the sky and some in another, whereof the brightness is charming, and the more charming because it is unexpected. Such are you, luminaries of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, a few at most and easily counted in this gloomy state of things, shining as in a moonless night, and, besides being welcome for your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, being all the more longed for because of its being so seldom that you are found. Your letter has made your disposition quite plain to me. Although small, as far as regards the number of its syllables, in the correctness of its sentiments it was quite enough to give me <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of your mind and purpose. Your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the blessed Athanasius is plain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of your being sound as to the most important matters. In return for my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at your letter I am exceedingly grateful to my <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> son Euphemius, to whom I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that all help may be given by the Holy One, and I beg you to join in my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that we may soon receive him back with his very <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> wife, my daughter in the Lord. As to yourself, I beg that you will not stay our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at its beginning, but that you will write on every possible opportunity, and increase your good feeling towards me by constant communication. Give me news, I beg you, about your Churches and how they are situated as regards union. Pray for us here that our Lord may rebuke the winds and the sea, and that with us there may be a great, calm.</p>
