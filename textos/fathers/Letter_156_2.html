<h1>Letter 156</h1>

<p>Leo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to Leo Augustus.</p>

<h2>I. There is no need to open the question of doctrine again now.</h2>

<p>Your clemency's letter, which was full of vigorous <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and of the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I have respectfully received, which I wish I could <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>, even in the matter of my personal attendance, which your Majesty thinks necessary; for then I should gain the greater advantage from the sight of your splendour. But I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you will approve of my view when reason has shown it preferable. For since with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spiritual <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> you consistently maintain the Church's peace, and nothing is more conducive to the defence of the Faith than to adhere to those things which have been incontrovertibly defined under the unceasing guidance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, we shall seem  to be doing our best to upset the decrees, and at the bidding of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic's</a> petition to overthrow the authorities which the universal Church has adopted, and thus to remove all limits from the conflicts of Churches, and giving full rein to rebellion, to extend rather than appease contentions. And hence because after the disgraceful scenes at the synod of Ephesus, whereat through the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of Dioscorus the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith was rejected, and Eutyches' <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> accepted, nothing more useful could be devised for the preservation of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Faith than that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod of Chalcedon should rescind his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> acts, and that such care should be bestowed thereat on heavenly doctrine, that nothing should linger in any one's mind in disagreement with the utterances of either the Prophets or the Apostles, such moderation of course being observed that only the persistent rebels should be cast off from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and no one who was penitent should be denied pardon, what more in accordance with men's expectations or with religion will your Majesty be able to decree, than that no one henceforth be permitted to attack what has been determined by decrees which are Divine rather than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, lest they be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> worthy but to lose God's gift, who have dared to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> concerning His Truth?</p>

<h2>II. The proposal to reconsider the question proceeds from Antichrist or the Devil himself.</h2>

<p>Since, therefore, the universal Church has become a rock (<em>petra</em>) through the building up of that original Rock , and the first of the Apostles, the most blessed Peter, heard the voice of the Lord saying, <q>You are Peter, and upon this rock (<em>petra</em>) I will build My Church <span class="stiki" id="note360577"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span>,</q> who is there who dare assail such impregnable strength, unless he be either antichrist or the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who, abiding unconverted in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, is anxious to sow lies by the vessels of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> which are suited to his treachery, while under the false name of diligence he pretends to be in search of the Truth. And his unrestrained <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and blind <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> has deservedly brought contempt and disrepute on himself, so that while he rages against the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a> with diabolical purpose, men may learn the character of those who desire to reconsider the Synod of Chalcedon. For it cannot possibly have been that an opinion was there expressed contrary to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod of Nic&aelig;a, as the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> maintain, who pretend that they hold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Nicene Council, in which our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and venerable fathers, being assembled against <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, affirmed not that the Lord's Flesh, but that the Son's Godhead was <em><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a></em> with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, whereas in the <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a> against the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of Eutyches, it was defined that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> took the reality of our body from the substance of the Virgin-mother.</p>

<h2>III. All the bishops of Christendom agree with him in this.</h2>

<p>Therefore in addressing our most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperor, who is worthy to be classed among the champions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I use the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith and fearlessly exhort you to throw in your lot with Apostles and Prophets; firmly to despise and reject those who have deprived themselves of their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> name, and not to let <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> parricides, who, it is agreed, wish to annul the Faith, discuss that Faith under treacherous pretexts. For since the Lord has enriched your clemency with such insight into His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, you ought unhesitatingly to consider that the kingly power has been conferred on you not for the governance of the world alone but more especially for the guardianship of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: that by quelling <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> attempts you may both defend that which has been rightly decreed, and restore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace where there has been disturbance, that is to say by deposing usurpers  of the rights of others and reinstating the ancient Faith in the See of Alexandria, that by your reforms God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> may be appeased, and so He take not vengeance for their doings on a people hitherto religious, but forgive them. Set before the eyes of your heart, venerable Emperor, the fact that all the Lord's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> which are in all the world, are beseeching you on behalf of that Faith, wherein is Redemption for the whole world. In which those maintainers of the Apostolic Faith more particularly appeal to you who have presided over the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a>, entreating your Majesty not to allow <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who have rightfully been condemned for their perversity, to continue in their usurpation ; for, whether you look at the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> or consider the deed which their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> has perpetrated, not only are they unable to be admitted to the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but they even deserve to be cut off from the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. For&mdash; and I entreat your Majesty's forgiveness for saying so&mdash; they to some extent dim your own splendour, most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Emperor, when such treacherous parricides dare to ask for that which even the guiltless could not lawfully obtain.</p>

<h2>IV. The difference between the two petitions which have been presented to the Emperor.</h2>

<p>Petitions have been presented to your Majesty , copies of which you subjoined to your letter. But in that which comes in deprecation from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, a list of signatures is contained: and because their case had good reason in it, the names of individuals, and even their dignified rank is confidently disclosed. But in that, which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> intrusion has not feared to offer to our <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Emperor under the vague sanction of a motley body, all particular names are withheld for this reason, lest not only the paucity of members but also their worth might be discovered. For they think it expedient to conceal their number, though their quality is indicated, and not improperly they are afraid to proclaim their position, seeing that they deserve to be condemned. In the one document therefore is contained the petition of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, in the other the fictions of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are set forth. Here the overthrow of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, of the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people, and of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> is bemoaned: there is displayed the continuance of gigantic wrongs, so that what ought never to have been heard of  is allowed to be widely extended.</p>

<h2>V. It is a great opportunity for the Emperor to show his faith.</h2>

<p>Is it not clear which side you ought to support and which to oppose, if the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a>, which has always been the <q>house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,</q> is not now to be <q>a den of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360582"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;19:46</a></span>?</q> For surely it is manifest that through the cruellest and maddest savagery all the light of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> is extinguished. The offering of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> is cut off, the hallowing of the chrism has failed , and from the murderous hands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men all the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> have withdrawn themselves. Nor can there be any manner of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> what decree ought to be passed on these then, who after unutterable acts of sacrilege, after shedding the blood of a most highly reputed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and scattering the ashes of his burnt body to be the sport of the winds of heaven, dare to demand for themselves the rights of a usurped dignity and to arraign before councils the inviolable Faith of the Apostolic teaching. Great, therefore, is the opportunity for you to add to your diadem from the Lord's hand the crown of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> also, and to triumph over the Church's foes: for, if it be matter of praise to you to vanquish the armies of opposing nations, how great will be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of freeing from its mad tyrant the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a>, the affliction of which is an injury to all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>?</p>

<h2>VI. He promises more detailed statements on the Faith subsequently, and begs him to correct certain things in which Anatolius is remiss.</h2>

<p>But in order that my correspondence may have the effect on your Majesty of a mouth to mouth colloquy, I have seen that whatever suggestions I would make about our common Faith, must be conveyed in subsequent communications.  And lest the pages of this epistle reach too great a length, I have comprised in another letter what is agreeable to the maintenance of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, in order that, though the published statements of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> were sufficient, yet these additional statements might also break down the snares of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For your Majesty's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> and Apostolic mind ought to be still further kindled to righteous vengeance by this pestilential <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which mars the purity of the church of Constantinople, in which are found certain <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a>, who agree with the interpretations of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and within the very heart of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> assist them by their support.  In removing whom if my brother Anatolius is found remiss through too good-natured leniency, vouchsafe to show your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by administering this remedy also to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that such men be driven not only from the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but also from dwelling in the city. I commend to you your Majesty's loyal subjects, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Julian and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Aetius, with a request that you will deign to listen quietly to their suggestions in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, because they are in good <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> men who may be found helpful to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in all things. Dated the 1st of Dec. in the consulship of the illustrious Constantine and Rufus (457).</p>
