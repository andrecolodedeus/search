<h1>Letter 157</h1>

<p> <em>Report of the Council of (the Bishops of) the East to the Victorious Emperor, announcing a second time the deposition of Cyril and of Memnon.</em> </p>

<p>Your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, which shines forth for the good of the empire and of the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has commanded us to assemble at Ephesus, in order to bring about peace and gain for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, rather than to confuse and disturb it. And the commands of your majesty plainly and distinctly indicate your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and peaceful intentions for the churches of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But Cyril of Alexandria, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, it would seem, born and bred for the bane of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, after taking into partnership the audacity of Memnon of Ephesus, has first of all transgressed against your quieting and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> decree, and has so showed his general depravity. Your majesty had ordered an investigation and careful testing to be made concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that with the consent and concord of all. Cyril, challenged, or rather himself convicting himself, on the count of the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> doctrines, by means of the letter which he lately sent to the imperial city, with <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematisms</a>, whereby he is convicted of sharing the views of the impious and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>, pays no heed to this condition of things, and, as though we were living with no emperor to govern us, is proceeding to every kind of lawlessness. He ought himself to be called to account for his unsound opinion about <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; but, usurping an authority given him neither by the canons, nor by your edicts, he is hurrying headlong into every kind of disorder and illegality.</p>

<p>Moved by these things the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, which has refused to accept his devices for the damage of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for the aforesaid reasons deposes him. It deposes Memnon also, who has been his counsellor and abettor through all, who has kept up constant agitation against the very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> for refusing to assent to his pernicious heterodoxy; who has shut the churches and every place of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as if we were living among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; who has brought in the Ephesian mob, so that every day we are in supreme danger, while we look not to defence, but heed the right doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. For the destruction of these men is identical with the establishment of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>.</p>

<p>From his own Chapters your majesty can have no difficulty in perceiving his impious mind. He is convicted of trying, so to say, to raise from Hades the impious <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>, who died in his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and of attacking the churches and the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. He is shown in his publications to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> at once <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and them that succeeded them as forefathers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who, moved not by their own imaginations, but by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit, have preached the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and proclaimed the gospel; a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and gospel indeed opposed to what this man holds and teaches and by inculcating which he wishes to give his own private iniquity the mastery of the world. Since this is intolerable to us we have followed the proper course, relying at once on the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> and on your majesty's good will.</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you give to nothing higher <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> than to the sacred <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in which both you and your thrice blessed forefathers have been brought up. From them you have received the perpetual sceptre of empire, ever putting down the opponents of the apostolic doctrines. Such an opponent is the aforesaid Cyril, who, with the aid of Memnon, has captured Ephesus as he might some fortress, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> shares with his ally the sentence of deposition. Justly: for, besides all that has been said, they have boldly tried every means of assault and every <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> against us, who, to come together in council in ratification of your edict, have disregarded every claim of home and country and self.</p>

<p>We are now the prey of tyranny, unless your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> intervene and order us to assemble in some other place, near at hand, where we shall be able, from the scriptures, and from the writings of the Fathers, to refute beyond contradiction both Cyril and the victims of his ingenuity. We have mercifully expelled these men from communion with the suggested hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in case they should repent; although, as if on some campaign of uncivilized soldiery, they have up to this moment furnished him with the means of his illegality. Some were deposed long ago, and have been restored by Cyril. Some have been <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by their own metropolitans, and admitted by him again into communion. Others have been impaled on various accusations, and have been promoted by him to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. All through, the main motive of his action has been the endeavour to achieve his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> purpose by the force of numbers, for he does not reckon as he ought that in what relates to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, it is not numbers that are required, but rather correctness of doctrine and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. Men are needed who are competent to establish these points not by audacity and masterful self-assertion but by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> use of apostolic testimony and example.</p>

<p>For all these reasons we beseech and implore your majesty to bear prompt aid to assaulted <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and to remedy without delay these men's masterful readiness; for, like a hurricane, it is sweeping the less moderate among us into pernicious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> has had care for the churches in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a> and among the barbarians; it is only right that you should not neglect those which are tossed by the storm within the boundaries of the Roman empire.</p>
