<h1>Letter 158</h1>

<p> <em>Report of (the Bishops of) the East to the Very Pious Emperor, which they delivered with the preceding Report to the Right Honourable Count <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>.</em></p>

<p>On receiving the letter of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> we entertained hopes that the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> storm which has lately struck the churches of God would be driven away. But we have been disappointed. Those men have been made even yet more daring by their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; they have given no heed to the sentence of deposition <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and in due forth passed upon them, nor have become any more moderate in consequence of the rebuke of your majesty. They have trampled down alike the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and the canons of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, and, some of them being deposed and some <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, keep festivals, and celebrate communion, in Houses of Prayer. And we, as we have already informed your Christ-loving majesty, on the receipt of your clemency's kindly letter, though our only desire was to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in the church of the Apostles, have not only been prevented, but actually <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, and chased for a considerable distance, so that we were compelled to effect our safety by flight at full speed. Our opponents on the contrary think that they may act just as they please. They have declined to make investigation of the questions at issue, and to undertake the defence of Cyril's <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Chapters, rejecting the plain <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of the impiety which they contain. They are impudent from mere impudence, while the examination of the questions before us requires not impudence, but calmness, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and skill in matters of doctrine.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances we have been under the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of sending forward the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Count <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, to approach your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and to explain the position of affairs. He has accurate information concerning all that has occurred, and has learned from us many modes of cure, whereby it may be possible to bring about the restoration of tranquillity to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We beseech your clemency to grant him patient audience, and to give orders for the prompt carrying out of whatever measures may seem good to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that we be not here crushed beyond all endurance.</p>
