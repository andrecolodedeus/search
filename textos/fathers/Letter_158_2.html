<h1>Letter 158</h1>

<p>Leo to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> sojourning in Constantinople.</p>

<h2>He encourages them in their sufferings for the Faith, and in their entreaties for redress to the Emperor.</h2>

<p>I have before now been so saddened by tidings of the crimes committed in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>, and my spirit has been so wounded by the atrocity of the deed itself, that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what tears to show and what lamentation to utter over it, and am fain to use the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> language, <q>who will give waters to my head and a fountain of tears to my eyes ?</q> Yet anticipating your complaint, beloved, I have entreated our most clement and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperor for a remedy of these great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and by our sons and assistants Gerontius and Olympius have at a different time demanded that he should make haste to purge of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> already condemned the church of that city, in which so many <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teachers have flourished, and not allow murderous spirits whom no reverence for place or time  could deter from shedding their ruler's blood, to gain anything from his clemency, more particularly when they desire to reconsider the council of Chalcedon to the overthrow of the Faith. Accordingly the same reason, beloved, which drove you from your own Sees, ought to console you for your sufferings; for it is certain that afflicted <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, that suffer adversity for His name, are in no wise deprived of the Lord's protection. Bear it therefore bravely, and mindful of that country which is yours, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over your present sojourn in a strange land. Abstain from grieving over your exile and indulge not in sorrow for your present weariness, you who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Apostle glories even in his many perils on behalf of the Lord's Faith. You have One who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> your conflicts and has prepared the rewards of recompense. Let no one shrink from this labour, whose reward is to reign and  live for ever. Let the feet of all who fight be fixed in the halls of Jerusalem; for in the hope of that retribution they will have no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the camp nor the onsets of the enemy. Victory is never hard nor triumph difficult over the remnants of an abject foe who has been routed by the whole world alike, especially over those whose ringleaders you see already prostrate. With unceasing <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, therefore (even as I also have not failed to do), entreat the favour of the most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperor, who in God's mercy is ready to hear: that in accordance with the letter I have sent , he may strengthen the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the common Faith with that devotion of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which we are well assured he possesses, and in his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> may remove all the harmful charges which the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> has invented, and arrange for your return, beloved, and so may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> each several province and all the churches with their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the unshaken peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Dated the 1st of Dec. in the consulship of Constantine and Rufus (457).</p>
