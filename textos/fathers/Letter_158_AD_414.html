<h1>Letter 158 (A.D. 414)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Lord Augustine, My Brother Partner in the Sacerdotal Office, Most Sincerely Loved, with Profound Respect, and to the Brethren Who are with Him, Evodius</em>  <em>and the Brethren Who are with Him Send Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. I urgently beg you to send the reply due to my last letter. Indeed, I would have preferred first to learn what I then asked, and afterwards to put the questions which I now submit to you. Give me your attention while I relate an event in which you will kindly take an interest, and which has made me impatient to lose no time in acquiring, if possible in this life, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which I desired. I had a certain youth as a clerk, a son of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Armenus of Melonita, whom, by my <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> instrumentality, God rescued when he was becoming already immersed in secular affairs, for he was employed as a shorthand writer by the proconsul's solicitor.  He was then, indeed, as boys usually are, prompt and somewhat restless, but as he grew older (for his death occurred in his twenty-second year) a gravity of deportment and circumspect probity of life so adorned him that it is a pleasure to dwell upon his memory. He was, moreover, a clever stenographer,  and indefatigable in writing: he had begun also to be earnest in reading, so that he even urged me to do more than my indolence would have chosen, in order to spend hours of the night in reading, for he read aloud to me for a time every night after all was still; and in reading, he would not pass over any sentence unless he understood it, and would go over it a third or even a fourth time, and not leave it until what he wished to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> was made clear. I had begun to regard him not as a mere boy and clerk, but as a comparatively intimate and pleasant friend, for his conversation gave me much delight.</p>

<p>2. He desired also to <q>depart and to be with Christ,</q>  a desire which has been fulfilled. For he was ill for sixteen days in his father's house, and by strength of memory he continually repeated portions of Scripture throughout almost the whole time of his illness. But when he was very near to the end of his life, he sang  so as to be heard by all, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> longs for and hastens unto the courts of the Lord,</q>  after which he sang again, <q>You have anointed my head with oil, and beautiful is Your cup, overpowering my senses with delight!</q>  In these things he was wholly occupied; in the consolation yielded by them he found satisfaction. At the last, when dissolution was just coming upon him, he began to make the <a href="../cathen/13785a.htm">sign of the cross</a> on his forehead, and in finishing this his hand was moving down to his mouth, which also he wished to mark with the same sign, but the inward man (which had been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> renewed day by day) <span class="stiki" id="note112661"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> had, ere this was done, forsaken the tabernacle of clay. To myself there has been given so great an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, that I think that after leaving his own body he has entered into my spirit, and is there imparting to me a certain fullness of light from his presence, for I am conscious of a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> beyond all measure through his deliverance and safety&mdash; indeed it is ineffable. For I felt no small anxiety on his account, being afraid of the dangers peculiar to his years. For I was at pains to inquire of himself whether perchance he had been defiled by intercourse with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>; he solemnly assured us that he was free from this stain, by which declaration our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> was still more increased. So he died. We <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> his memory by suitable obsequies, such as were due to one so excellent, for we continued during three days to praise the Lord with <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> at his grave, and on the third day we offered the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of redemption. </p>

<p>3. Behold, however, two days thereafter, a certain respectable <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> from Figentes, an handmaid from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who said that she had been twelve years in widowhood, saw the following vision in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>. She saw a certain <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who had died four years ago, preparing a palace, with the assistance of servants and handmaids of God (<a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>). It was being so much adorned that the place was refulgent with splendor, and appeared to be wholly made of silver. On her inquiring eagerly for whom this palace was being prepared, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> aforesaid answered, <q>For the young man, the son of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, who was cut off yesterday.</q> There appeared in the same palace an old man robed in white, who gave orders to two others, also dressed in white, to go, and having raised the body from the grave, to carry it up with them to heaven. And she added, that so soon as the body had been taken up from the grave and carried to heaven, there sprang from the same sepulchre branches of the rose, called from its folded blossoms the virgin rose.</p>

<p>4. I have narrated the event: listen now, if you please, to my question, and teach me what I ask, for the departure of that young man's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> forces such questions from me. While we are in the body, we have an inward faculty of perception which is alert in proportion to the activity of our attention, and is more wakeful and eager the more earnestly attentive we become: and it seems to us probable that even in its highest activity it is retarded by the encumbrance of the body, for who can fully describe all that the mind suffers through the body! In the midst of the perturbation and annoyance which come from the suggestions, <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, necessities, and varied afflictions of which the body is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the mind does not surrender its strength, it resists and conquers. Sometimes it is defeated; nevertheless, mindful of what is its own nature, it becomes, under the stimulating influence of such labours, more active and more wary, and breaks through the meshes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and so makes its way to better things. Your Holiness will kindly understand what I mean to say. Therefore, while we are in this life, we are hindered by such deficiencies, and are nevertheless, as it is written, <q>more than conquerors through Him that loved us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112663"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse37">Romans&nbsp;8:37</a></span> When we go forth from this body, and escape from every burden, and from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, with its incessant activity, what are we?</p>

<p>5. In the first place, I ask whether there may not be some kind of body (formed, perchance, of one of the four elements, either air or ether) which does not depart from the incorporeal principle, that is, the substance properly called the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, when it forsakes this earthly body. For as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in its nature incorporeal, if it be absolutely disembodied by death there is now one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of all that have left this world. And in that case where would the rich man, who was clothed in purple, and Lazarus, who was full of sores, now be? How, moreover, could they be distinguished according to their respective deserts, so that the one should have suffering and the other have <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, if there were only a single <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> made by the combination of all disembodied <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, unless, of course, these things are to be understood in a figurative sense? Be that as it may, there is no question that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which are held in definite places (as that rich man was in the flame, and that poor man was in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom) are held in bodies. If there are distinct places, there are bodies, and in these bodies the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> reside; and even although the punishments and rewards are experienced in the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which experiences them is nevertheless in a body. Whatever is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of that one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> made up of many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, it must be possible for it in its unbroken unity to be both grieved and made glad at the same moment, if it is to approve itself to be really a substance consisting of many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> gathered into one. If, however, this <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is called one only in the same way as the incorporeal mind is called one, although it has in it memory, and will, and <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, and if it be alleged that all these are separate incorporeal causes or powers and have their several distinctive offices and work without one impeding another in any way, I think this might be in some measure answered by saying that it must be also possible for some of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to be under punishment and some of the sours to enjoy rewards simultaneously in this one substance consisting of many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> gathered into One.</p>

<p>6. Or if this be not so [that is, if there be no such body remaining still in union with the incorporeal principle after it quits this earthly body], what is there to hinder each <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from having, when separated from the solid body which it here inhabits, another body, so that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> always animates a body of some kind? Or in what body does it pass to any region, if such there be, to which necessity compels it to go? For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves, if they were not numbered by bodies of some kind which they have, could not be called many, as they are by the Truth Himself when He said in the gospel, <q>I could <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and He will presently give me twelve legions of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112664"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse53">Matthew&nbsp;26:53</a></span> Again it is certain that Samuel was seen in the body when he was raised at the request of Saul; <span class="stiki" id="note112665"><a href="../bible/1sa028.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;28:14</a></span> and as to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, whose body was buried, it is plain from the gospel narrative that he came in the body to the Lord on the mountain to which He and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had retired. <span class="stiki" id="note112666"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;17:3</a></span> In the Apocrypha, and in the <em> Mysteries of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a></em>, a writing which is wholly devoid of authority, it is indeed said that, at the time when he ascended the mount to die, through the power which his body possessed, there was one body which was committed to the earth, and another which was joined to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who accompanied him; but I do not feel myself called upon to give to a sentence in <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal writings</a> a preference over the definite statements quoted above. We must therefore give attention to this, and search out, by the help either of the authority of revelation or of the light of reason, the matter about which we are inquiring. But it is alleged that the future resurrection of the body is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was after death absolutely without a body. This is not, however, an unanswerable objection, for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who are like our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> invisible, have at times desired to appear in bodily forms and be seen, and (whatever might be the form of body worthy to be assumed by these spirits) they have appeared, for example, to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> <span class="stiki" id="note112667"><a href="../bible/gen018.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;18:6</a></span> and to Tobias. <span class="stiki" id="note112668"><a href="../bible/tob012.htm#verse16">Tobit&nbsp;12:16</a></span> Therefore it is quite possible that the resurrection of the body may, as we assuredly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, take place, and yet that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may be reunited to it without its being found to have been at any moment wholly devoid of some kind of body. Now the body which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> here occupies consists of the four elements, of which one, namely heat, seems to depart from this body at the same moment as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For there remains after death that which is made of earth, moisture also is not wanting to the body, nor is the element of cold matter gone; heat alone has fled, which perhaps the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> takes along with it if it migrates from place to place. This is all that I say meanwhile concerning the body.</p>

<p>7. It seems to me also, that if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> while occupying the living body is capable, as I have said, of strenuous mental application, how much more unencumbered, active, vigorous, earnest, resolute, and persevering will it be, how much enlarged in capacity and improved in character, if it has while in this body learned to relish <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>! For after laying aside this body, or rather, after having this cloud swept away, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will have come to be free from all disturbing influences, enjoying tranquillity and exempt from <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, seeing whatever it has longed for, and embracing what it has loved. Then, also, it will be capable of remembering and recognising friends, both those who went before it from this world, and those whom it left here below. Perhaps this may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, but I desire to learn. But it would greatly distress me to think that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after death passes into a state of torpor, being as it were buried, just as it is during sleep while it is in the body, living only in hope, but having nothing and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing, especially if in its sleep it be not even stirred by any dreams. This notion causes me very great horror, and seems to indicate that the life of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is extinguished at death.</p>

<p>8. This also I would ask: Supposing that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be discovered to have such a body as we speak of, does that body lack any of the senses? Of course, if there cannot be imposed upon it any necessity for smelling, tasting, or touching, as I suppose will be the case, these senses will be wanting; but I hesitate as to the senses of sight and hearing. For are not devils said to hear (not, indeed, in all the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom they harass, for in regard to these there is a question), even when they appear in bodies of their own? And as to the faculty of sight, how can they pass from one place to another if they have a body but are void of the power of seeing, so as to guide its motions? Do you think that this is not the case with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> when they go forth from the body&mdash;that they have still a body of some kind, and are not deprived of some at least of the senses proper to this body? Else how can we explain the fact that very many dead <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have been observed by day, or by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> awake and walking abroad during the night, to pass into houses just as they were wont to do in their lifetime? This I have heard not once, but often; and I have also heard it said that in places in which dead bodies are interred, and especially in churches, there are commotions and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are heard for the most part at a certain time of the night. This I remember hearing from more than one: for a certain <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> was an eye-<a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of such an apparition, having observed a multitude of such phantoms issuing from the <a href="../cathen/02276b.htm">baptistery</a> in bodies full of light, after which he heard their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the midst of the church itself. All such things are either <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and therefore helpful to the inquiry which we are now making, or are mere fables, in which case the fact of their invention is wonderful; nevertheless I would desire to get some information from the fact that they come and visit men, and are seen otherwise than in dreams.</p>

<p>9. These dreams suggest another question. I do not at this moment concern myself about the mere creations of fancy, which are formed by the emotions of the uneducated. I speak of visitations in sleep, such as the apparition to Joseph <span class="stiki" id="note112669"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a></span> in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, in the manner experienced in most cases of the kind. In the same manner, therefore, our own friends also who have departed this life before us sometimes come and appear to us in dreams, and speak to us. For I myself remember that Profuturus, and Privatus, and Servilius, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men who within my recollection were removed by death from our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, spoke to me, and that the events of which they spoke came to pass according to their words. Or if it be some other higher spirit that assumes their form and visits our minds, I leave this to the all-seeing eye of Him before whom everything from the highest to the lowest is uncovered. If, therefore, the Lord be pleased to speak through reason to your Holiness on all these questions, I beg you to be so kind as make me partaker of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which you have received. There is another thing which I have resolved not to omit mentioning, for perhaps it bears upon the matter now under investigation:</p>

<p>10. This same youth, in connection with whom these questions are brought forward, departed this life after having received what may be called a summons  at the time when he was dying. For one who had been a companion of his as a student, and reader, and shorthand writer to my dictation, who had died eight months before, was seen by a person in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> coming towards him. When he was asked by the person who then distinctly saw him why he had come, he said, <q>I have come to take this friend away;</q> and so it <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. For in the house itself, also, there appeared to a certain old man, who was almost awake, a man bearing in his hand a laurel branch on which something was written. Nay, more, when this one was seen, it is further reported that after the death of the young man, his father the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> had begun to reside along with the aged Theasius in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, in order to find consolation there, but lo! On the third day after his death, the young man is seen entering the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and is asked by one of the brethren in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> of some kind whether he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> himself to be dead. He replied that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> he was. The other asked whether he had been welcomed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This also he answered with great expressions of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. And when questioned as to the reason why he had come, he answered, <q>I have been sent to summon my father.</q> The person to whom these things were shown awakes, and relates what had passed. It comes to the ear of Bishop Theasius. He, being alarmed, sharply admonished the person who told him, lest the matter should come, as it might easily do, to the ear of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> himself, and he should be disturbed by such tidings. But why prolong the narration? Within about four days from this visitation he was saying (for he had suffered from a moderate feverishness) that he was now out of danger, and that the physician had given up attending him, having assured him that there was no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever for anxiety; but that very day this <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> expired after he had lain down on his couch. Nor should I forbear mentioning, that on the same day on which the youth died, he asked his father three times to forgive him anything in which he might have offended, and every time that he kissed his father he said to him, <q>Let us give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, father,</q> and insisted upon his father saying the words along with him, as if he were exhorting one who was to be his companion in going forth from this world. And in fact only seven days elapsed between the two deaths. What shall we say of things so wonderful? Who shall be a thoroughly reliable teacher as to these <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> dispensations? To you in the hour of perplexity my agitated heart unburdens itself. The divine appointment of the death of the young man and of his father is beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, for two sparrows shall not fall to the ground without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of our heavenly Father. <span class="stiki" id="note112671"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;10:29</a></span> </p>

<p>11. That the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot exist in absolute separation from a body of some kind is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in my opinion by the fact that to exist without body belongs to God alone. But I think that the laying aside of so great a burden as the body, in the act of passing from this world, proves that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> will then be very much more wakeful than it is meanwhile; for then the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> appears, as I think, far more noble when no longer encumbered by so great a hindrance, both in action and in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and that entire spiritual rest proves it to be free from all causes of disturbance and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but does not make it languid, and as it were slow, torpid, and embarrassed, inasmuch as it is enough for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to enjoy in its fullness the liberty to which it has attained in being freed from the world and the body; for, as you have wisely said, the <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> is satisfied with food, and applies the lips of the spirit to the fountain of life in that condition in which it is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> and blest in the undisputed lordship of its own faculties. For before I quitted the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> I saw brother Servilius in a dream after his decease, and he said that we were labouring to attain by the exercise of reason to an understanding of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whereas he and those who were in the same state as he were always resting in the pure <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>.</p>

<p>12. I also beg you to explain to me in how many ways the word wisdom is used; as God is wisdom, and a wise mind is wisdom (in which way it is said to be as light); as we read also of the wisdom of Bezaleel, who made the tabernacle or the ointment, and the wisdom of Solomon, or any other wisdom, if there be such, and wherein they differ from each other; and whether the one <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Wisdom which is with the Father is to be understood as spoken of in these different degrees, as they are called diverse gifts of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who divides to every one severally according as He will. Or, with the exception of that Wisdom alone which was not created, were these created, and have they a distinct <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of their own? Or are they effects, and have they received their name from the definition of their work? I am asking a great many questions. May the Lord grant you <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to discover the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> sought, and wisdom sufficient to commit it to writing, and to communicate it without delay to me. I have written in much <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and in a homely style; but since you think it worth while to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that about which I am inquiring, I beseech you in the name of Christ the Lord to correct me where I am mistaken, and teach me what you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I am desirous to learn.</p>
