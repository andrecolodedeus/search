<h1>Letter 15</h1>

<p><strong>To Pope Damasus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This letter, written in 376 or 377 A.D., illustrates Jerome's attitude towards the see of Rome at this time held by Damasus, afterwards his warm friend and admirer. Referring to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> as the scene of his own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and as a church where the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has remained unimpaired (&sect;1), and laying down the strict doctrine of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> only within the pale of the church (&sect;2), Jerome asks <q>the successor of the fisherman</q> two questions, viz.: (1) who is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the three claimants of the see of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, and (2) which is the correct terminology, to speak of three <q>hypostases</q> in the Godhead, or of one? On the latter question he expresses fully his own opinion.</span> </p>

<p>1. Since the East, shattered as it is by the long-standing feuds, subsisting between its peoples, is bit by bit tearing into shreds the seamless vest of the Lord, <q>woven from the top throughout,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300261"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;19:23</a></span> since the foxes are destroying the vineyard of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300262"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse15">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:15</a></span> and since among the broken cisterns that hold no water it is hard to discover <q>the sealed fountain</q> and <q>the garden inclosed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300263"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse12">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:12</a></span> I think it my duty to consult the chair of Peter, and to turn to a church whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been praised by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.  I appeal for spiritual food to the church whence I have received the garb of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  The wide space of sea and land that lies between us cannot deter me from searching for <q>the pearl of great price.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300266"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse46">Matthew&nbsp;13:46</a></span> <q>Wheresoever the body is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300267"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;24:28</a></span> Evil children have squandered their patrimony; you alone keep your heritage intact. The fruitful soil of Rome, when it receives the pure seed of the Lord, bears fruit an hundredfold; but here the seed grain is choked in the furrows and nothing grows but darnel or oats. <span class="stiki" id="note300268"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;13:22-23</a></span> In the West the Sun of righteousness <span class="stiki" id="note300269"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse2">Malachi&nbsp;4:2</a></span> is even now rising; in the East, Lucifer, who fell from heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note300270"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;10:18</a></span> has once more set his throne above the stars. <span class="stiki" id="note300271"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;14:12</a></span> <q>You are the light of the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300272"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;5:14</a></span> <q>you are the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300273"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;5:13</a></span> you are <q>vessels of gold and of silver.</q> Here are vessels of wood or of earth, <span class="stiki" id="note300274"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:20</a></span> which wait for the rod of iron, <span class="stiki" id="note300275"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse27">Revelation&nbsp;2:27</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>.</p>

<p>2. Yet, though your greatness terrifies me, your kindness attracts me. From the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> I demand the safe-keeping of the victim, from the shepherd the protection due to the sheep. Away with all that is overweening; let the state of Roman majesty withdraw. My words are spoken to the successor of the fisherman, to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the cross. As I follow no leader save Christ, so I communicate with none but your blessedness, that is with the chair of Peter. For this, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is the rock on which the church is built! <span class="stiki" id="note300276"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> This is the house where alone the paschal lamb can be rightly eaten. <span class="stiki" id="note300277"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;12:22</a></span> This is the ark of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and he who is not found in it shall perish when the flood prevails. <span class="stiki" id="note300278"><a href="../bible/gen007.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;7:23</a></span> But since by reason of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> I have betaken myself to this desert which lies between <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and the uncivilized waste, I cannot, owing to the great distance between us, always ask of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing of the Lord.  Consequently  I here follow the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> confessors  who share your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and anchor my frail craft under the shadow of their great argosies. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of Vitalis; I reject Meletius; I have nothing to do with Paulinus.  He that gathers not with you scatters; <span class="stiki" id="note300282"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> he that is not of Christ is of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a>.</p>

<p>3. Just now, I am sorry to say, those <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, the Campenses,  are trying to extort from me, a Roman <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, their unheard-of formula of three hypostases.  And this, too, after the definition of Nic&aelig;a  and the decree of Alexandria,  in which the West has joined. Where, I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, are the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of these doctrines? Where is their <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, their new doctor of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>? I ask them what three hypostases are supposed to mean. They reply three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> subsisting. I rejoin that this is my belief. They are not satisfied with the meaning, they demand the term. Surely some secret venom lurks in the words. <q>If any man refuse,</q> I cry, <q>to acknowledge three hypostases in the sense of three things hypostatized, that is three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> subsisting, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>.</q> Yet, because I do not learn their words, I am counted a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. <q>But, if any one, understanding by hypostasis <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>,  deny that in the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there is one hypostasis, he has no part in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Because this is my confession I, like you, am branded with the stigma of Sabellianism. </p>

<p>4. If you think fit enact a decree; and then I shall not hesitate to speak of three hypostases. Order a new creed to supersede the Nicene; and then, whether we are <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> or <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, one confession will do for us all. In the whole range of secular learning hypostasis never means anything but <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. And can any one, I ask, be so profane as to speak of three essences or substances in the Godhead? There is one nature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and one only; and this, and this alone, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <em>is.</em> For absolute being is derived from no other source but is all its own. All things besides, that is all things created, although they appear to be, are not. For there was a time when they were not, and that which once was not may again cease to be. God alone who is <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, that is to say, who has no beginning, really deserves to be called an <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. Therefore also He says to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> from the bush, <q>I am that I am,</q> and <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> says of Him, <q>I am has sent me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300289"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;3:14</a></span> As the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the sky, the earth, the seas, all <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> at the time, it must have been as the absolute being that God claimed for himself that name of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, which apparently was common to all. But because His nature alone is perfect, and because in the three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> there subsists but one Godhead, which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is and is one nature; whosoever in the name of religion declares that there are in the Godhead three elements, three hypostases, that is, or essences, is striving really to predicate three natures of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And if this is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, why are we severed by walls from <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, when in dishonesty we are one with him? Let Ursicinus be made the colleague of your blessedness; let Auxentius be associated with Ambrose.  But may the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Rome never come to such a pass! May the devout hearts of your people never be infected with such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> doctrines! Let us be satisfied to speak of one substance and of three subsisting <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>&mdash; perfect, equal, coeternal. Let us keep to one hypostasis, if such be your pleasure, and say nothing of three. It is a bad sign when those who mean the same thing use different words. Let us be satisfied with the form of creed which we have hitherto used. Or, if you think it right that I should speak of three hypostases, explaining what I mean by them, I am ready to submit. But, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, there is poison hidden under their honey; the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> has transformed himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light. <span class="stiki" id="note300291"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> They give a plausible explanation of the term hypostasis; yet when I profess to hold it in the same sense they count me a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Why are they so tenacious of a word? Why do they shelter themselves under ambiguous language? If their belief corresponds to their explanation of it, I do not condemn them for keeping it. On the other hand, if my belief corresponds to their expressed opinions, they should allow me to set forth their meaning in my own words.</p>

<p>5. I implore your blessedness, therefore, by the crucified Saviour of the world, and by the consubstantial trinity, to authorize me by letter either to use or to refuse this formula of three hypostases. And lest the obscurity of my present abode may baffle the bearers of your letter, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you to address it to Evagrius, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, with whom you are well acquainted. I beg you also to signify with whom I am to communicate at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>. Not, I hope, with the Campenses;  for they&mdash; with their allies the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of Tarsus &mdash; only desire communion with you to preach with greater authority their traditional doctrine of three hypostases.</p>
