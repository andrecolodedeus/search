<h1>Letter 15 (A.D. 390)</h1>

<p> <em>To Romanianus Augustine Sends Greeting.</em></p>

<p>1. This letter indicates a scarcity of paper,  but not so as to testify that parchment is plentiful here. My ivory tablets I used in the letter which I sent to your uncle. You will more readily excuse this scrap of parchment, because what I wrote to him could not be delayed, and I thought that not to write to you for want of better material would be most absurd. But if any tablets of mine are with you, I request you to send them to meet a case of this kind. I have written something, as the Lord has deigned to enable me, concerning the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> religion, which before my coming I wish to send to you, if my paper does not fail me in the meantime. For you will receive with indulgence any kind of writing from the office of the brethren who are with me. As to the manuscripts of which you speak, I have entirely forgotten them, except the books <em>de Oratore</em>; but I could not have written anything better than that you should take such of them as you please, and I am still of the same mind; for at this distance I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what else I can do in the matter.</p>

<p>2. It gave me very great pleasure that in your last letter you desired to make me a sharer of your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at home; but</p>

<blockquote><p>Would you have me forget how soon the deep,
<br>So tranquil now, may wear another face,
<br>And rouse these slumbering waves? 
</p></blockquote>

<p>Yet I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you would not have me forget this, nor are you yourself unmindful of it. Wherefore, if some leisure is granted you for more profound meditation, improve this divine blessing. For when these things fall to our lot, we should not only congratulate ourselves, but show our gratitude to those to whom we owe them; for if in the stewardship of temporal blessings we act in a manner that is just and kind, and with the moderation and sobriety of spirit which befits the transient nature of these possessions,&mdash; if they are held by us without laying hold on us, are multiplied without entangling us, and serve us without bringing us into bondage, such conduct entitles us to the recompense of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessings. For by Him who is the Truth it was said: <q>If you have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who will give you that which is your own?</q> Let us therefore disengage ourselves from care about the passing things of time; let us seek the blessings that are imperishable and sure; let us soar above our worldly possessions. The bee does not the less need its wings when it has gathered an abundant store; for if it sink in the honey it dies.</p>
