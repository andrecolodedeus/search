<h1>Letter 162</h1>

<p> <em>Letter of Theodoretus to Andreas, Bishop of Samosata, written from Ephesus.</em> </p>

<p>Writing from Ephesus I salute your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, I congratulate you on your infirmity, and deem you dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in that you have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> have been going on here by report, and not by personal experience. Evil indeed! They transcend all imagination and all incidents of history; they compel a continual downpour of tears. The body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is in peril of dismemberment;&mdash; nay, rather I may say it has received the first incision;&mdash; unless the wise Healer restore and re-connect the unsound and severed limbs. Once again the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> is raging against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and warring with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> His servants, and the more part of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> are on the side of the foe; for all too few are the sound who willingly suffer for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion's sake. Ancient principles are trodden under foot. Deposed men perform <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions, and they who have deposed them sit sighing at home. Men <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by the same sentence as the deposed have relieved the deposed of their deposition of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. Such is the mockery of a synod held by Egyptians, by Palestinians, by men from the Pontic and Asian <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and by the West in their company. </p>

<p>What players in a pantomime, in the days of paganism, even in any farce so held up religion to ridicule? Indeed what farce-writer ever performed such a play? What dramatist ever wrote so sad a tragedy? Such and so great are the troubles that have beset God's Church, whereof I have narrated but a very small part.</p>
