<h1>Letter 162</h1>

<p>By the hand of Philoxenus <em>agens in rebus</em>.  Leo the Bishop to Leo Augustus.</p>

<h2>I. The decrees of Chalcedon and Nic&aelig;a are identical and final.</h2>

<p>With much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> my mind exults in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and great is my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for thankfulness, now that I perceive your clemency's most excellent <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be in all things enlarged by the gifts of heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and I experience by increased diligence the devotion of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> mind in you. For in your Majesty's communications it is beyond <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> revealed what the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is working through you for the good of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and how greatly it is to be desired by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> that your empire may be everywhere extended with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, seeing that besides your care for things temporal you so perseveringly exercise a religious foresight in the service of what is divine and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>: to wit that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, which alone gives life to and alone hallows <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, may abide in the one confession, and the dissensions which spring from the variety of earthly opinions may be driven away, most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Emperor, from that solid Rock, on which the city of God is built. And these gifts of God will at last be granted us from Him, if we be not found ungrateful for what has been vouchsafed, and as though what we have gained were naught, we seek not rather the very opposite. For to seek what has been discovered, to reconsider what has been completed, and to demolish what has been defined, what else is it but to return no thanks for things gained and to indulge the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> longings of deadly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> on the food of the forbidden tree? And hence by deigning to show a more careful regard for the peace of the universal Church, you manifestly recognize what is the design of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics'</a> mighty intrigues that a more careful discussion should take place between the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of Eutyches and Dioscorus and the emissary of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, as if nothing had already been defined, and that what with the glad approval of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the whole world was determined at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod of Chalcedon should be rendered invalid to the detriment also of the most sacred Council of Nic&aelig;a. For what in our own days at Chalcedon was determined concerning <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ's</a> Incarnation, was also so defined at Nic&aelig;a by that mystic number of Fathers , lest the confession of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God's Only-begotten Son was in anything unequal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or that when He was made <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> He had not the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nature of our flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<h2>II. The wicked designs of heretics must be steadfastly resisted.</h2>

<p>Therefore we must abhor and persistently avoid what <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> deceit is striving to obtain, nor must what has been well and fully defined be brought again under discussion, lest we ourselves should seem at the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of condemned men to have doubts concerning things which it is clear agree throughout with the authority of Prophets, Evangelists, and Apostles. And hence, if there are any who disagree with these heaven-inspired decisions, let them be left to their own opinions and depart from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with that perverse <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> which they have chosen. For it can in no way be that men who dare to speak against divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> are associated in any communion with us. Let them <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> themselves on the emptiness of their talk and boast of the cleverness of their arguments against the Faith: we are pleased to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Apostle's precepts, where he says, <q>See that no one deceive you with <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> and vain seductions of men <span class="stiki" id="note360597"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse8">Colossians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> .</q> For according to the same Apostle, <q>if I build up those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor <span class="stiki" id="note360598"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse18">Galatians&nbsp;2:18</a></span>,</q> and subject myself to those conditions of punishment which not only the authority of Prince Marcian of blessed memory, but I myself also by my consent have accepted. Because as you have <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truthfully</a> maintained perfection admits of no increase nor fullness of addition. And hence, since I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, venerable Prince, imbued as you are with the purest light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, waver in no part of the Faith, but with just and perfect judgment distinguish right from wrong, and separate what is to be embraced from what is to be rejected, I beseech you not to think that my humility is to be blamed for want of confidence, since my cautiousness is not only in the interests of the universal Church but also for the furtherance of your own <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, that under your reign the unscrupulousness of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may not seem to be advanced and the security of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> disturbed.</p>

<h2>III. He promises to send envoys not to discuss with the Eutychians, but to explain the Faith to the Emperor.</h2>

<p>Although, therefore, I am very confident of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> of your heart in all things, and perceive that through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> dwelling in you, you are sufficiently instructed, nor can any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> delude your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, yet I will endeavour to follow your bidding so far as to send certain of my brothers to represent my person before you, and to set forth what the Apostolic rule of Faith is, although, as I have said, it is well known to you, in all things making it clear and certain that they are not in any way to be reckoned among <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, who do not accept the definitions of the venerable Synod of Nic&aelig;a or the ordinances of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03555a.htm">Council of Chalcedon</a>, inasmuch as it is evident the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> decrees of both proceed from the Evangelical and Apostolical source, and whatever is not of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> watering is like a snake-poisoned draught.  Your Majesty should understand beforehand, most venerable Emperor, that those whom I undertake to send will come from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, not to fight with the enemies of the Faith nor to strive against any, because of matters already settled as it has pleased God both at Nic&aelig;a and at Chalcedon we dare not enter upon any discussion, as if what so great an authority has fixed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> were doubtful or weak.</p>

<h2>IV. The heretics must be forced to give up their usurpations and left to the judgment of God.</h2>

<p>But we do not refuse the assistance of our ministry for the instruction of our little ones, who after being fed with milk desire to be satisfied with more solid food: and as we do not scorn the simple folk, so we will have no dealings with rebel <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, remembering the Lord's command, who says, <q>Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine <span class="stiki" id="note360600"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> .</q> Surely it is altogether unworthy and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> to admit to freedom of discussion men whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> describes in the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>the sons of the stranger have lied unto me. </q> For even though they resist not the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, yet they have shown themselves to be of those of whom it is written <q>they profess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God but by their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> they deny Him <span class="stiki" id="note360602"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse16">Titus&nbsp;1:16</a></span>,</q> while the blood of just Abel  still cries against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> Cain , who being rebuked by the Lord did not set quietly about his repentance but burst forth into <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Whose punishment we wish to be reserved for the Lord's judgment in such a way that, unprincipled plunderer and blood-thirsty murderer as he is, he may be thrown back upon himself and relinquish what is ours. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you also not to suffer the lamentable captivity of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">church of Alexandria</a> to be any further prolonged, which by the help of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and Justice ought to be restored to its liberty, that through all the cities of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> the dignity of the Fathers and their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> rights may be restored. Dated 21st of March in the consulship of Leo and Majorian Augusti (458).</p>
