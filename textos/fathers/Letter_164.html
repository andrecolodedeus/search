<h1>Letter 164</h1>

<p> <em>Second Epistle of the same to the same, expressing premature triumph in Victory.</em> </p>

<p>Through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> prince has granted us an audience, and by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we have got the better of our opponents, as all our views have been accepted by the most Christ-loving emperor. The reports of others were read, and what seemed unfit to be received, and had no further importance, he rejected. They were full of Cyril, and petitioned that he might be summoned to give an account of himself. So far they have not prevailed, but have heard discourses on <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, that is on the system of the Faith, and that the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the blessed Fathers was confirmed. We further refuted Acacius  who had laid down in his Commentaries that the Godhead is passible. At this our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor was so shocked at the enormity of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> that he flung off his mantle, and stepped back. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the whole assembly welcomed us as champions of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion.</p>

<p>It has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor that anyone should explain his own views, and report them to his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. We have replied that it is impossible for us to make any other exposition than that made by the blessed Fathers at Nic&aelig;a, and so it has pleased his majesty. We therefore offered the form subscribed by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Moreover, the whole population of Constantinople is continually coming out to us to implore us to fight manfully for the Faith. We do our best to restrain them, to avoid giving offense to our opponents. We have sent a copy of the expositing, that two copies may be made, and you may subscribe them both.</p>
