<h1>Letter 164</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Ascholius</em>. </p>

<p>1. It would not be easy for me to say how very much delighted I am with your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness's</a> letter. My words are too weak to express all that I feel; you, however, ought to be able to conjecture it, from the beauty of what you have written. For what did not your letter contain? It contained <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the marvellous description of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, which put the manner of their good fight so plainly before me that I seemed actually to see it; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and kindness to myself; words of surpassing beauty. So when I had taken it into my hands, and read it many times, and perceived how abundantly full it was of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, I thought that I had gone back to the good old times, when God's Churches flourished, rooted in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, united in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, all the members being in harmony, as though in one body. Then the persecutors were manifest, and manifest too the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>. Then the people grew more numerous by being attacked. Then the blood of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, watering the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, nourished many more champions of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, each generation stripping for the struggle with the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of those that had gone before. Then we <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> were in peace with one another, the peace which the Lord bequeathed us, of which, so cruelly have we driven it from among us, not a single trace is now left us. Yet my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> did go back to that blessedness of old, when a letter came from a long distance, bright with the beauty of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> travelled to me from wild regions beyond the Danube, preaching in his own person the exactitude of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is there observed. Who could tell the delight of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> at all this? What power of speech could be devised competent to describe all that I felt in the bottom of my heart? However, when I saw the athlete, I blessed his trainer: he, too, before the just Judge, after strengthening many for the conflict on behalf of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, shall receive the crown of righteousness.</p>

<p>2. By bringing the blessed Eutyches  to my recollection, and honouring my country for having sown the seeds of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, you have at once delighted me by your reminder of the past, and distressed me by your conviction of the present. None of us now comes near Eutyches in goodness: so far are we from bringing barbarians under the softening power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and the operation of His graces, that by the greatness of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> we turn gentle hearted men into barbarians, for to ourselves and to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> I attribute it that the influence of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is so widely diffused. Peradventure no part of the world has escaped the conflagration of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. You tell me of struggles of athletes, bodies lacerated for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> sake, savage fury despised by men of fearless heart, various tortures of persecutors, and constancy of the wrestlers through them all, the block and the water whereby the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> died.  And what is our condition? Love is grown cold; the teaching of the Fathers is being laid waste; everywhere is shipwreck of the Faith; the mouths of the Faithful are silent; the people, driven from the houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, lift up their hands in the open air to their Lord which is in heaven. Our afflictions are heavy, <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is nowhere to be seen, because those who evilly entreat us are called by the same name as ourselves. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the Lord yourself, and join all Christ's noble athletes with you in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, to the end that, if any further time remains for this world, and all things are not being driven to destruction, God may be reconciled to his own Churches and restore them to their ancient peace.</p>
