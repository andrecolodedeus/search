<h1>Letter 165</h1>

<p> <em>Letter of the same to the same.</em> </p>

<p>To the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> now in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>: Johannes, Himerius, Paulus, Apringius, Theodoretus, greeting. For the fifth time an audience has been granted us. We entered largely into the question of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Chapters, and swore again and again to the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor that it was impossible for us to hold communion with our opponents unless they rejected the Chapters. We pointed out moreover that even if Cyril did abjure his Chapters he could not be received by us, because he had become the heresiarch of so impious a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Nevertheless we gained no ground, because our adversaries were urgent, and their hearers could neither restrain them in their insolent endeavour, nor compel them to come to enquiry and argument. They thus evade the investigation of the Chapters, and allow no discussion concerning them. We, however, as you entreat, are ready to insist to the death. We refuse to receive Cyril and his Chapters; we will not admit these men to Communion till the improper additions to the Faith be rejected. We therefore implore your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to continue to show at once our mind and our efforts. The battle is for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion; for the only hope we have&mdash;on account of which we look forward to enjoying, in the world to come, the loving-kindness of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>. As to the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that we have tried to introduce a word about him, but have hitherto failed, because all are ill-affected toward him. We will notwithstanding do our best, though this is so, to take advantage of any opportunity that may offer, and of the goodwill of the audience, to carry out this purpose, God helping us. But that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> may not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this too, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we, seeing that the partisans of Cyril have deceived everyone by domineering, cheating, flattering, and bribing, have more than once besought the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor and most noble princes both to send us back to the East, and let your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> go home. For we are beginning to learn that we are wasting time in vain, without nearing our end, because Cyril everywhere shirks discussion, in his conviction that the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> published in his Twelve Chapters can be openly refuted. The very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor has determined, after many exhortations, that we all go every one to his own home, and that, further, both the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> and Memnon of Ephesus are to remain in their own places. So the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> will be able to go on blindfolding by <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribery</a>. The one, after crimes too many to tell, is to return to his diocese. The other, an innocent man, is barely permitted to go home. We and all here salute you and all the brotherhood with you.</p>
