<h1>Letter 166</h1>

<p>Leo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to Neo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Ravenna, greeting.</p>

<h2>I. Those, who being taken captives in infancy cannot remember or bring witnesses of their baptism, must not be denied this sacrament.</h2>

<p>We have indeed frequently, God's Spirit instructing us, steadied the brethren's hearts, when they were tottering on the slippery places of doubtful questions, by formulating an answer either out of the teaching of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> or from the rules of the Fathers: but lately in Synod a new and hitherto unheard-of subject of debate has arisen. For at the instance of certain brethren we have discovered that some of the prisoners of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, on their free return to their own homes, such to wit as went into captivity at an age when they could have no sure <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of anything, crave the healing waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but in the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of infancy cannot remember whether they have received the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and that therefore in this uncertainty of defective recollection their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are brought into jeopardy, so long as under a show of caution they are denied a <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, which is withheld, because it is thought to have been bestowed. And so, since certain brethren in a not unjustifiable <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> have hesitated to perform the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the Lord's <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, at a synodal meeting, as we have said, we have received a formal request for advice on this matter, and in carefully discussing it, we have desired to weigh each members opinion, and to handle it in so cautious a manner as to arrive with certainty at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by making use of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of many. Consequently the same things, which have come into our mind by the Divine inspiration, have received the assent and confirmation of a large number of the brethren. And so we are bound before all things to take heed lest, while we hold fast to a certain show of caution, we incur a loss of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> who are to be regenerated. For who is so given over to suspicions as to decide that to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which without any evidence he suspects by mere guesswork? And so wherever the man himself who is anxious for the new birth does not recollect his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and no one can bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> about him being unaware of his consecration to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, there is no possibility for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to creep in, seeing that, so far as their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> goes, neither the bestower or receiver of the consecration is guilty. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed that an unpardonable offense is committed, whenever in accordance with the institutions of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers have condemned, any one is forced twice to enter the font, which is but once available for those who are to be reborn, in opposition to the Apostle's teaching , which speaks to us of One Godhead in Trinity, one confession in Faith, one sacrament in Baptism. But in this nothing similar is to be apprehended, since, what is not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been done at all, cannot come under the charge of repetition. And so, whenever such a case occurs, first sift it by careful investigation, and spend a considerable time, unless his last end is near, in inquiring whether there be absolutely no one who by his testimony can assist the other's <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. And when it is established that the man who requires the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is prevented by a mere baseless suspicion, let him come boldly to obtain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, of which he is conscious of no trace in himself. Nor need we <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> thus to open the door of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which has not been shown to have been entered before.</p>

<h2>II. Baptism by heretics must not be invalidated by second baptism.</h2>

<p>But if it is established that a man has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, on him the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of regeneration must in no way be repeated, but only that conferred which was wanting before, so that he may obtain the power of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> by the laying on of the Bishop's hands.  This decision, beloved brother, we wish to be brought to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of you all generally, to the end that God's mercy may not be refused to those who desire to be saved through undue timidity. Dated the 24th of Oct., in the consulship of Majorian Augustus (458).</p>
