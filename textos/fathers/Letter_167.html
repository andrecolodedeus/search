<h1>Letter 167</h1>

<p> <em>Second Petition of the same, sent from Chalcedon to Theodosius Augustus.</em></p>

<p>Your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> has been informed on several occasions, both by ourselves in person and by our emissaries, that the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> seems to stand in danger of being corrupted, and that the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is apparently being rent asunder by men who are turning everything upside down, trampling upon all church order, and all imperial law, and throwing everything into confusion that they may confirm the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> propounded by Cyril of Alexandria. For when we were first summoned by your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a>, to enquire into the question which had arisen and to confirm the evangelic and apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> laid down by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, before the arrival of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had been convened, the holders of their own private Council confirmed in writing the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Chapters, which are at one with the impiety of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, Eunomius and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>. Some they deceived; some they terrified; others already charged with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, they received into communion; and others who had not communicated with them were <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a> into so doing; others again were fired with the hope of dignities for which they were unfit; so these men gathered round them a great crowd of adherents, as though they had no idea that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion is shown not by numbers, but by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>The dispatch of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> was read a second time by the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Count Candidianus, ordering that the questions recently raised be examined in a quiet and brotherly manner. When however all the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were assembling, the reading had no effect.</p>

<p>Then came the noble Palladius Magistrianus, bringing another dispatch from your majesty, to the effect that all enactments passed privately and apart must be rescinded; that the Council must be assembled afresh and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine ratified; but, as usual, this your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mandate was treated with contempt by these unscrupulous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<p>Then again arrived the right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Master John, at that time <q>Comes Largitionum,</q> bringing another <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> letter to the effect that the depositions of the three had been decreed, that the offenses which had sprung up were to be removed, and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> laid down at Nic&aelig;a by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Fathers was to be ratified by all. As usual these universal mockers transgressed this law too.</p>

<p>For after hearing the letter they did not change their mode of action; they held communion with the deposed; spoke of them as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and refused to allow the Chapters, which had been propounded to the loss and corruption of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be rejected; notwithstanding their having been frequently summoned by us to discussion. For we had ready to hand a plain refutation of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Chapters.</p>

<p>In evidence of these statements we have the right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Master, who when both sides had been summoned a third and a fourth time, not venturing to make this conduct an excuse on account of their disobedience, thought it worth while to summon us hither.</p>

<p>We came at once; on our arrival we allowed ourselves no rest making our petition, both before your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and before the illustrious assembly, that they would take up the quarrel for the Chapters and enter into discussion concerning them, or on the other hand reject them as contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, abiding by the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as laid down by the blessed fathers in council at Nic&aelig;a.</p>

<p>They refused to do anything of the kind; they persisted in their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> procedure; yet they were allowed to attend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and to perform their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions. We, however, alike at Ephesus and here, have been for a long time deprived of communion; alike there and here we have undergone innumerable perils; and while we were being <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> and all but slain by slaves dressed up as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, we took it all for the best, as willingly enduring such treatment in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>Afterwards it seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to your majesty that we and the opposite party should assemble once again, that the recalcitrant might be compelled to examine the doctrines. While we were waiting for this to come to pass your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> set out for the city, and ordered the very men who were being accused of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and had been therefore some of them deposed by us, and others <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> and thereafter to be subjected to the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to come to the city and perform <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions, and ordain.  We however who in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion have undertaken a struggle so tremendous; we who have shrunk from no peril in our battle for right doctrine, have neither been bidden to enter the city to serve the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the imperilled Faith and strive for <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>; nor have we been permitted to return home;  but here we are in Chalcedon distressed and groaning for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> oppressed by <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.</p>

<p>Wherefore since we are in receipt of no reply we have thought it necessary to inform your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> by this present letter, before God and Christ and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, that if any one shall have been ordained (before the settlement of right doctrines) by these men of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions, he must necessarily be cut off from the whole church, as well from the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> as the dissentient <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. For none of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> will endure that communion be granted to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and their own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> be nullified.</p>

<p>And when this shall have come to pass, then your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> shall be compelled to act against your will. For the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> will grow beyond all expectation, and thereby the champions of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion will be saddened, unable to endure the loss of their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the establishment of those impious doctrines of Cyril which the contentious are desirous of defending.</p>

<p>Many indeed of the supporters of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion will never allow the acceptance of Cyril's doctrines; we shall never allow it, who all are of the diocese of the East of your province, of the diocese of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, of Asia, of Thrace, of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a> and of the Italies, and who also sent to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> the treatise of the most blessed Ambrose, written against this nascent <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>.</p>

<p>To avoid all this, and the further troubling of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, we beg, beseech, and implore you to issue an edict that no ordination take place before the settlement of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, on account of which we have been convened by your Christ-loving highness.</p>
