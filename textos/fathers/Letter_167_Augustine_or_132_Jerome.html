<h1>Letter 167 (Augustine) or 132 (Jerome)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">From Augustine to Jerome, on James 2:10 (A.D. 415)</span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. My brother Jerome, esteemed worthy to be honoured in Christ by me, when I wrote to you propounding this question concerning the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>&mdash;if a new <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be now created for each individual at birth, whence do <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> contract the bond of guilt which we assuredly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be removed by the sacrament of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when administered even to new-born children?&mdash; as the letter on that subject grew to the size of a considerable volume, I was unwilling to impose the burden of any other question at that time; but there is a subject which has a much stronger claim on my attention, as it presses more seriously on my mind. I therefore ask you, and in God's name beseech you, to do something which will, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, be of great service to many, namely, to explain to me (or to direct me to any work in which you or any other commentator has already expounded) the sense in which we are to understand these words in the Epistle of James, <q>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112746"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse10">James&nbsp;2:10</a></span> This subject is of such importance that I very greatly regret that I did not write to you in regard to it long ago.</p>

<p>2. For whereas in the question which I thought it necessary to submit to you concerning the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, our inquiries were engaged with the investigation of a life wholly past and sunk out of sight in oblivion, in this question we study this present life, and how it must be spent if we would attain to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. As an apt illustration of this remark let me quote an entertaining anecdote. A man had fallen into a well where the quantity of water was sufficient to break his fall and save him from death, but not deep enough to cover his mouth and deprive him of speech. Another man approached, and on seeing him cries out in surprise: <q>How did you fall in here?</q> He answers: <q>I beseech you to plan how you can get me out of this, rather than ask how I fell in.</q> So, since we admit and hold as an article of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of even a little infant requires to be delivered out of the guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as out of a pit, by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it is sufficient for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of such a one that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the way in which it is saved, even though we should never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the way in which it came into that wretched condition. But I thought it our duty to inquire into this subject, lest we should incautiously hold any one of those opinions concerning the manner of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> becoming united with the body which might contradict the doctrine that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of little children require to be delivered, by denying that they are subject to the bond of guilt. This, then, being very firmly held by us, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of every infant needs to be freed from the guilt of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and can be freed in no other way except by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, if we can ascertain the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and origin of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> itself, we are better prepared and equipped for resisting adversaries whose empty talk I call not reasoning but quibbling; if, however, we cannot ascertain the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, the fact that the origin of this misery is hid from us is no reason for our being <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> in the work which compassion demands from us. In our conflict, however, with those who appear to themselves to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, we have an additional strength and safety in not being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of our <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> on this subject. For there are some things which it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; there are other things which cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, or are not necessary to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, or have no bearing on the life which we seek to obtain; but the question which I now submit to you from the writings of the Apostle James is intimately connected with the course of conduct in which we live, and in which, with a view to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, we endeavour to please God.</p>

<p>3. How, then, I beseech you, are we to understand the words: <q>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all</q>? Does this affirm that the person who shall have committed theft, nay, who even shall have said to the rich man, <q>Sit here</q> and to the poor man, <q>Stand there,</q> is guilty of homicide, and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and sacrilege? And if he is not so, how can it be said that a person who has offended in one point has become guilty of all? Or are the things which the apostle said concerning the rich man and the poor man not to be reckoned among those things in one of which if any man offend he becomes guilty of all? But we must remember whence that sentence is taken, and what goes before it, and in what connection it occurs. <q>My brethren,</q> he says, <q>have not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Lord of Glory, with respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For if there come into your assembly a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man in vile raiment; and you have respect to him that wears the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit here in a good place; and say to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, Stand there, or sit here under my footstool; are you not then partial in yourselves, and have become judges of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts? Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and heirs of the kingdom which He has promised to them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him? But you have despised the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112747"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse1">James&nbsp;2:1-6</a></span> &mdash; inasmuch as you have said to the poor man, <q>Stand there,</q> when you would have said to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with a gold ring, <q>Sit here in a good place.</q> And then there follows a passage explaining and enlarging upon that same conclusion: <q>Do not rich men oppress you by their power, and draw you before the judgment-seats? Do not they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> that worthy name by the which you are called? If you fulfil the royal law according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself, you do well: but if you have respect to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, you commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112748"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse6">James&nbsp;2:6-9</a></span> See how the apostle calls those transgressors of the law who say to the rich man, <q>Sit here,</q> and to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, <q>Stand there.</q> See how, lest they should think it a trifling <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to transgress the law in this one thing, he goes on to add: <q>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all. For He that said, Do not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, said also, Do not kill. Now if you do not kill, yet, if you commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, you have become a transgressor of the law,</q> according to that which he had said: <q>You are convinced of the law as transgressors.</q> Since these things are so, it seems to follow, unless it can be shown that we are to understand it in some other way, that he who says to the rich man, <q>Sit here,</q> and to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, <q>Stand there,</q> not treating the one with the same respect as the other, is to be judged guilty as an idolater, and a blasphemer, and an adulterer, and a murderer&mdash; in short&mdash;not to enumerate all, which would be tedious&mdash;as guilty of all crimes, since, offending in one, he is guilty of all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>4. But has he who has one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>? And has he no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> who lacks one? If this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, the sentence of the apostle is thereby confirmed. But what I desire is to have the sentence explained, not confirmed, since of itself it stands more sure in our esteem than all the authority of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> could make it. And even if what has just been said concerning <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, it would not follow that therefore all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal. For as to the inseparable co-existence of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, this is a doctrine in regard to which, if I remember rightly, what, indeed, I have almost forgotten (though perhaps I am mistaken), all <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> who affirm that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are essential to the right conduct of life are agreed. The doctrine of the equality of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, however, the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a> alone dared to maintain in opposition to the unanimous sentiments of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>: an absurd tenet, which in writing against Jovinianus (a Stoic in this opinion, but an Epicurean in following after and defending pleasure) you have most clearly refuted from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>.  In that most delightful and noble dissertation you have made it abundantly plain that it has not been the doctrine of our authors, or rather of the Truth Himself, who has spoken through them, that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal. I shall now do my utmost in endeavouring, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to show how it can be that, although the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> concerning <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, we are nevertheless not compelled to admit the <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics'</a> doctrine that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal. If I succeed, I will look for your approbation, and in whatever respect I come short, I beg you to supply my deficiencies.</p>

<p>5. Those who maintain that he who has one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has all, and that he who lacks one lacks all, reason correctly from the fact that <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> cannot be cowardly, nor <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, nor intemperate; for if it were any of these it would no longer be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. Moreover, if it be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> only when it is brave, and just, and temperate, assuredly wherever it exists it must have the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> along with it. In like manner, also, <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> cannot be imprudent, or intemperate, or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> must of necessity be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, brave, and just; and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> does not exist unless it be <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, brave, and temperate. Thus, wherever any one of these <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> exists, the others likewise exist; and where some are absent, that which may appear in some measure to resemble <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is not really present.</p>

<p>6. There are, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> by a palpable contrast, as imprudence is the opposite of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. But there are some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> opposed to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> simply because they are <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> which, nevertheless, by a deceitful appearance resemble <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; as, for example, in the relation, not of imprudence, but of craftiness to the said <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>. I speak here of that craftiness  which is wont to be understood and spoken of in connection with the evilly disposed, not in the sense in which the word is usually employed in our Scriptures, where it is often used in a good sense, as, <q>Be crafty as serpents,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112751"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> and again, to give craftiness to the simple. <span class="stiki" id="note112752"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse4">Proverbs&nbsp;1:4</a></span> It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that among <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> writers one of the most accomplished of Latin authors, speaking of Catiline, has said: <q>Nor was there lacking on his part craftiness to guard against danger,</q>  using <q>craftiness</q> (astutia) in a good sense; but the use of the word in this sense is among them very rare, among us very common. So also in regard to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> classed under <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>. Extravagance is most manifestly opposite to the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of frugality; but that which the common people are wont to call niggardliness is indeed a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, yet one which, not in its nature, but by a very deceitful similarity of appearance, usurps the name of frugality. In the same manner <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> is by a palpable contrast opposed to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>; but the desire of avenging oneself is wont often to be a counterfeit of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but it is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. There is an obvious contrariety between <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and cowardice; but hardihood, though differing from <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in nature, deceives us by its resemblance to that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Firmness is a part of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; fickleness is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> far removed from and undoubtedly opposed to it; but obstinacy lays claim to the name of firmness, yet is wholly different, because firmness is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and obstinacy is a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>.</p>

<p>7. To avoid the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of again going over the same ground, let us take one case as an example, from which all others may be understood. Catiline, as those who have written concerning him had means of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, was capable of enduring cold, thirst, hunger, and patient in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, cold, and watchings beyond what any one could <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and thus he appeared, both to himself and to his followers, a man endowed with great <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>.  But this <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> was not <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, for he chose the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> instead of the good; was not temperate, for his life was disgraced by the lowest dissipation; was not just, for he conspired against his country; and therefore it was not <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, but hardihood usurping the name of <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to deceive fools; for if it had been <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, it would not have been a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> but a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and if it had been a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it would never have been abandoned by the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, its inseparable companions.</p>

<p>8. On this account, when it is asked also concerning <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, whether where one exists all in like manner exist, or where one does not exist none exist, it would be a difficult matter to show this, because two <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are wont to be opposed to one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, one that is evidently opposed, and another that bears an apparent likeness. Hence the hardihood of Catiline is the more easily seen not to have been <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, since it had not along with it other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>; but it may be difficult to convince men that his hardihood was cowardice, since he was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of enduring and patiently submitting to the severest hardships to a degree almost incredible. But perhaps, on examining the matter more closely, this hardihood itself is seen to be cowardice, because he shrunk from the toil of those liberal studies by which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> is acquired. Nevertheless, as there are rash men who are not guilty of cowardice, and there are cowardly men who are not guilty of rashness, and since in both there is <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> brave man neither ventures rashly nor fears without reason, we are forced to admit that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are more numerous than <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>.</p>

<p>9. Accordingly, it happens sometimes that one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> is supplanted by another, as the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of praise. Occasionally, one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> quits the field that more may take its place, as in the case of the drunkard, who, after becoming temperate in the use of drink, may come under the power of niggardliness and ambition. It is possible, therefore, that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> may give place to <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, not to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, as their successors, and thus they are more numerous. When one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, however, has entered, there will infallibly be (since it brings all the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> along with it) a retreat of all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> whatsoever that were in the man; for all <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> were not in him, but at one time so many, at another a greater or smaller number might occupy their place.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>10. We must inquire more carefully whether these things are so; for the statement that <q>he who has one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has all, and that all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are awanting to him who lacks one,</q> is not given by inspiration, but is the view held by many men, ingenious, indeed, and studious, but still men. But I must avow that, in the case&mdash; I shall not say of one of those from whose name the word <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is said to be derived,  but even of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is faithful to her husband, and who is so from a regard to the commandments and promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and, first of all, is faithful to Him, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how I could say of her that she is unchaste, or that <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or a trifling one. I should feel the same in regard to a husband who is faithful to his wife; and yet there are many such, none of whom I could affirm to be without any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and doubtless the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is in them, whatever it be, proceeds from some <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Whence it follows that though conjugal fidelity in religious men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is undoubtedly a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, for it is neither a nonentity nor a <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, yet it does not bring along with it all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for if all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> were there, there would be no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and if there were no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, there would be no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but where is the man who is altogether without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Where, therefore, is the man who is without any <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, that is, fuel or root, as it were, of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when he who reclined on the breast of the Lord says, <q>If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note112756"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> It is not necessary for us to urge this at greater length in writing to you, but I make the statement for the sake of others who perhaps shall read this. For you, indeed, in that same splendid work against Jovinianus, have carefully <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> this from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>; in which work also you have quoted the words, <q>in many things we all offend,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112757"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James&nbsp;3:2</a></span> from this very epistle in which occur the words whose meaning we are now investigating. For though it is an apostle of Christ who is speaking, he does not say, <q>ye offend,</q> but, <q>we offend;</q> and although in the passage under consideration he says, <q>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112758"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse10">James&nbsp;2:10</a></span> in the words just quoted he affirms that we offend not in one thing but in <em>many</em>, and not that some offend but that we <em>all</em> offend.</p>

<p>11. Far be it, however, from any believer to think that so many thousands of the servants of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who, lest they should deceive themselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> should not be in them, sincerely confess themselves to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, are altogether without <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>! For wisdom is a great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and wisdom herself has said to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <q>Behold the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, that is wisdom.</q>  Far be it from us, then, to say that so many and so great believing and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men have not the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, which the Greeks call <span class="greek">&#x03B5;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span>, or more literally and fully, <span class="greek">&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x1F73;&#x03B2;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;</span> . And what is the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord but His worship? And whence is He <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> worshipped except from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Love, then, out of a pure heart, and a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned, is the great and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, because it is <q>the end of the commandment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112760"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> Deservedly is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> said to be <q>strong as death,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112761"><a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse6">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;8:6</a></span> because, like death, it is vanquished by none; or because the measure of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in this life is even unto death, as the Lord says, <q>Greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112762"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;15:13</a></span> or, rather, because, as death forcibly separates the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from the senses of the body, so <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> separates it from fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. Knowledge, when it is of the right kind, is the handmaid to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for without <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <q><a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> puffs up,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112763"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:1</a></span> but where <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, by edifying, has filled the heart, there <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> will find nothing empty which it can puff up. Moreover, Job has shown, what is that useful <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by defining it where, after saying, <q>The <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord, that is wisdom</q> he adds <q>and to depart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that is understanding.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112764"><a href="../bible/job028.htm#verse28">Job&nbsp;28:28</a></span> Why do we not then say that the man who has this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, since <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the fulfilling of the law?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112765"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> Is it not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, the more <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> exists in a man the more he is endowed with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and the less <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he has the less <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is in him, for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is itself <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and the less <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> there is in a man so much the more <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> will there be in him? Therefore, where <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is full and perfect, no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> will remain.</p>

<p>12. The <a href="../cathen/14299a.htm">Stoics</a>, therefore, appear to me to be mistaken in refusing to admit that a man who is advancing in wisdom has any wisdom at all, and in affirming that he alone has it who has become altogether perfect in wisdom. They do not, indeed, deny that he has made progress, but they say that he is in no degree entitled to be called wise, unless, by emerging, so to speak, from the depths, he suddenly springs forth into the free air of wisdom. For, as it matters not when a man is drowning whether the depth of water above him be many stadia or only the breadth of a hand or finger, so they say in regard to the progress of those who are advancing towards wisdom, that they are like men rising from the bottom of a whirlpool towards the air, but that unless they by their progress, so escape as to emerge wholly from folly as from an overwhelming flood, they have not <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and are not wise; but that, when they have so escaped, they immediately have wisdom in perfection, and not a vestige of folly whence any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> could be originated remains.</p>

<p>13. This simile, in which folly is compared to water and wisdom to air, so that the mind emerging, as it were, from the stifling influence of folly breathes suddenly the free air of wisdom, does not appear to me to harmonize sufficiently with the authoritative statement of our Scriptures; a better simile, so far, at least, as illustration of spiritual things can be borrowed from material things, is that which compares <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> or folly to darkness, and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> or wisdom to light. The way to wisdom is therefore not like that of a man rising from the water into the air, in which, in the moment of rising above the surface of the water, he suddenly breathes freely, but, like that of a man proceeding from darkness into light, on whom more light gradually shines as he advances. So long, therefore, as this is not fully accomplished, we speak of the man as of one going from the dark recesses of a vast cavern towards its entrance, who is more and more influenced by the proximity of the light as he comes nearer to the entrance of the cavern; so that whatever light he has proceeds from the light to which he is advancing, and whatever darkness still remains in him proceeds from the darkness out of which he is emerging. Therefore it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that in the sight of God <q>shall no man living be justified,</q>  and yet that <q>the just shall live by his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112767"><a href="../bible/hab002.htm#verse4">Habakkuk&nbsp;2:4</a></span> On the one hand, <q>the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are clothed with righteousness,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112768"><a href="../bible/job029.htm#verse14">Job&nbsp;29:14</a></span> one more, another less; on the other hand, no one lives here wholly without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more, another less, and the best is the man who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> least.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>14. But why have I, as if forgetting to whom I address myself, assumed the tone of a teacher in stating the question regarding which I wish to be instructed by you? Nevertheless, as I had resolved to submit to your examination my opinion regarding the equality of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (a subject involving a question closely bearing on the matter on which I was writing), let me now at last bring my statement to a conclusion. Even though it were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he who has one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has all <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and that he who lacks one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has none, this would not involve the consequence that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are equal; for although it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that where there is no <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> there is nothing right, it by no means follows that among bad actions one cannot be worse than another, or that divergence from that which is right does not admit of degrees. I think, however, that it is more agreeable to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and consistent with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> to say, that what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the members of the body is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of the different dispositions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (which, though not seen occupying different places, are by their distinctive workings perceived as plainly as the members of the body), namely, that as in the same body one member is more fully shone upon by the light, another is less shone upon, and a third is altogether without light, and remains in the dark under some impervious covering, something similar takes place in regard to the various dispositions of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. If this be so, then according to the manner in which every man is shone upon by the light of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, he may be said to have one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and to lack another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or to have one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in larger and another in smaller measure. For in reference to that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we may correctly say both that it is greater in one man than in another, and that there is some of it in one man, and none of it in another; we may also correctly say as to an individual that he has greater <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> than patience, and that he has either <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in a higher degree than he had yesterday, if he is making progress, or that he still lacks self-control, but possesses, at the same time, a large measure of compassion.</p>

<p>15. To sum up generally and briefly the view which, so far as relates to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> living, I entertain concerning <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>&mdash;<a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with which that which ought to be loved is loved. This is in some greater, in others less, and there are men in whom it does not exist at all; but in the absolute fullness which admits of no increase, it exists in no man while living on this earth; so long, however, as it admits of being increased there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that, in so far as it is less than it ought to be, the shortcoming proceeds from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Because of this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> there is <q>not a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man upon earth that does good and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112769"><a href="../bible/ecc005.htm#verse7">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;5:7</a></span> because of this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, <q>in God's sight shall no man living be justified.</q>  On account of this <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, <q>if we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112771"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> On account of this also, whatever progress we may have made, we must say, <q>Forgive us our debts,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112772"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> although all debts in word, deed, and thought were washed away in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. He, then, who sees aright, sees whence, and when, and where he must hope for that perfection to which nothing can be added. Moreover, if there had been no commandments, there would have been no means whereby a man might certainly examine himself and see from what things he ought to turn aside, whither he should aspire, and in what things he should find occasion for thanksgiving or for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Great, therefore, is the benefit of commandments, if to <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> so much liberty be granted that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God may be more abundantly honoured.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>16. If these things be so, how shall a man who shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, be guilty of all? May it not be, that since the fulfilling of the law is that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> wherewith we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God and our neighbour, on which commandments of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <q>hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112773"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;22:40</a></span> he is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> held to be guilty of all who violates that on which all hang? Now, no one <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without violating this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <q>for this, you shall not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; you shall do no <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>; you shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>; you shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself. Love works no ill to his neighbour: therefore <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is the fulfilling of the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112774"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;13:9-10</a></span> No one, however, loves his neighbour who does not out of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to God do all in his power to bring his neighbour also, whom he loves as himself, to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom if he does not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, he neither loves himself nor his neighbour. Hence it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that if a man shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he becomes guilty of all, because he does what is contrary to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> on which hangs the whole law. A man, therefore, becomes guilty of all by doing what is contrary to that on which all hang.</p>

<p>17. Why, then, may not all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> be said to be equal? May not the reason be, that the transgression of the law of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is greater in him who commits a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and is less in him who commits a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? And in the mere fact of his committing any <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> whatever, he becomes guilty of all; but in committing a more grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or in sinning in more respects than one, he becomes more guilty; committing a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, or sinning in fewer respects, he becomes less guilty&mdash;his guilt being thus so much the greater the more he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, the less the less he has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Nevertheless, even though it be only in one point that he offend, he is guilty of all, because he violates that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> on which all hang. If these things be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, an explanation is by this means found, clearing up that saying of the man of apostolic <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, <q>In many things we offend all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112775"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse2">James&nbsp;3:2</a></span> For we all offend, but one more grievously, another more slightly, according as each may have committed a more grievous or a less grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; every one being great in the practice of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in proportion as he is deficient in loving God and his neighbour, and, on the other hand, decreasing in the practice of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in proportion as he increases in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of his neighbour. The more, therefore, that a man is deficient in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the more is he full of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. And perfection in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is reached when nothing of sinful infirmity remains in us.</p>

<p>18. Nor, indeed, in my opinion, are we to esteem it a trifling <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> <q>to have the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> with respect of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>,</q> if we take the difference between sitting and standing, of which mention is made in the context, to refer to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> honours; for who can bear to see a rich man chosen to a place of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while a <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a> man, of superior qualifications and of greater <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, is despised? If, however, the apostle speaks there of our daily assemblies, who does not offend in the matter? At the same time, only those really offend here who cherish in their hearts the opinion that a man's worth is to be estimated according to his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; for this seems to be the meaning of the expression, <q>Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and have become judges of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts?</q></p>

<p>19. The law of liberty, therefore, the law of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, is that of which he says: If you fulfil the royal law according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, You shall <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself, you do well: but if you have respect to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, you commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and are convinced of the law as transgressors. <span class="stiki" id="note112776"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse8">James&nbsp;2:8-9</a></span> And then (after the difficult sentence, <q>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all,</q> concerning which I have with sufficient fullness stated my opinion), making mention of the same law of liberty, he says: <q>So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</q> And as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> by experience what he had said a little before, <q>in many things we offend all,</q> he suggests a sovereign remedy, to be applied, as it were day by day, to those less serious but real wounds which the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> suffers day by day, for he says: <q>He shall have judgment without mercy that has showed no mercy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112777"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse13">James&nbsp;2:13</a></span> For with the same purpose the Lord says: <q>Forgive, and you shall be forgiven: give, and it shall be given unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112778"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse37">Luke&nbsp;6:37-38</a></span> After which the apostle says: <q>But mercy rejoices over judgment:</q> it is not said that mercy prevails over judgment, for it is not an adversary of judgment, but it <q>rejoices</q> over judgment, because a greater number are gathered in by mercy; but they are those who have shown mercy, for, <q>Blessed are the merciful, for God shall have mercy on them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112779"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;5:7</a></span> </p>

<p>20. It is, therefore, by all means just that they be forgiven, because they have forgiven others, and that what they need be given to them, because they have given to others. For God uses mercy when He judges, and uses judgment when He shows mercy. Hence the Psalmist says: <q>I will sing of mercy and of judgment unto You, O Lord.</q>  For if any man, thinking himself too righteous to require mercy, presumes, as if he had no reason for anxiety, to wait for judgment without mercy, he provokes that most righteous indignation through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of which the Psalmist said: <q>Enter not into judgment with Your servant.</q>  For this reason the Lord says to a disobedient people: Wherefore will you contend with me in judgment?  For when the righteous King shall sit upon His throne, who shall boast that he has a pure heart, or who shall boast that he is clean from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? What hope is there then unless mercy shall <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over</q> judgment? But this it will do only in the case of those who have showed mercy, saying with sincerity, <q>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</q> and who have given without murmuring, for <q>the Lord loves a cheerful giver.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112783"><a href="../bible/2co009.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:7</a></span> To conclude, St. James is led to speak thus concerning works of mercy in this passage, in order that he may console those whom the statements immediately foregoing might have greatly alarmed, his purpose being to admonish us how those daily <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> from which our life is never free here below may also be expiated by daily remedies; lest any man, becoming guilty of all when he offends in even one point, be brought, by offending in many points (since <q>in many things we all offend</q>), to appear before the bar of the Supreme Judge under the enormous amount of guilt which has accumulated by degrees, and find at that tribunal no mercy, because he showed no mercy to others, instead of rather meriting the forgiveness of his own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and the enjoyment of the gifts promised in Scripture, by his extending forgiveness and bounty to others.</p>

<p>21. I have written at great length, which may perhaps have been tedious to you, as you, although approving of the statements now made, do not expect to be addressed as if you were but learning truths which you have been accustomed to teach to others. If, however, there be anything in these statements&mdash; not in the style of language in which they are expounded, for I am not much concerned as to mere phrases, but in the substance of the statements&mdash; which your erudite judgment condemns, I beseech you to point this out to me in your reply, and do not hesitate to correct my <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For I pity the man who, in view of the unwearied labour and sacred character of your studies, does not on account of them both render to you the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which you deserve, and give thanks unto our Lord God by whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you are what you are. Wherefore, since I ought to be more willing to learn from any teacher the things of which to my disadvantage I am <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, than prompt to teach any others what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, with how much greater reason do I claim the payment of this debt of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from you, by whose learning <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> literature in the Latin tongue has been, in the Lord's name, and by His help, advanced to an extent which had been previously unattainable. Especially, however, I ask attention to the sentence: <q>Whosoever shall keep the whole law, and offend in one point, is guilty of all.</q> If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> any better way, my beloved brother, in which it can be explained, I beseech you by the Lord to favour us by communicating to us your exposition.</p>
