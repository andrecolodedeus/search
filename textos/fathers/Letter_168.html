<h1>Letter 168</h1>

<p> <em>Third Demand of the same, addressed from Chalcedon to the Sovereigns.</em></p>

<p>We never expected the summons of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to meet with this result. We were honourably convoked, as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> by prince; we were convoked to ratify the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers; and therefore, in due <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> prince, we came. On our arrival we were no less faithful to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not less respectful to your edict. From the day of our arrival at Ephesus till the present moment we have without intermission followed your behests.</p>

<p>As it seems, however, our moderation, in these times, has not been of the slightest use to us; nay, rather, so far as we can see, it has stood very much in our way. We indeed who have thus behaved have been up to the present time detained in Chalcedon; and now we are told that we may go home. They however who have thrown everything into confusion, who have filled the world with tumult, who are striving to rend churches in two, and who are the open assailants of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, perform <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions, crowd the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and as they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> have authority to ordain, though in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> it is illegally claimed by them, stir up seditions in the church, and what ought to be spent upon the poor they throw away upon their bullies.</p>

<p>But you are not only their emperor; you are ours too. For no small portion of your empire is the East, wherein the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> has ever shone, and, besides, the other provinces and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a> from which we have been convened.</p>

<p>Let not your majesty despise the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is being corrupted, in which you and your forefathers have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; on which the Church's foundations are laid; for which most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> have rejoiced to suffer countless kinds of death; by aid of which you have vanquished barbarians and destroyed tyrants; which you are needing now in your <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for the subjugation of Africa. For on your side will fight the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all if you struggle on behalf of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> doctrines and forbid the dismemberment of the body of the church: for dismembered it will be if the opinion prevail which Cyril has introduced into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have confirmed.</p>

<p>To these truths we have often already borne testimony before God both in <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> and in this place. I have furnished information to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, giving an account as before the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all. For this is required of us, as is taught in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> both by <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; as says the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> <q>I give you charge in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who quickens the dead, and of Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, who before <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a> witnessed a good confession;</q>  and as God charged Ezekiel to announce to the people, adding threats and saying, <q>when you give him not warning,...his blood will I require at your hand.</q> </p>

<p>In awe of this sentence, once again we inform your majesty that they who have been permitted to hold churches, and who teach the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and Eunomius, perform all sacred functions irregularly and in violation of the canons, and destroy the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all who approach them; if, indeed, any shall be found willing to listen to them. For by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God whose Providence is over all, and who wishes all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved, the more part of the people is sound, and warmly attached to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> doctrines. It is on their account that we grieve.</p>

<p>And in our anguish and alarm lest the plague creeping on little by little should attack more, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> become general, we thus instruct your serenity, and continue to give you exhortation; we implore your majesty to yield to our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and to prohibit any addition to be made to the Faith of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers assembled in council at Nic&aelig;a.</p>

<p>And if after this our entreaty your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> reject this doctrine, which was given in the presence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we will shake off the dust of our feet against you, and cry with the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, <q>We are pure from your blood.</q>  For we cease not night and day from the moment of our arrival at this distinguished council to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to prince, nobles, soldiers, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and people, that we hold fast the Faith delivered to us by the Fathers.</p>
