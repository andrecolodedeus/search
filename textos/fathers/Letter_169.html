<h1>Letter 169</h1>

<p> <em>Letter written by Theodoretus, Bishop of Cyrus, from Chalcedon to Alexander of Hierapolis.</em> </p>

<p>We have left no means untried, of courtesy, of sternness, of entreaty, of eloquence before the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor, and the illustrious assembly, testifying before God who sees all things and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> who shall judge the world in <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>,  and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and his elect <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, lest the Faith be despised which is now being corrupted by the maintainers and bold subscribers of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> doctrines: and that charge be given for it to be laid down in the same terms as at Nic&aelig;a and for the rejection of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> introduced to the loss and ruin of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Up to this time however we have produced not the slightest effect, our hearers being carried now in one direction and now in another.</p>

<p>Nevertheless all these difficulties have not been able to deter me from urging my point, but by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> I have pressed on. I have even stated to our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that it is perfectly impossible for Cyril and Memnon to be reconciled with me, and that we can never communicate with any one who has not previously repudiated the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Chapters. This then is our mind. The object of men who <q>seek their own not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s</q>  is to be reconciled with them against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. But this is no business of mine, for God weighs our motives and tries our character, nor does He inflict chastisement for what is done against our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. Be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that if ever I said a word about our friend  either before the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor or the illustrious assembly, I was at once branded as a rebel. So intensely is he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> by the court party. This is most annoying. The most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor, especially, cannot bear to hear his name mentioned and says publicly <q>Let no one speak to me of this man.</q> On one occasion he gave an instance of this to me. Nevertheless as long as I am here I shall not cease to serve the interests of this our father, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the impious have done him wrong.</p>

<p>My desire is that both your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and I myself get quit of this. No good is to be hoped from it, in as much as all the judges trust in gold, and contend that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the Godhead and manhood is one.</p>

<p>All the people however by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are in good case, and constantly come out to us. I have begun to discourse to them and have celebrated very large communions.</p>

<p>On the fourth occasion I spoke at length about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and they listened with such delight that they did not go away till the seventh hour but held out even till the midday heat. An enormous crowd was gathered in a great court, with four verandahs, and I preached from above from a platform near the roof.</p>

<p>All the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> with the excellent <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are on the contrary utterly opposed to me, so that when we came back from the Rufinianum, after the visit of the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor, stone throwing began and many of my companions were wounded, by the people and false <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.</p>

<p>The very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the mob was gathered against me and coming up to me alone he said, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are assembling improperly.</q> Then, said I, <q>As you have allowed me to speak hear me with favour. Is it fair for <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to be doing duty in churches, while I, who am fighting for the Faith and am therefore excluded by others from communion, am not allowed to enter a church?</q> He replied <q>What am I to do?</q> I said, <q>What your <em>comes largitionum</em> did at Ephesus. When he found that some were assembling, but that we were not assembling, he stopped them saying, 'If you are not peaceful I will allow neither party to assemble.' It would have become your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> also to have given directions to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> here to forbid both the opposite party and ourselves to assemble before our meeting together to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> your righteous sentence to all.</q> To this he replied <q>It is not for me to order the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>;</q> and I answered <q>Neither shall you command us, and we will take a church, and assemble. Your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> will find that there are many more on our side than on theirs.</q> In addition to this I pointed out that we had neither reading of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, nor oblation; but only <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for the Faith and for your majesty, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> conversation.</q> So he approved, and made no further prohibition. The result is that increased crowds flock to us, and gladly listen to our teaching. I therefore beg your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that our case may have an issue pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. I am in daily danger, suspecting the wiles of both <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, as I <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> alike their influence and their negligence.</p>
