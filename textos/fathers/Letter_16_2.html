<h1>Letter 16</h1>

<p><strong>To Pope Damasus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This letter, written a few months after the preceding, is another appeal to Damasus to solve the writer's doubts. Jerome once more refers to his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and declares that his one answer to the factions at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> is, <q>He who clings to the chair of Peter is accepted by me.</q> Written from the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> in the year 377 or 378.</span> </p>

<p>1. By her importunity the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> in the gospel at last gained a hearing, <span class="stiki" id="note300294"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;15:28</a></span> and by the same means one friend induced another to give him bread at midnight, when his door was shut and his servants were in bed. <span class="stiki" id="note300295"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;11:7-8</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> overcame <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300296"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;18:10-14</a></span> although God is invincible. Nineveh was saved by its tears from the impending ruin caused by its <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300297"><a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse5">Jonah&nbsp;3:5,&nbsp;10</a></span> To what end, you ask, these far-fetched references? To this end, I make answer; that you in your greatness should look upon me in my littleness; that you, the rich shepherd, should not despise me, the ailing sheep. Christ Himself brought the robber from the cross to paradise, <span class="stiki" id="note300298"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;23:43</a></span> and, to show that repentance is never too late, He turned a murderer's death into a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Gladly does Christ embrace the prodigal son when he returns to Him; <span class="stiki" id="note300299"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;15:20</a></span> and, leaving the ninety and nine, the good shepherd carries home on His shoulders the one poor sheep that is left. <span class="stiki" id="note300300"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;15:5</a></span> From a persecutor <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> becomes a preacher. His bodily eyes are blinded to clear the eyes of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300301"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;9:8</a></span> and he who once haled Christ's servants in chains before the council of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300302"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;8:3</a></span> lives afterwards to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the bonds of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300303"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:10</a></span> </p>

<p>2. As I have already written to you,  I, who have received Christ's garb in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, am now detained in the waste that borders <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. No sentence of banishment, however, has been passed upon me; the punishment which I am undergoing is self-inflicted. But, as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> poet says:</p>

<blockquote><p>They change not mind but sky who cross the sea. </p></blockquote>

<p>The untiring foe follows me closely, and the assaults that I suffer in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> are severer than ever. For the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> frenzy raves, and the powers of the world support it. The church is rent into three factions, and each of these is eager to seize me for its own. The influence of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> is of long standing, and it is directed against me. I meantime keep crying: <q>He who clings to the chair of Peter is accepted by me.</q> Meletius, Vitalis, and Paulinus  all profess to cleave to you, and I could <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the assertion if it were made by one of them only. As it is, either two of them or else all three are guilty of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. Therefore I implore your blessedness, by our Lord's cross and passion, those necessary glories of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as you hold an apostolic office, to give an apostolic decision. Only tell me by letter with whom I am to communicate in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>, and I will <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for you that you may sit in judgment enthroned with the twelve; <span class="stiki" id="note300307"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;19:28</a></span> that when you grow old, like Peter, you may be girded not by yourself but by another, <span class="stiki" id="note300308"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;21:18</a></span> and that, like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, you may be made a citizen of the heavenly kingdom.  Do not despise a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> for which Christ died.</p>
