<h1>Letter 16</h1>

<p>Leo the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> throughout <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> greeting in the Lord.</p>

<h2>I. Introductory.</h2>

<p>By God's precepts and the Apostle's admonitions we are incited to keep a careful watch over the state of all the churches: and, if anywhere ought is found that needs rebuke, to recall men with speedy care either from the stupidity of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or from forwardness and presumption. For inasmuch as we are warned by the Lord's own command whereby the blessed Apostle Peter had the thrice repeated mystical injunction pressed upon him, that he who loves Christ should feed Christ's sheep, we are compelled by reverence for that see which, by the abundance of the Divine Grace, we hold, to shun the danger of sloth as much as possible: lest the confession of the chief Apostle whereby he testified that he loved God be not found in us: because if he (through us) carelessly feed the flock so often commended to him he is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the chief Shepherd.</p>

<h2>II. Baptism is to be administered at Easter-tide and not on the Epiphany.</h2>

<p>Accordingly when it reached my ears on reliable testimony (and I already felt a brother's affectionate anxiety about your acts, beloved) that in what is one of the chief <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> you depart from the practice of the Apostles' constitution  by administering the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to greater numbers on the feast of the Epiphany than at Easter-tide, I was surprised that you or your predecessors could have introduced so unreasonable an innovation as to confound the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the two festivals and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> there was no difference between the day on which Christ was worshipped by the wise men and that on which He rose again from the dead. You could never have fallen into this fault, if you had taken the whole of your observances from the source whence you derive your consecration to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>; and if the see of the blessed Apostle Peter, which is the mother of your <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity, were the recognized teacher of church-method. We could indeed have endured your departure from its rules with less equanimity, if you had received any previous rebuke by way of warning from us. But now as we do not despair of correcting you, we must show gentleness. And although an excuse which affects <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> is scarce tolerable in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, yet we prefer to moderate our needful rebuke and to instruct you plainly in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> method of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>III. One must distinguish one festival from another in respect of dignity and occasion.</h2>

<p>The restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> has indeed ever remained immutably fore-ordained in God's <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> counsel: but the series of events which had to be accomplished in time through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord was begun at the Incarnation of the Word. Hence there is one time when at the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel's</a> announcement the blessed Virgin Mary <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> she was to be with child through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and conceived: another, when without loss of her virgin purity the Boy was born and shown to the shepherds by the exulting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the heavenly attendants: another, when the Babe was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>: another, when the victim required by the Law is offered for him: another, when the three wise men attracted by the brightness of the new star  arrive at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> from the East and worship the Infant with the mystic offering of Gifts.</p>

<p>And again the days are not the same on which by the divinely appointed passage into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> He was withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, and on which He was recalled from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> into <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> on His pursuer's death. Among these varieties of circumstance must be included His growth of body: the Lord increases, as the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, with the progress of age and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>: at the time of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> He comes to the temple at Jerusalem with His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and when He was absent from the returning company, He is found sitting with the elders and disputing among the wondering masters and rendering an account of His remaining behind: <q>why is it,</q> He says, <q>that you sought Me? Did you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I must be in that which is My Father's ,</q> signifying that He was the Son of Him whose temple He was in. Once more when in later years He was to be declared more openly and sought out the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of His forerunner John, was there any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of His being God remaining when after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the Lord Jesus the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in form of a dove descended and rested upon Him, and the Father's voice was heard from the skies, <q>You are My beloved Son: in You I am well pleased <span class="stiki" id="note360171"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;3:17</a></span>?</q> All these things we have alluded to with as much brevity as possible for this reason, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, beloved, that though all the days of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> life were hallowed by many mighty works of His , and though in all His actions <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>  shone forth, yet at one time intimations of events were given by signs, and at one time fulfilment realized: and that all the Saviour's works that are recorded are not suitable to the time of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For if we were to commemorate with indiscriminate <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> these things also which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to have been done by the Lord after His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by the blessed John, His whole lifetime would have to be observed in a continuous succession of festivals, because all His acts were full of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>. But because the Spirit of wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> so instructed the Apostles and teachers of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as to allow nothing disordered or confused to exist in our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> observances, we must discern the relative importance of the various solemnities and observe a reasonable distinction in all the institutions of our fathers and rulers: for we cannot otherwise <q>be one flock and one shepherd <span class="stiki" id="note360174"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;10:17</a></span>,</q> except as the Apostle teaches us, <q>that we all speak the same thing: and that we be perfected in the same mind and in the same judgment <span class="stiki" id="note360175"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>IV. The reason explained why Easter and Whitsuntide are the proper seasons for baptism.</h2>

<p>Although, therefore, both these things which are connected with Christ's humiliation and those which are connected with His exaltation meet in one and the same Person, and all that is in Him of Divine power and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness conduces to the accomplishment of our restoration: yet it is appropriate that the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should change the old into the new creature on the death-day of the Crucified and the Resurrection-day of the Dead: that Christ's death and His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> may operate in the re-born , as the blessed Apostle says: <q>Are you <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that all we who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in His death? We were buried with Him through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> into death; that as Christ rose from the dead through the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have become united with the likeness of His death, we shall be also (with the likeness) of His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> ,</q> and the rest which the Teacher of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> discusses further in recommending the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: that it might be seen from the spirit of this doctrine that that is the day, and that the time chosen for regenerating the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and adopting them among the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, on which by a mystical symbolism and form , what is done in the limbs coincides with what was done in the Head Himself, for in the baptismal office death ensues through the slaying of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and threefold immersion imitates the lying in the tomb three days, and the raising out of the water is like Him that rose again from the tomb.  The very nature, therefore of the act teaches us that that is the recognized day for the general reception of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> , on which the power of the gift and the character of the action originated. And this is strongly corroborated by the consideration that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself, after He rose from the dead, handed on both the form and power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, in whose person all the chiefs of the churches received their instructions with these words, <q>Go and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360181"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> .</q> On which of course He might have instructed them even before His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>, had He not especially wished it to be understood that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of regeneration began with His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>. It must be added, indeed, that the solemn season of Pentecost, hallowed by the coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is also allowed, being as it were, the sequel and completion of the Paschal feast. And while other festivals are held on other days of the week, this festival (of Pentecost) always occurs on that day, which is marked by the Lord's resurrection: holding out, so to say, the hand of assisting <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and inviting those, who have been cut off from the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> feast by disabling sickness or length of journey or difficulties of sailing, to gain the purpose that they long for through the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. For the Only-begotten of God Himself wished no difference to be felt between Himself and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the Faith of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> and in the efficacy of His works: because there is no diversity in their nature, as He says, <q>I will ask the Father and He shall give you another Comforter that He may be with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth <span class="stiki" id="note360182"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;14:16</a></span>;</q> and again: <q>But the Comforter which is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you ;</q> and again: <q>When He, the Spirit of Truth, has come, He shall guide you into all the Truth. </q> And thus, since Christ is the Truth, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> the Spirit of Truth, and the name of <q>Comforter</q> appropriate to both, the two festivals are not dissimilar, where the sacrament is the same. </p>

<h2>5. St. Peter's example as an authority for Whitsuntide baptisms.</h2>

<p>And that we do not contend for this on our own conviction but retain it on Apostolic authority, we prove by a sufficiently apt example, following the blessed Apostle Peter, who, on the very day on which the promised coming of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> filled up the number of those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, dedicated to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the baptismal font three thousand of the people who had been converted by his preaching. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which contains the Acts of Apostles , teaches this in its faithful narrative, saying, <q>Now when they heard this they were pricked in the heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles, what shall we do, brethren? But Peter said unto them, Repent and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> every one of you in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, unto the remission of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and you shall receive the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For to you is the promise, and to your children and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call unto Him. With many other words also he testified and exhorted them saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation. They then that received his word were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and there were added in that day about three thousand <span class="stiki" id="note360187"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse37">Acts&nbsp;2:37-41</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>VI. In cases of urgency other times are allowable for baptism.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, as it is quite clear that these two seasons of which we have been speaking are the rightful ones for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the chosen in Church, we admonish you, beloved, not to add other days to this observance. Because, although there are other festivals also to which much reverence is due in God's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, yet we must rationally guard this principal and greatest sacrament as a deep <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> and not part of the ordinary routine : not, however, prohibiting the licence to succour those who are in danger by administering <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to them at any time. For while we put off the vows of those who are not pressed by ill health and live in peaceful security to those two closely connected and cognate festivals, we do not at any time refuse this which is the only safeguard of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to any one in peril of death, in the crisis of a siege, in the distress of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, in the terror of shipwreck.</p>

<h2>VII. Our Lord's baptism by John very different to the baptism of believers.</h2>

<p>But if any one thinks the feast of the Epiphany, which in proper degree is certainly to be held in due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, claims the privilege of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> because, according to some the Lord came to St. John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> on the same day, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the reason of it were quite different, and is not on an equal footing with the power by which they are re-born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, of whom it is said, <q>which were born not of blood, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the flesh, nor of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but of God <span class="stiki" id="note360189"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse13">John&nbsp;1:13</a></span> .</q> For the Lord who needed no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and sought not the remedy of being born again, desired to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> just as He desired to be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, and to have a victim offered for His purification: that He, who had been <q>made of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360190"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;4:4</a></span>,</q> as the Apostle says, might become also <q>under the law</q> which He had come, <q>not to destroy but to fulfil <span class="stiki" id="note360191"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span>,</q> and by fulfilling to end, as the blessed Apostle proclaims, saying: <q>but Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360192"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> .</q> But the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> He founded in His own person , because <q>in all things having the pre-eminence <span class="stiki" id="note360194"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse18">Colossians&nbsp;1:18</a></span>,</q> He taught that He Himself was the Beginning. And He ratified the power of re-birth on that occasion, when from His side flowed out the blood of ransom and the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.  As, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> was the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the new, and <q>the law was given by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: but <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> came through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> ;</q> as the various <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> prefigured the one Victim, and the slaughter of many lambs was ended by the offering up of Him, of whom it is said, <q>Behold the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; behold Him that takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world <span class="stiki" id="note360197"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span>;</q> so too John, not Christ, but Christ's forerunner, not the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, was so faithful in seeking, <q>not His own, but the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s <span class="stiki" id="note360198"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;2:21</a></span>,</q> as to profess himself unworthy to undo the shoes of His feet: seeing that He Himself indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <q>in water unto repentance,</q> but He who with twofold power should both restore life and destroy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, was about to <q><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and fire. </q> As then, beloved brethren, all these distinct <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> come before you, whereby to the removal of all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> you recognize that in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the elect who, according to the Apostolic rule have to be purged by exorcisms, sanctified by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and instructed by frequent sermons, two seasons only are to be observed, viz. <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> and Whitsuntide: we charge you, brother, to make no further departure from the Apostolic institutions. Because hereafter no one who thinks the Apostolic rules can be set at defiance will go unpunished.</p>

<h2>VIII. The Sicilian bishops are to send three of their number to each of the half-yearly meetings of bishops at Rome.</h2>

<p>Wherefore we require this first and foremost for the keeping of perfect harmony, that, according to the wholesome rule of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers that there should be two meetings of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> every year , three of you should appear without fail each time, on the 29th of September, to join in the council of the brethren: for thus, by the aid of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, we shall the easier guard against the rise of offenses and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> in Christ's Church: and this council must always meet and deliberate in the presence of the blessed Apostle Peter, that all his constitutions and canonical decrees may remain inviolate with all the Lord's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>.</p>

<p>These matters, upon which we thought it necessary to instruct you by the inspiration of the Lord, we wish brought to your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by our brothers and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Bacillus and Paschasinus.
