<h1>Letter 170</h1>

<p> <em>Letter of certain Easterns, who had been sent to Constantinople, to Bishop Rufus.</em></p>

<p>To our most godly and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fellow-minister Rufus, Joannes, Himerius, Theodoretus, and the rest, send greeting in the Lord. </p>

<p>True religion and the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffer, we think, in no small degree, from the absence of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Had you been on the spot you might have put a stop to the disturbances which have arisen, and the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> that has been ventured on, and might have fought on our side for the subjection of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> introduced into the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith, and that doctrine of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> which, handed down from time to time from father to son, has at length been transmitted to ourselves.</p>

<p>And we do not assert this without ground, for we have learned the mind of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> from the letter written to the very godly and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Julianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Sardica, for that letter as is right charged the above named very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to fight for the Faith laid down by the blessed fathers assembled in council at Nic&aelig;a, and not to allow any corruption to be introduced into those invincible definitions which are sufficient at once to exhibit the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and to refute <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. So your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> rightly, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, and piously advised, and the recipient of the letter followed your counsel. But many of the members of the council, to use the word of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>have gone aside,</q> and have <q>altogether become filthy,</q>  for they have abandoned the Faith which they received from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, and have subscribed the twelve Chapters of Cyril of Alexandria, which teem with <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, are in agreement with the impiety of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius, and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> all who do not accept their unconcealed unorthodoxy. To this plague smiting the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> vigorous resistance has been offered by us who have assembled from the East, and others from different <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, with the object of securing the ratification of the Faith delivered by the blessed Fathers at Nic&aelig;a. For in it, as your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, there is nothing lacking whether for the teaching of evangelic doctrines, or for the refutation of every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>For the sake of this Faith we continue to struggle, despising alike all the joys and sorrows of mortal life, if only we may preserve untouched this heritage of our fathers. For this reason we have deposed Cyril and Memnon; the former as prime mover in the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and the latter as his aider and abettor in all that has been done to ratify and uphold the Chapters published to the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. We have also <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> all that have dared to subscribe and support these impious doctrines till they shall have <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> them, and returned to the Faith of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">Fathers</a> at Nic&aelig;a.</p>

<p>But our long-suffering has done them no good. To this day they continue to do battle for those pernicious doctrines and have impaled themselves on the law of the canon which distinctly enacts <q>If any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> deposed by a synod, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> deposed by his own <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, shall perform his sacred office, without waiting for the judgment of a synod, he is to have no opportunity for defending himself, not even in another synod: but also all who communicate with him are to be expelled from the church.</q> Now this law has been broken both by the deposed and the excommunicate. For immediately after the deposition and the excommunication becoming <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them, they performed sacred functions, and they continue to do so, in plain disbelief of Him who said <q>Whatsoever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven.</q> </p>

<p>With this we have thought well to acquaint your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> at once, but in expectation of some favourable change, we have waited up to the present time. But we have been disappointed. They have continued to fight for this impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and pay no attention to the counsels of the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor. On five separate occasions he has met us, and ordered them either to reject the Chapters of Cyril as contrary to the Faith, or to be willing to do battle in their behalf, and to show in what way they are in agreement with the confession of the Fathers. We have our <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> at hand, whereby we should have shown that they are totally opposed to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and for the most part in agreement with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>For in these very Chapters the author of the noxious productions teaches that the Godhead of the only begotten Son suffered, instead of the manhood which He assumed for the sake of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, the indwelling Godhead manifestly appropriating the sufferings as of Its own body, though suffering nothing in Its own nature; and further that there is made one nature of both Godhead and manhood&mdash;for so he explains <q>The <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,</q>  as though the Godhead had undergone some change, and been turned into flesh.</p>

<p>And, further, he <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizes</a> those who make a distinction between the terms used by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> about the Lord Christ, referring those of humiliation to the manhood, and those of divine <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the Godhead, of the Lord Christ. It is with these views that <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and Eunomians, attributing the terms of humiliation to the Godhead, have not shrunk from declaring <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> to be made and created, of another substance, and unlike the Father.</p>

<p>What <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> follows on these statements it is not difficult to perceive. There is introduced a confusion of the natures, and to <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> are applied the words <q>My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why have you forsaken me;</q>  and <q>Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me,</q>  the hunger, the thirst, and the strengthening by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>; His saying <q>Now is my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> troubled,</q>  and <q>my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,</q>  and all similar passages belonging to the manhood of the Christ. Any one may perceive how these statements correspond with the impiety of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius; for they, finding themselves unable to establish the difference of substance, connect, as has been said, the sufferings, and the terms of humiliation, with the Godhead of the Christ.</p>

<p>And be your reverence well assured that now in their churches the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> teachers preach no other doctrine than that the supporters of the <q><a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homousion</a></q> at present hold the same views as <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and that, after long time, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has now at last been brought to light.</p>

<p>We on the contrary abide in the teaching, and follow in the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> footprints, of the blessed Fathers assembled at Nic&aelig;a, and of their illustrious successors, Eustathius of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, Basil of C&aelig;sarea, Gregory, John, Athanasius, Theophilus, Damasus of Rome, and Ambrose of Milan. For all these, following the words of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, have left us an exact rule of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, which all we of the East earnestly desire to preserve unmoved. The same is the wish of the Bithynians, the Paphlagonians, of Cappadocia Secunda, Pisidia, Mysia, Thessaly, and Rhodope, and very many more of the different provinces. The Italians too, it is evident, will not endure this new-fangled doctrine; for the very godly and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Martinus,  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Milan, has written a letter to us, and has sent to the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor a work by the blessed Ambrose on the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> of the Lord, of which the teaching is opposed to these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> Chapters.</p>

<p>And be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that Cyril and Memnon have not been satisfied with corrupting the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith, but have trampled all the canons underfoot. For they have received into communion men <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> in various provinces and <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>. Others lying under charges of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and of the same mind as Celestius and Pelagius, (for they are Euchit&aelig;, or Enthusiasts ) and therefore <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> by their diocesans and metropolitans, they have, in defiance of all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> discipline received into communion, so swelling their following from all possible quarters, and showing their eagerness to enforce their teaching less by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> than by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. For when they had been stripped bare of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> they devised, in their extremity, another sort of force&mdash;walls of flesh, with the idea that by their showers of <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribery</a> they might vanquish the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Fathers. But so long as your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> puts forth your strength, and you continue to fight, as you are wont, in defence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, none of these devices will be of the least avail. We exhort you therefore, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sir, to beware of the communion of the unscrupulous introducers of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all, both far and near, that these are the points for which the thrice blessed Damasus deposed the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a>, Vitalius, and Timotheus; and that the Epistle in which the writer has concealed his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and coloured it with a coating of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, must not in simplicity be received. For in the Chapters he has boldly laid bare his impiety, and dared to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> all who disagree with him, while in the letter he has vilely endeavoured to harm the simpler readers.</p>

<p>Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> must therefore beware of neglecting this matter, lest when, too late, you see this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> confirmed, you grieve in vain, and suffer affliction at being no longer able to defend the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>We have also sent you a copy of the memorial which we have given to the most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and Christ-loving emperor, containing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers at Nic&aelig;a. wherein we have rejected the newly-invented <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> of Cyril, and adjudged them to be opposed to the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>Since in accordance with the orders of the very <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor only eight of us travelled to Constantinople, we have subjoined the copy of the order given us by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod, that you may be acquainted with the provinces contained in it. Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> will learn them from the signatures of the metropolitans. We salute the brotherhood which is with you.</p>
