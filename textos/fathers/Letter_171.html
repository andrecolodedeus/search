<h1>Letter 171</h1>

<p> <em>Letter of Theodoret to John, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, after the Reconciliation.</em> </p>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who governs all things in wisdom, who provides for our unanimity, and cares for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of His people, has caused us to be assembled together, and has shown us that the views of all of us are in agreement with one another. We have assembled together, and read the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> Letter;  we have carefully examined its purport, and we have discovered that its contents are quite in accordance with our own statements, and entirely opposed to the Twelve Chapters, against which up to the present time we have continued to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, as being contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. Their teaching was that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was carnally made flesh; that there was an union of hypostasis, and that the combination in union was of nature, and that <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> was the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a> from the dead. They forbade all distinction in the terms used of our Lord, and further contained other doctrines at variance with the seeds sown by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and outcome of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> tares. The present script, however, is beautified by apostolic nobility of origin. For in it <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is exhibited as perfect God and perfect man; it shows two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and the distinction between them; an unconfounded union, made not by mixture and compounding, but in a manner ineffable and divine, and distinctly preserving the properties of the natures; the impassibility and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>; the passibility and temporary surrender to death of the temple, and its resurrection by the power of the united <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit is not of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nor derives <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and is properly stated to be of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, as being of one substance.  Beholding this <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in the letter, we have hymned Him who heals our stammering tongues, and changes our discordant noises into the harmony of sweet music. </p>
