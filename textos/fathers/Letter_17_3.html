<h1>Letter 17</h1>

<p><strong>To the Presbyter Marcus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">In this letter, addressed to one who seems to have had some pre-eminence among the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the Chalcidian desert, Jerome complains of the hard treatment meted out to him because of his refusal to take any part in the great theological dispute then raging in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a>. He protests his own <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, and begs permission to remain where he is until the return of spring, when he will retire from <q>the inhospitable desert.</q> Written in A.D. 378 or 379.</span> </p>

<p>1. I had made up my mind to use the words of the psalmist: <q>While the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> was before me I was dumb with silence; I was humbled, and I held my peace even from good</q>  and <q>I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that opens not his mouth. Thus I was as a man that hears not.</q>  But charity overcomes all things, <span class="stiki" id="note300312"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:7</a></span> and my regard for you defeats my determination. I am, indeed, less careful to retaliate upon my assailants than to comply with your request. For among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, as one has said,  not he who endures an outrage is unhappy, but he who commits it.</p>

<p>2. And first, before I speak to you of my belief (which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> full well), I am forced to cry out against the inhumanity of this country. A hackneyed quotation best expresses my meaning:</p>

<blockquote><p>What savages are these who will not grant
<br>A rest to strangers, even on their sands!
<br>They threaten <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and drive us from their coasts. </p></blockquote>

<p>I take this from a Gentile poet that one who disregards the peace of Christ may at least learn its meaning from a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. I am called a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, although I preach the consubstantial trinity. I am accused of the Sabellian impiety although I proclaim with unwearied voice that in the Godhead there are three distinct,  real, whole, and perfect <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> do right to accuse me, but the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> forfeit their <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> when they assail a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> like mine. They may, if they like, condemn me as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; but if they do they must also condemn <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the West, Damasus and Peter.  Why do they fasten the guilt on one and leave his companions uncensured? If there is but little water in the stream, it is the fault, not of the channel, but of the source. I blush to say it, but from the caves which serve us for cells we <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> condemn the world. Rolling in sack-cloth and ashes,  we pass sentence on <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. What use is the robe of a penitent if it covers the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of a king? Chains, squalor, and long hair are by right tokens of sorrow, and not ensigns of royalty. I merely ask leave to remain silent. Why do they torment a man who does not deserve their ill-will? I am a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, you say. What is it to you if I am? Stay quiet, and all is said. You are afraid, I suppose, that, with my fluent <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Syriac and Greek, I shall make a tour of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, lead the people into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and form a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>! I have <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> no man of anything; neither have I taken what I have not earned. With my own hand <span class="stiki" id="note300318"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:12</a></span> daily and in the sweat of my brow <span class="stiki" id="note300319"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;3:19</a></span> I labor for my food, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is written by the apostle: <q>If any will not work, neither shall he eat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300320"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Reverend and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father, Jesus is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> with what groans and tears I have written all this. <q>I have kept silence, says the Lord, but shall I always keep silence? Surely not.</q>  I cannot have so much as a corner of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. Every day I am asked for my confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; as though when I was regenerated in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> I had made none. I accept their formulas, but they are still dissatisfied. I sign my name to them, but they still refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me. One thing only will content them, that I should leave the country. I am on the point of departure. They have already torn away from me my dear brothers, who are a part of my very life. They are, as you see, anxious to depart&mdash; nay, they are actually departing; it is preferable, they say, to live among wild beasts rather than with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> such as these. I myself, too, would be at this moment a fugitive were I not withheld by physical infirmity and by the severity of the winter. I ask to be allowed the shelter of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> for a few months till spring returns; or if this seems too long a delay, I am ready to depart now. <q>The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.</q>  Let them climb up to heaven alone;  for them alone Christ died; they possess all things and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in all. Be it so. <q>But God forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> save in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, by whom the world is crucified unto me and I unto the world.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300324"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> </p>

<p>4. As regards the questions which you have thought fit to put to me concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I have given to the reverend Cyril  a written confession which sufficiently answers them. He who does not so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> has no part in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. My <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is attested both by your ears and by those of your blessed brother, Zenobius, to whom, as well as to yourself, we all of us here send our best greeting.</p>
