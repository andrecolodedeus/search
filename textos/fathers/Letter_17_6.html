<h1>Letter 17</h1>

<h2>Forbidding the sale of church property except for the advantage of the church</h2>

<p>Leo, the pope , to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>.</p>

<p>The occasion of specific complaints claims our attention as having <q>the care of all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>,</q> that we should make a perpetual decree precluding all <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from adopting as a practice what in two churches of your province has been unscrupulously suggested and wrongfully carried out. Upon the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the church in Tauromenium deploring the destitution they were in from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> having squandered all its estates by selling, giving away, and otherwise disposing of them, the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Panormus, who have lately had a new <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, raised a similar complaint about the misgovernment of the former <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod, at which we were presiding. Although, therefore, we have already given instructions as to what is for the advantage of both Churches, yet lest this vicious example of abominable plundering should hereafter be taken as a precedent, we wish to make this our formal command binding on you, beloved, for ever. We decree, therefore, that no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> without exception shall dare to give away, or to exchange, or to sell any of the property of his church: unless he foresees an advantage likely to accrue from so doing, and after consultation with the whole of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and with their consent he decides upon what will undoubtedly profit that church. For <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of any rank who have connived at the churches losses, must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they will be deprived of both rank and communion: because it is absolutely fair, beloved brethren, that not only the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, but also the whole of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> should advance the interests of their church and keep the gifts unimpaired of those who have contributed their own substance to the churches for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Dated 20 Oct., in the consulship of the illustrious Calepius (447).</p>
