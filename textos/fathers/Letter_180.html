<h1>Letter 180</h1>

<p> <em>Letter of Theodoretus, as some suppose, to Domnus, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, written on the Death of Cyril, Bishop of Alexandria.</em> </p>

<p>At last and with difficulty the villain has gone. The good and the gentle pass away all too soon; the bad prolong their life for years.</p>

<p>The Giver of all good, methinks, removes the former before their time from the troubles of humanity; He frees them like victors from their contests and transports them to the better life, that life which, free from death, sorrow and care, is the prize of them that contend for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. They, on the other hand, who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and practise <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> are allowed a little longer to enjoy this present life, either that sated with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> they may afterwards learn <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue's</a> lessons, or else even in this life may pay the penalty for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of their own ways by being tossed to and fro through many years of this life's sad and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> waves.</p>

<p>This wretch, however, has not been dismissed by the ruler of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> like other men, that he may possess for longer time the things which seem to be full of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> that the fellow's <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> has been daily growing and doing harm to the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the Lord has lopped him off like a plague and <q>taken away the reproach from <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  His survivors are indeed delighted at his departure. The dead, maybe, are sorry. There is some ground of alarm lest they should be so much annoyed at his company as to send him back to us, or that he should run away from his conductors like the tyrant of Cyniscus in Lucian. </p>

<p>Great care must then be taken, and it is especially your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness's</a> business to undertake this duty, to tell the guild of undertakers to lay a very big and heavy stone upon his grave, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> he should come back again, and show his changeable mind once more. Let him take his new doctrines to the shades below, and preach to them all day and all night. We are not at all afraid of his dividing them by making public addresses against <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion and by investing an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> nature with death. He will be <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> not only by ghosts learned in divine law, but also by Nimrod, <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and Sennacherib, or any other of God's enemies.</p>

<p>But I am wasting words. The poor fellow is silent whether he will or no, <q>his breath goes forth, he returns to his earth, in that very day his thoughts perish.</q>  He is doomed too to silence of another kind. His <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, detected, tie his tongue, gag his mouth, curb his passion, strike him dumb and make him bow down to the ground.</p>

<p>I really am sorry for the poor fellow. Truly the news of his death has not caused me unmixed delight, but it is tempered by sadness. On seeing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> freed from a plague of this kind I am glad and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>; but I am sorry and do mourn when I think that the wretch <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no rest from his crimes, but went on attempting greater and more grievous ones till he died. His idea was, so it is said, to throw the imperial city into confusion by attacking <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrines a second time, and to charge your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> with supporting them. But God saw and did not overlook it. <q>He put his hook into his nose and his bridle into his lips,</q>  and turned him to the earth whence he was taken. Be it then granted to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness's</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that he may obtain mercy and pity and that God's boundless clemency may surpass his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. I beg your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to drive away the agitations of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Many different reports are being bruited abroad to my alarm announcing general misfortunes. It is even said by some that your reverence is setting out against your will for the court, but so far I have despised these reports as untrue. But finding every one repeating one and the same story I have thought it right to try and learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that I may laugh at these tales if false, or sorrow not without reason if they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>.</p>
