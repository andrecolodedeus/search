<h1>Letter 181</h1>

<p> <em>Letter to Abundius, Bishop of Como</em>. </p>

<p>To my dear lord and very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother Abundius Theodoretus sends greeting in the Lord. I have discovered that your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> religiously preserves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and I have thanked <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Almighty God</a> that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which was in peril has been renewed and brought to light by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</p>

<p>Of old, after the flood, it came to pass that <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and his sons were left for seed of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Just so in our own day are reserved the fathers of the West, that by them the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches of the East may be able to preserve that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion which has been threatened with devastation and destruction by a new and impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Well may we quote those words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <q>Except the Lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and we should have been like <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Gomorrha</a>.</q>  So upon us from this impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God has fallen like a flood and invasion.</p>

<p>Now we acknowledge the presence of our Saviour in a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, and one <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, His perfect Godhead and His perfect manhood. We do not divide our one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> into two sons for He is one; but we recognise the distinction between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>; we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that one is of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the other of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a> and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, and that the divine nature is free from passion, the body which was before subject to passion being now itself too free from passion; for after the resurrection it is plainly delivered from all passion.</p>

<p>This we have learned from the letter of the very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and religious Archbishop our lord Leo. For we have read what he wrote to Flavianus, of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed memory, and have thanked the loving-kindness of the Lord because we have found an advocate and defender of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. To this letter I have given my adhesion, and have subjoined a copy of it to my present epistle, which I have also subscribed and have thereby <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that I <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the apostolic rules, that is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrines; that I abide in them to this day, and am suffering in their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>.</p>

<p>Assent has also been given by my lord Ibas and my lord Aquilinus against whom the inventors of the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> have armed the imperial power.</p>

<p>It remains for you with your very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> colleagues to bring aid to the sacred Church, and to drive away the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that threatens it. Banish the impious party which has been roused against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; give back the churches their ancient peace; so will you receive from the Lord, Who has promised to grant this boon, the fruits of your apostolic labours.</p>

<p>All the very religious and godly <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and reverend <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and brethren by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> I greet; and I and all who are with me salute your reverence. </p>
