<h1>Letter 185</h1>

<p><span class="stiki">A Letter of Augustine  to Boniface, who, as we learn from Epistle 220, was Tribune, and afterwards Count in Africa. In it Augustine shows that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> has nothing in common with that of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>; and points out the moderation with which it was possible to recall the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through awe of the imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. He adds remarks concerning the savage conduct of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and Circumcelliones, concluding with a discussion of the unpardonable nature of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. I must express my satisfaction, and congratulations, and admiration, my son Boniface,  in that, amid all the cares of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> and arms, you are eagerly anxious to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> concerning the things that are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. From hence it is clear that in you it is actually a part of your military valor to serve in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. To place, therefore, briefly before your Grace the difference between the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> say that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are different in substance; whereas the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> do not say this, but acknowledge the unity of substance in the Trinity. And if some even of them have said that the Son was inferior to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, yet they have not denied that He is of the same substance; while the greater part of them declare that they hold entirely the same belief regarding the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> as is held by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nor is this the actual question in dispute with them; but they carry on their unhappy strife solely on the question of communion, and in the perversity of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> maintain rebellious hostility against the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But sometimes, as we have heard, some of them, wishing to conciliate the Goths, since they see that they are not without a certain amount of power, profess to entertain the same belief as they. But they are refuted by the authority of their own leaders; for Donatus himself, of whose party they boast themselves to be, is never said to have held this belief.</p>

<p>2. Let not, however, things like these disturb you, my beloved son. For it is foretold to us that there must needs be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and stumbling-blocks, that we may be instructed among our enemies; and that so both our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> may be the more approved&mdash;our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, namely, that we should not be deceived by them; and our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that we should take the utmost pains we can to correct the erring ones themselves; not only watching that they should do no injury to the weak, and that they should be delivered from their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but also <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for them, that God would open their understanding, and that they might comprehend the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For in the sacred books, where the Lord Christ is made manifest, there is also His Church declared; but they, with wondrous blindness, while they would <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of Christ Himself save what is revealed in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, yet form their notion of His Church from the vanity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, instead of learning what it is on the authority of the sacred books.</p>

<p>3. They recognize Christ together with us in that which is written, "They pierced my hands and my feet. They can tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me. They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture;" and yet they refuse to recognize the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in that which follows shortly after: "All the ends of the world shall remember, and turn unto the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before You. For the kingdom is the Lord's; and He is the Governor among the nations."  They recognize Christ together with us in that which is written, "The Lord has said unto me, You are my Son, this day have I begotten You;" and they will not recognize the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in that which follows: "Ask of me, and I shall give You the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession."  They recognize Christ together with us in that which the Lord Himself says in the gospel, "Thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day;" and they will not recognize the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in that which follows: "And that repentance and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be preached in His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." <span class="stiki" id="note142471"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse46">Luke&nbsp;24:46-47</a></span> And the testimonies in the sacred books are without number, all of which it has not been necessary for me to crowd together into this book. And in all of them, as the Lord Christ is made manifest, whether in accordance with His Godhead, in which He is equal to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, so that, "In the beginning was the Word, and; the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;" or according to the humility of the flesh which He took upon Him, whereby "the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a> and dwelt among us;"  so is His Church made manifest, not in Africa alone, as they most impudently venture in the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of their vanity to assert, but spread abroad throughout the world.</p>

<p>4. For they prefer to the testimonies of Holy Writ their own contentions, because, in the case of C&aelig;cilianus, formerly a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, against whom they brought charges which they were and are unable to substantiate, they separated themselves from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash;that is, from the unity of all nations. Although, even if the charges had been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which were brought by them against C&aelig;cilianus, and could at length be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to us, yet, though we might pronounce an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> upon him even in the grave,  we are still bound not for the sake of any man to leave the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which rests for its foundation on divine <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, and is not the figment of litigious opinions, seeing that it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.  For we cannot allow that if C&aelig;cilianus had erred,&mdash; a supposition which I make without prejudice to his integrity&mdash;Christ should therefore have forfeited His inheritance. It is easy for a man to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> of his fellow-men either what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or what is false; but it marks abandoned impudence to desire to condemn the communion of the whole world on account of charges alleged against a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, of which you cannot establish the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the face of the world.</p>

<p>5. Whether C&aelig;cilianus was ordained by men who had delivered up the sacred books, I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. I did not see it, I heard it only from his enemies. It is not declared to me in the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or in the utterances of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, or in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> poetry of the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, or in the writings of any one of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, or in the eloquence of Christ Himself. But the evidence of all the several scriptures with one accord proclaims the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> spread abroad throughout the world, with which the faction of Donatus does not hold communion. The law of God declared, "In your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed." <span class="stiki" id="note142475"><a href="../bible/gen026.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;26:4</a></span> The Lord said by the mouth of His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, "From the rising of the sun, even unto the going down of the same, a pure <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> shall be offered unto my name: for my name shall be great among the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note142476"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse11">Malachi&nbsp;1:11</a></span> The Lord said through the Psalmist, "He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth."  The Lord said by His apostle, "The gospel has come unto you, as it is in all the world, and brings forth fruit." <span class="stiki" id="note142478"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse6">Colossians&nbsp;1:6</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> said with His own mouth, "You shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem, and in all <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, and in <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, and even unto the uttermost part of the earth." <span class="stiki" id="note142479"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse8">Acts&nbsp;1:8</a></span> C&aelig;cilianus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, is accused with the contentiousness of men; the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, established among all nations, is recommended by the voice of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Mere <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> forbid us to receive against C&aelig;cilianus the testimony of men whom we do not find in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has the testimony of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for those who do not follow the testimony of God have forfeited the weight which otherwise would attach to their testimony as men.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>6. I would add, moreover, that they themselves, by making it the subject of an accusation, referred the case of C&aelig;cilianus to the decision of the Emperor Constantine; and that, even after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had pronounced their judgment,  finding that they could not crush C&aelig;cilianus, they brought him in person before the above-named emperor for trial, in the most determined spirit of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. And so they were themselves the first to do what they censure in us, in order that they may deceive the unlearned, saying that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> ought not to demand any assistance from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors against the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And this, too, they did not dare to deny in the conference which we held at the same time in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>: nay, they even venture to make it a matter of boasting that their fathers had laid a criminal indictment against C&aelig;cilianus before the emperor; adding furthermore a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>, to the effect that they had there worsted him, and procured his condemnation. How then can they be otherwise than persecutors, seeing that when they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> C&aelig;cilianus by their accusations, and were overcome by him, they sought to claim false <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> for themselves by a most shameless life; not only considering it no reproach, but glorying in it as conducive to their praise, if they could prove that C&aelig;cilianus had been condemned on the accusation of their fathers? But in regard to the manner in which they were overcome at every turn in the conference itself, seeing that the records are exceedingly voluminous, and it would be a serious matter to have them read to you while you are occupied in other matters that are essential to the peace of Rome, perhaps it may be possible to have a digest  of them read to you, which I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be in the possession of my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Optatus; or if he has not a copy, he might easily procure one from the church at Sitifa; for I can well <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even that volume will prove wearisome enough to you from its lengthiness, amid the burden of your many cares.
<p>7. For the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> met with the same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> as the accusers of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Daniel. <span class="stiki" id="note142482"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm#verse24">Daniel&nbsp;6:24</a></span> For as the lions were turned against them, so the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> by which they had proposed to crush an innocent victim were turned against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>; save that, through the mercy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which seemed to be opposed to them are in reality their truest friends; for through their operation many of them have been, and are daily being reformed, and return God thanks that they are reformed, and delivered from their ruinous <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. And those who used to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> are now filled with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; and now that they have recovered their right minds, they congratulate themselves that these most wholesome <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were brought to bear against them, with as much fervency as in their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> they detested them; and are filled with the same spirit of ardent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards those who yet remain as ourselves, desiring that we should strive in like manner that those with whom they had been like to perish might be saved. For both the physician is irksome to the raging madman, and a father to his undisciplined son&mdash;the former because of the restraint, the latter because of the chastisement which he inflicts; yet both are acting in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But if they were to neglect their charge, and allow them to perish, this mistaken kindness would more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be accounted cruelty. For if the horse and mule, which have no understanding, resist with all the force of bites and kicks the efforts of the men who treat their wounds in order to cure them; and yet the men, though they are often exposed to danger from their teeth and heels, and sometimes meet with actual hurt, nevertheless do not desert them till they restore them to health through the pain and annoyance which the healing process gives&mdash;how much more should man refuse to desert his fellow-man, or brother to desert his brother, lest he should perish everlastingly, being himself now able to comprehend the vastness of the boon accorded to himself in his reformation, at the very time that he complained of suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>?</p>

<p>8. As then the apostle says, "As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, not being weary in well-doing," <span class="stiki" id="note142483"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;6:9-10</a></span> so let all be called to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, let all be recalled from the path of destruction&mdash;those who may, by the sermons of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> preachers; those who may, by the edicts of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> princes; some through those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the warnings of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, some through those who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the emperor's commands. For, moreover, when emperors enact bad <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> on the side of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, as against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, those who hold a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> are approved, and, if they persevere, are crowned; but when the emperors enact good <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> against <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, then those who rage against them are put in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and those who understand are reformed. Whosoever, therefore, refuses to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the emperors which are enacted against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, wins for himself a great reward; but whosoever refuses to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the emperors which are enacted in behalf of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, wins for himself great condemnation. For in the times, too, of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, the kings who, in dealing with the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, did not prohibit nor annul the ordinances which were issued contrary to God's commands, are all of them censured; and those who did prohibit and annul them are praised as deserving more than other men. And king <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, when he was a servant of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, enacted an impious law that a certain idol should be worshipped; but those who refused to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> his impious command acted piously and faithfully. And the very same king, when converted by a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, enacted a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and praiseworthy law on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that every one who should speak anything amiss against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, should perish utterly, with all his house. <span class="stiki" id="note142484"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse5">Daniel&nbsp;3:5,&nbsp;29</a></span> If any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> disobeyed this law, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> suffered the penalty imposed, they might have said what these men say, that they were righteous because they suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> through the law enacted by the king: and this they certainly would have said, had they been as mad as these who make divisions between the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and spurn the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and take credit for being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, because they are prevented from doing such things by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which the emperors have passed to preserve the unity of Christ and boast <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> of their innocence, and seek from men the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which they cannot receive from our Lord.</p>

<p>9. But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are such as those of whom the Lord says, "Blessed are they which are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> for righteousness' sake." <span class="stiki" id="note142485"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;5:1</a></span> It is not, therefore, those who suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for their unrighteousness, and for the divisions which they impiously introduce into <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> unity, but those who suffer for righteousness' sake, that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For Hagar also suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> at the hands of Sarah; <span class="stiki" id="note142486"><a href="../bible/gen016.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;16:6</a></span> and in that case she who <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> was righteous, and she unrighteous who suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. Are we to compare with this <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which Hagar suffered the case of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David, who was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> by unrighteous Saul?  Surely there is in essential difference, not in respect of his suffering, but because he suffered for righteousness' sake. And the Lord Himself was crucified with two thieves; <span class="stiki" id="note142488"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;23:33</a></span> but those who were joined in their suffering were separated by the difference of its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Accordingly, in the psalm, we must interpret of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who wish to be distinguished from false <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the verse in which it is said, "Judge me, O Lord, and distinguish  my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from an ungodly nation."  He does not say, Distinguish my punishment, but "Distinguish my <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>." For the punishment of the impious may be the same; but the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> is always different. To whose mouth also the words are suitable, "They <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> me wrongfully; help me;"  in which the Psalmist claimed to have a right to be helped in righteousness, because his adversaries <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him wrongfully; for if they had been right in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> him, he would have deserved not help, but correction.</p>

<p>10. But if they think that no one can be justified in using <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>&mdash;as they said in the course of the conference that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church must necessarily be the one which suffers <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, not the one inflicting it&mdash;in that case I no longer urge what I observed above; because, if the matter stand as they maintain that it does, then C&aelig;cilianus must have belonged to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, seeing that their fathers <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> him, by pressing his accusation even to the tribunal of the emperor himself. For we maintain that he belonged to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church, not merely because he suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but because he suffered it for righteousness' sake; but that they were alienated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not merely because they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, but because they did so in unrighteousness. This, then, is our position. But if they make no inquiry into the causes for which each person inflicts <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or for which he suffers it, but think that it is a sufficient sign of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> that he does not inflict <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, but suffers it, then beyond all question they include C&aelig;cilianus in that definition, who did not inflict, but suffered <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; and they equally exclude their own fathers from the definition, for they inflicted, but did not suffer it.</p>

<p>11. But this, I say, I forbear to urge. Yet one point I must press: If the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church is the one which actually suffers <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, not the one which inflicts it, let them ask the apostle of what Church Sarah was a type, when she inflicted <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> on her hand-maid. For he declares that the free mother of us all, the heavenly Jerusalem, that is to say, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, was prefigured in that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who cruelly entreated her hand-maid. <span class="stiki" id="note142492"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;4:22-31</a></span> But if we investigate the story further, we shall find that the handmaid rather <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> Sarah by her haughtiness, than Sarah the handmaid by her severity: for the handmaid was doing wrong to her mistress; the mistress only imposed on her a proper discipline in her haughtiness. Again I ask, if good and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men never inflict <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> upon any one, but only suffer it, whose words they think that those are in the psalm where we read, "I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them; neither did I turn again till they were consumed?"  If, therefore, we wish either to declare or to recognize the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, there is a <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of unrighteousness, which the impious inflict upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; and there is a righteous <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> inflicts upon the impious. She therefore is <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for righteousness' sake; but they are miserable, suffering <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> for unrighteousness. Moreover, she persecutes in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, they in the spirit of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; she that she may correct, they that they may overthrow: she that she may recall from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, they that they may drive headlong into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. Finally, she persecutes her enemies and arrests them, until they become weary in their vain opinions, so that they should make advance in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but they, returning <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for good, because we take measures for their good, to secure their <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, endeavor even to strip us of our temporal safety, being so in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, that they commit it on their own <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, when they cannot find victims in any others. For in proportion as the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> endeavors to deliver them from that destruction, so that none of them should die, so their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> endeavors either to slay us, that they may feed the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of their own cruelty, or even to kill themselves, that they may not seem to have lost the power of putting men to death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>12. But those who are unacquainted with their habits think that they only kill themselves now that all the mass of the people are freed from the fearful <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of their usurped dominion, in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which have been passed for the preservation of unity. But those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what they were accustomed to do before the passing of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, do not wonder at their deaths, but call to mind their character; and especially how vast crowds of them used to come in procession to the most frequented ceremonies of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, while the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> still continued&mdash;not with the view of breaking the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, but that they might be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by those who worshipped them. For if they had sought to break the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> under the sanction of legitimate authority, they might, in case of anything happening to them, have had some shadow of a claim to be considered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>; but their only object in coming was, that while the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> remained uninjured, they themselves might meet with death. For it was the general custom of the strongest youths among the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, for each of them to offer in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> themselves any victims that he might have slain. Some went so far as to offer themselves for slaughter to any travellers whom they met with arms, using violent threats that they would <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> them if they failed to meet with death at their hands. Sometimes, too, they extorted with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> from any passing judge that they should be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> by the executioners, or by the officer of his court. And hence we have a story, that a certain judge played a trick upon them, by ordering them to be bound and led away, as though for execution, and so escaped their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, without injury to himself or them. Again, it was their daily sport to kill themselves, by throwing themselves over precipices, or into the water, or into the fire. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> taught them these three modes of suicide, so that, when they wished to die, and could not find any one whom they could terrify into slaying them with his sword, they threw themselves over the rocks, or committed themselves to the fire or the eddying pool. But who can be thought to have taught them this, having gained possession of their hearts, but he who actually suggested to our Saviour Himself as a duty sanctioned by the law, that He should throw Himself down from a pinnacle of the temple? <span class="stiki" id="note142494"><a href="../bible/luk004.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;4:9</a></span> And his suggestion they p. 638 would surely have thrust far from them, had they carried Christ, as their Master, in their hearts. But since they have rather given place within them to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, they either perish like the herd of swine, whom the legion of devils drove down from the hill-side into the sea, <span class="stiki" id="note142495"><a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse13">Mark&nbsp;5:13</a></span> or, being rescued from that destruction, and gathered together in the loving bosom of our <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Mother, they are delivered just as the boy was delivered by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, whom his father brought to be healed of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, saying that ofttimes he was wont to fall into the fire, and oft into the water. <span class="stiki" id="note142496"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;17:14</a></span>

<p>13. Whence it appears that great mercy is shown towards them, when by the force of those very imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> they are in the first instance rescued against their will from that <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> in which, through the teaching of lying devils, they learned those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doctrines, so that afterwards they might be made whole in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, becoming accustomed to the good teaching and example which they find in it. For many of the men whom we now admire in the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> fervor of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and for their charity, give thanks to God with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> that they are no longer in that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which led them to mistake those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things for good&mdash;which thanks they would not now be offering willingly, had they not first, even against their will, been severed from that impious association. And what are we to say of those who confess to us, as some do every day, that even in the olden days they had long been wishing to be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; but they were living among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> among whom those who wished to be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> could not be so through the infirmity of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, seeing that if any one there said a single word in favor of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he and his house were utterly destroyed at once? Who is mad enough to deny that it was right that assistance should have been given through the imperial decrees, that they might be delivered from so great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, while those whom they used to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> are compelled in turn to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and are either themselves corrected through the same terror, or, at any rate, while they pretend to be corrected, they abstain from further <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of those who really are, to whom they formerly were objects of continual dread?</p>

<p>14. But if they have chosen to destroy themselves, in order to prevent the deliverance of those who had a right to be delivered, and have sought in this way to alarm the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> hearts of the deliverers, so that in their apprehension that some few abandoned men might perish, they should allow others to lose the opportunity of deliverance from destruction, who were either already unwilling to perish, or might have been saved from it by the employment of compulsion; what is in this case the function of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity, especially when we consider that those who utter threats of their own violent and <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> deaths are very few in number in comparison with the nations that are to be delivered? What then is the function of brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Does it, because it fears the shortlived fires of the furnace for a few, therefore abandon all to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> fires of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>? And does it leave so many, who are either already desirous, or hereafter are not strong enough to pass to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, to perish everlastingly, while taking precautions that some few should not perish by their own hand, who are only living to be a hindrance in the way of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others, whom they will not permit to live in accordance with the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in the hopes that some day or other they may teach them too to hasten their death by their own hand, in the manner which now causes them themselves to be a terror to their neighbors, in accordance with the custom inculcated by their devilish tenets? Or does it rather save all whom it can, even though those whom it cannot save should perish in their own infatuation? For it ardently desires that all should live, but it more especially labors that not all should die. But thanks be to the Lord, that both among us&mdash; not indeed everywhere, but in the great majority of places&mdash; and also in the other parts of Africa, the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> both has gained and is gaining ground, without any of these madmen being killed. But those deplorable <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are done in places where there is an utterly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> and useless set of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who were given to such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> even in the days of old.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>15. And indeed, before those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were put in force by the emperors of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the doctrine of the peace and unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was beginning by degrees to gain ground, and men were coming over to it even from the faction of Donatus, in proportion as each learned more, and became more willing, and more master of his own actions; although, at the same time, among the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> herds of abandoned men were disturbing the peace of the innocent for one reason or another in the spirit of the most reckless <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. What master was there who was not compelled to live in dread of his own servant, if he had put himself under the guardianship of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>? Who dared even threaten one who sought his ruin with punp. 639 ishment? Who dared to exact payment of a debt from one who consumed his stores, or from any debtor whatsoever, that sought their assistance or protection? Under the threat of beating, and burning, and immediate death, all documents compromising the worst of slaves were destroyed, that they might depart in freedom. Notes of hand that had been extracted from debtors were returned to them. Any one who had shown a contempt for their hard words were compelled by harder blows to do what they desired. The houses of innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had offended them were either razed to the ground or burned. Certain heads of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> parentage, and brought up with a good education were carried away half dead after their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, or bound to the mill, and compelled by blows to turn it round, after the fashion of the meanest beasts of burden. For what assistance from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> rendered by the civil powers was ever of any avail against them? What official ever ventured so much as to breathe in their presence? What agents ever exacted payment of a debt which they had been unwilling to discharge? Who ever endeavored to avenge those who were <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in their massacres? Except, indeed, that their own <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> took revenge on them, when some, by provoking against themselves the swords of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whom they <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to kill them under <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of instant death, others by throwing themselves over sundry precipices, others by waters, others by fire, gave themselves over on the several occasions to a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> death, and gave up their lives as offerings to the dead by punishments inflicted with their own hands upon themselves.

<p>16. These <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> were looked upon with horror by many who were firmly rooted in the same superstitious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and accordingly, when they supposed that it was sufficient to establish their innocence that they were ill contented with such conduct, it was urged against them by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>: If these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> do not pollute your innocence, how then do you maintain that the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world has been polluted by the alleged <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of C&aelig;cilianus, which are either altogether <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, or at least not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> against him? How come you, by a deed of gross impiety, to separate yourselves from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as from the threshing-floor of the Lord, which must needs contain, up to the time of the final winnowing, both grain which is to be stored in the garner, and chaff that is to be burned up with fire? <span class="stiki" id="note142497"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;3:12</a></span> And thus some were so convinced by argument as to come over to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, being prepared even to meet the hostility of abandoned men; while the greater number, though equally convinced, and though desirous to do the same, yet dared not make enemies of these men, who were so unbridled in their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, seeing that some who had come over to us experienced the greatest cruelty at their hands.</p>

<p>17. To this we may add, that in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> itself some of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the same party, making a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> among themselves, and dividing the party of Donatus among the lower orders of the Carthaginian people, ordained as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> against <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> a certain <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> named Maximianus, who could not brook the control of his own diocesan. And as this displeased the greater part of them, they condemned the aforesaid Maximinus, with twelve others who had been present at his ordination, but gave the rest that were associated in the same <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> a chance of returning to their communion on an appointed day. But afterwards some of these twelve, and certain others of those who had had the time of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> allowed to them, but had only returned after the day appointed, were received by them without degradation from their orders; and they did not venture to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> a second time those whom the condemned ministers had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the pale of their communion. This action of theirs at once made strongly against them in favor of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> party, so that their mouths were wholly closed. And on the matter being diligently spread abroad, as was only right, in order to cure men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and when it was shown in every possible direction by the sermons and discussions of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> divines, that to maintain the peace of Donatus they had not only received back those whom they had condemned, with full recognition of their orders, but had even been afraid to declare that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be void which had been administered outside their Church by men whom they had condemned or even suspended; while, in violation of the peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they cast in the teeth of all the world the stain conveyed by contact with some sinners, it matters little with whom, and declared <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be consequently void which had been administered even in the very Churches whence the gospel itself had come to Africa;&mdash; seeing all this, very many began to be confounded, and blushing before what they saw to be mostly manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they submitted to correction in greater numbers than was their wont; and men began to breathe with a somewhat freer sense of liberty from their cruelty, and that to a considerably greater extent in every direction.</p>

<p>18. Then indeed they blazed forth with such fury, and were so excited by the goadings of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, that scarcely any churches of our communion could be safe against their treachery and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and most undisguised robberies; scarcely any road secure by which men could travel to preach the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in opposition to their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, and convict the rashness of their folly by the clear enunciation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. They went so far, besides, in proposing hard terms of reconciliation, not only to the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> or to any of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, but even in a measure to certain of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For the only alternative offered was to hold their tongues about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or to endure their savage fury. But if they did not speak about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, not only was it impossible for any one to be delivered by their silence, but many were even sure to be destroyed by their submitting to be led astray; while if, by their preaching the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the rage of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> was again provoked to vent its <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, though some would be delivered, and those who were already on our side would be strengthened, yet the weak would again be deterred by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> from following the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. When the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, therefore, was reduced to these straits in its affliction, any one who thinks that anything was to be endured, rather than that the assistance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be rendered through the agency of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors, should be sought, does not sufficiently observe that no good account could possibly be rendered for neglect of this precaution.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>19. But as to the argument of those men who are unwilling that their impious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> should be checked by the enactment of righteous <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, when they say that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> never sought such measures from the kings of the earth, they do not consider the different character of that age, and that everything comes in its own season. For what emperor had as yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, so as to serve Him in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> by enacting <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against impiety, when as yet the declaration of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was only in the course of its fulfillment, "Why do the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> rage, and the people <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> a vain thing? The kings of the earth set themselves, and their rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against His Anointed;" and there was as yet no sign of that which is spoken a little later in the same psalm: "Be wise now, therefore, O you kings; be instructed, you judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with trembling."  How then are kings to serve the Lord with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, except by preventing and chastising with religious severity all those acts which are done in opposition to the commandments of the Lord? For a man serves God in one way in that he is man, in another way in that he is also king. In that he is man, he serves Him by living faithfully; but in that he is also king, he serves Him by enforcing with suitable rigor such <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as ordain what is righteous, and punish what is the reverse. Even as Hezekiah served Him, by destroying the groves and the temples of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and the high places which had been built in violation of the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note142499"><a href="../bible/2ki018.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;18:4</a></span> or even as Josiah served Him, by doing the same things in his turn; <span class="stiki" id="note142500"><a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;23:4-5</a></span> or as the king of the Ninevites served Him, by compelling all the men of his city to make satisfaction to the Lord; <span class="stiki" id="note142501"><a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse6">Jonah&nbsp;3:6-9</a></span> or as Darius served Him, by giving the idol into the power of Daniel to be broken, and by casting his enemies into the den of lions;  or as <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> served Him, of whom I have spoken before, by issuing a terrible law to prevent any of his subjects from <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> God. <span class="stiki" id="note142503"><a href="../bible/dan003.htm#verse29">Daniel&nbsp;3:29</a></span> In this way, therefore, kings can serve the Lord, even in so far as they are kings, when they do in His service what they could not do were they not kings.

<p>20. Seeing, then, that the kings of the earth were not yet serving the Lord in the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but were still imagining vain things against the Lord and against His Anointed, that all might be fulfilled which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, it must be granted that at that time acts of impiety could not possibly be prevented by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, but were rather performed under their sanction. For the order of events was then so rolling on, that even the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> were killing those who preached Christ, thinking that they did God service in so doing, just as Christ had foretold, <span class="stiki" id="note142504"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;16:2</a></span> and the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> were raging against the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and the patience of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> was overcoming them all. But so soon as the fulfillment began of what is written in a later psalm, "All kings shall fall down before Him; all nations shall serve Him,"  what sober-minded man could say to the kings, "Let not any thought trouble you within your kingdom as to who restrains or attacks the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of your Lord; deem it not a matter in which you should be concerned, which of your subjects may choose to be religious or <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>," seeing that you cannot say to them, "Deem it no concern of yours which of your subjects may choose to be chaste, or which unchaste?" For why, when <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, should adulteries be punished by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and sacrilege allowed? Is it a lighter matter that a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> should not keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, than that a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should be faithless to her husband? Or if those faults which are committed not in contempt but in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of religious <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are to be visited with lighter punishment, are they therefore to be neglected altogether?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>21. It is indeed better (as no one ever could deny) that men should be led to worship God by teaching, than that they should be driven to it by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment or pain; but it does not follow that because the former course produces the better men, therefore those who do not yield to it should be neglected. For many have found advantage (as we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, and are daily proving by actual experiment), in being first compelled by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or pain, so that they might afterwards be influenced by teaching, or might follow out in act what they had already learned in word. Some, indeed, set before us the sentiments of a certain secular author, who said,</p>

<blockquote><p>"'Tis well, I think, by shame the young to train,
<br>And dread of meanness, rather than by pain." 
<br>This is unquestionably <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But while those are better who are guided aright by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, those are certainly more numerous who are corrected by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For, to answer these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> out of their own author, we find him saying in another place,
<br>"Unless by pain and suffering you are taught,
<br>You can not guide yourself aright in anything." 
</p></blockquote>

<p>But, moreover, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture has both said concerning the former better class, "There is no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; but perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note142508"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> and also concerning the latter lower class, which furnishes the majority, "A servant will not be corrected by words; for though he understand, he will not answer." <span class="stiki" id="note142509"><a href="../bible/pro029.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;29:19</a></span> In saying, "He will not be corrected by words," he did not order him to be left to himself, but implied an admonition as to the means whereby he ought to be corrected; otherwise he would not have said, "He will not be corrected by words," but without any qualification, "He will not be corrected." For in another place he says that not only the servant, but also the undisdained son, must be corrected with stripes, and that with great fruits as the result; for he says, "You shall beat him with the rod, and shall deliver his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> from <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note142510"><a href="../bible/pro023.htm#verse14">Proverbs&nbsp;23:14</a></span> and elsewhere he says, "He that spares the rod <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his son." <span class="stiki" id="note142511"><a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse24">Proverbs&nbsp;13:24</a></span> For, give us a man who with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> understanding can say with all the energy of his heart, "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> thirsts for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?"  and for such an one there is no need of the terror of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, to say nothing of temporal punishments or imperial <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, seeing that with him it is so indispensable a blessing to cleave unto the Lord, that he not only dreads being parted from that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> as a heavy punishment, but can scarcely even bear delay in its attainment. But yet, before the good sons can say they have "a desire to depart, and to be with Christ," <span class="stiki" id="note142513"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> many must first be recalled to their Lord by the stripes of temporal scourging, like <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> slaves, and in some degree like good-for-nothing fugitives.</p>

<p>22. For who can possibly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> us more than Christ, who laid down His life for His sheep? <span class="stiki" id="note142514"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;10:15</a></span> And yet, after calling Peter and the other <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by His words alone, when He came to summon <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who was before called Saul, subsequently the powerful builder of His Church, but originally its cruel persecutor, He not only constrained him with His voice, but even dashed him to the earth with His power; and that He might forcibly bring one who was raging amid the darkness of infidelity to desire the light of the heart, He first struck him with physical blindness of the eyes. If that punishment had not been inflicted, he would not afterwards have been healed by it; and since he had been wont to see nothing with his eyes open, if they had remained unharmed, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> would not tell us that at the imposition of Ananias' hands, in order that their sight might be restored, there fell from them as it had been scales, by which the sight had been obscured. <span class="stiki" id="note142515"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;9:1-18</a></span> Where is what the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> were wont to cry: Man is at liberty to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Towards whom did Christ use <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>? Whom did He compel? Here they have the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>. Let them recognize in his case Christ first compelling, and afterwards teaching; first striking, and afterwards consoling. For it is wonderful how he who entered the service of the gospel in the first instance under the compulsion of bodily punishment, afterwards labored more in the gospel than all they who were called by word only; <span class="stiki" id="note142516"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:10</a></span> and he who was compelled by the greater influence  of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, displayed that perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>23. Why, therefore, should not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> use force in compelling her lost sons to return, if the lost sons compelled others to their destruction? Although even men who have not been compelled, but only led astray, are received by their loving mother with more affection if they are recalled to her bosom through the enforcement of terrible but salutary <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and are the objects of far more deep congratulation than those whom she had never lost. Is it not a part of the care of the shepherd, when any sheep have left the flock, even though not violently forced away, but led astray by tender words and coaxing blandishments, to bring them back to the fold of his master when he has found them, by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> or even the pain of the whip, if they show symptoms of resistance; especially since, if they multiply with growing abundance among the fugitive slaves and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, he has the more right in that the mark of the master is recognized on them, which is not outraged in those whom we receive but do not rebaptize? For the wandering of the sheep is to be corrected in such wise that the mark of the Redeemer should not be destroyed on it. For even if any one is marked with the royal stamp by a deserter who is marked with it himself, and the two receive forgiveness,  and the one returns to his service, and the other begins to be in the service in which he had no part before, that mark is not effaced in either of the two, but rather it is recognized in both of them, and approved with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which is due to it because it is the king's. Since then they cannot show that the destination is bad to which they are compelled, they maintain that they ought to be compelled by force even to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>. But we have shown that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was compelled by Christ; therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in trying to compel the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, is following the example of her Lord, though in the first instance she waited in the hopes of needing to compel no one, that the prediction of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> might be fulfilled concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of kings and peoples.</p>

<p>24. For in this sense also we may interpret without absurdity the declaration of the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, when he says, "Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is fulfilled." <span class="stiki" id="note142518"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:6</a></span> Whence also the Lord Himself bids the guests in the first instance to be invited to His great supper, and afterwards compelled; for on His servants making answer to Him, "Lord, it is done as You have commanded, and yet there is room," He said to them, "Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in." <span class="stiki" id="note142519"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;14:22-23</a></span> In those, therefore, who were first brought in with gentleness, the former <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is fulfilled; but in those who were compelled, the disobedience is avenged. For what else is the meaning of "Compel them to come in," after it had previously said, "Bring in," and the answer had been made, "Lord, it is done as You commanded, and yet there is room"? If He had wished it to be understood that they were to be compelled by the terrifying force of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, many divine <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> were rather wrought in the sight of those who were first called, especially in the sight of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, of whom it was said, "The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> require a sign;" <span class="stiki" id="note142520"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:22</a></span> and, moreover, among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> themselves the gospel was so commended by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> in the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that had these been the means by which they were ordered to be compelled, we might rather have had good grounds for supposing, as I said before, that it was the earlier guests who were compelled. Wherefore, if the power which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has received by divine appointment in its due season, through the religious character and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of kings, be the instrument by which those who are found in the highways and hedges&mdash; that is, in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms&mdash; are compelled to come in, then let them not find fault with being compelled, but consider whether they be so compelled. The supper of the Lord is the unity of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, not only in the sacrament of the altar, but also in the bond of peace. Of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> themselves, indeed, we can say that they compel no man to any good thing; for whomsoever they compel, they compel to nothing else but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>25. However, before those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were sent into Africa by which men are compelled to come in to the sacred Supper, it seemed to certain of the brethren, of whom I was one, that although the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> was raging in every direction, yet we should not ask of the emperors to ordain that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should absolutely cease to be, by sanctioning a punishment to be inflicted on all who wished to live in it; but that they should rather content themselves with ordaining that those who either preached the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with their voice, or established it by their study, should no longer be exposed to the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. And p. 643 this they thought might in some measure be effected, if they would take the law which Theodosius, of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> memory, enacted generally against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> of all kinds, to the effect that any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a>, being found in any place, should be fined ten pounds of gold, and confirm it in more express terms against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, who denied that they were <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; but with such reservations, that the fine should not be inflicted upon all of them, but only in those districts where the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffered any <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> from their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or from the Circumcelliones, or at the hands of any of their people; so that after a formal complaint had been made by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who had suffered the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or other ministers should immediately be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a>, under the commission given to the officers, to pay the fine. For we thought that in this way, if they were terrified and no longer dared do anything of the sort, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might be freely taught and held under such conditions, that while no one was compelled to it, any one might follow it who was anxious to do so without intimidation, so that we might not have false and pretended <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. And although a different view was held by other brethren, who either were more advanced in years, or had experience of many states and places where we saw the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> firmly established, which had, however, been planted and confirmed by God's great goodness at a time when men were compelled to come in to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of previous emperors, yet we carried our point, to the effect that the measure which I have described above should be sought in preference from the emperors: it was decreed in our council, <span class="stiki" id="note142521"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;16:2</a></span> and envoys were sent to the court of the Count.

<p>26. But God in His great mercy, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how necessary was the terror inspired by these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and a kind of medicinal inconvenience for the cold and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> hearts of many men, and for that hardness of heart which cannot be softened by words, but yet admits of softening through the agency of some little severity of discipline, brought it about that our envoys could not obtain what they had undertaken to ask. For our arrival had already been anticipated by the serious complaints of certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from other districts, who had suffered much ill-treatment at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> themselves, and had been thrust out from their sees; and, in particular, the attempt to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> Maximianus, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Bagai, under circumstances of incredible atrocity, had caused measures to be taken which left our deputation nothing to do. For a law had already been published, that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, being of so savage a description that mercy towards it really involved greater cruelty than its very <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> wrought, should for the future be prevented not only from being violent, but from existing with impunity at all; but yet no capital punishment was imposed upon it, that even in dealing with those who were unworthy, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> gentleness might be observed, but a pecuniary fine was ordained, and sentence of exile was pronounced against their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or ministers.</p>

<p>27. With regard to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Bagai, in consequence of his claim being allowed in the ordinary courts, after each party had been heard in turn, in a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>  of which the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> had taken possession, as being the property of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, they rushed upon him as he was standing at the altar, with fearful <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and cruel fury, beat him savagely with cudgels and weapons of every kind, and at last with the very boards of the broken altar. They also wounded him with a dagger in the groin so severely, that the effusion of blood would have soon put an end to his life, had not their further cruelty <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of service for its preservation; for, as they were dragging him along the ground thus severely wounded, the dust forced into the spouting vein stanched the blood, whose effusion was rapidly on the way to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> his death. Then, when they had at length abandoned him, some of our party tried to carry him off with psalms; but his enemies, inflamed with even greater rage, tore him from the hands of those who were carrying him, inflicting grievous punishment on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, whom they put to flight, being far superior to them in numbers, and easily inspiring terror by their <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. Finally, they threw him into a certain elevated tower, thinking that he was by this time dead, though in fact he still breathed. Lighting then on a soft heap of earth, and being espied by the light of a lamp by some men who were passing by at night, he was recognized and picked up, and being carried to a religious house, by dint of great care, was restored in a few days from his state of almost hopeless danger. Rumor, however, had carried the tidings even across the sea that he had been killed by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>; and when afterwards he himself went abroad, and was most unexpectedly seen to be alive, he showed, by the number, the severity, and the freshness of his wounds, how fully rumor had been justified in bringing tidings of his death.</p>

<p>28. He sought assistance, therefore, from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperor, not so much with any desire of revenging himself, as with the view of defending the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> entrusted to his charge. And if he had omitted to do this, he would have deserved not to be praised for his forbearance, but to be blamed for negligence. For neither was the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> taking precautions on behalf of his own transitory life, but for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> when he caused the plot of those who had conspired to slay him to be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the Roman captain, the effect of which was that he was conducted by an escort of armed soldiers to the place where they proposed to send him, that he might escape the ambush of his foes. <span class="stiki" id="note142523"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse17">Acts&nbsp;23:17-32</a></span> Nor did he for a moment hesitate to invoke the protection of the Roman <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, proclaiming that he was a Roman citizen, who at that time could not be scourged; <span class="stiki" id="note142524"><a href="../bible/act022.htm#verse25">Acts&nbsp;22:25</a></span> and again, that he might not be delivered to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who sought to kill him, he appealed to C&aelig;sar, <span class="stiki" id="note142525"><a href="../bible/act025.htm#verse11">Acts&nbsp;25:11</a></span> &mdash; a Roman emperor, indeed, but not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. And by this he showed sufficiently plainly what was afterwards to be the duty of the ministers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when in the midst of the dangers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they found the emperors <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. And hence therefore, it came about that a religious and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor, when such matters were brought to his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, thought it well, by the enactment of most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, entirely to correct the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of this great impiety, and to bring those who bore the standards of Christ against the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Christ into the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even by terror and compulsion, rather than merely to take away their power of doing <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and to leave them the freedom of going astray, and perishing in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>29. Presently, when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> themselves arrived in Africa, in the first place those who were already seeking an opportunity for doing so, or were afraid of the raging <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, or were previously deterred by a feeling of unwillingness to offend their friends, at once came over to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Many, too, who were only restrained by the force of custom handed down in their homes from their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but had never before considered what was the groundwork of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> itself&mdash;had never, indeed, wished to investigate and contemplate its nature,&mdash; beginning now to use their observation, and finding nothing in it that could compensate for such serious loss as they were called upon to suffer, became <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> without any difficulty; for, having been made careless by security, they were now instructed by anxiety. But when all these had set the example, it was followed by many who were less qualified of themselves to understand what was the difference between the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>30. Accordingly, when the great masses of the people had been received by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mother with rejoicing into her bosom, there remained outside cruel crowds, persevering with unhappy animosity in that <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. Even of these the greater number communicated in feigned reconciliation, and others escaped notice from the scantiness of their numbers. But those who feigned conformity, becoming by degrees accustomed to our communion, and hearing the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, especially after the conference and disputation which took place between us and their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, were to a great extent brought to a right belief. Yet in certain places, where a more obstinate and implacable body prevailed, whom the smaller number that entertained better views about communion with us could not resist, or where the masses were under the influence of a few more powerful leaders, whom they followed in a wrong direction, our difficulties continued somewhat longer. Of these places there are a few in which trouble still exists, in the course of which the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and especially the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, have suffered many terrible hardships, which it would take too long to go through in detail, seeing that some of them had their eyes put out, and one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> his hands and tongue cut off, while some were actually murdered. I say nothing of massacres of the most cruel description, and robberies of houses, committed in nocturnal burglaries, with the burning not only of private houses, but even of churches,&mdash; some being found abandoned enough to cast the sacred books into the flames.</p>

<p>31. But we were consoled for the suffering inflicted on us by these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, by the fruit which resulted from them. For wherever such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> were committed by unbelievers, there <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> unity has advanced with greater fervency and perfection, and the Lord is praised with greater earnestness for having deigned to grant that His servants might win their brethren by their sufferings, and might gather together into the peace of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through His blood His sheep who were dispersed abroad in deadly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. The Lord is powerful and full of compassion, to whom we daily <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that He will give repentance to the rest as well, that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, by whom they are taken captive at his will, <span class="stiki" id="note142526"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse26">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:26</a></span> though now they only seek materials for <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniating</a> us, and returning to us <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for good; because they have not the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to make them understand what feelings and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we continue to have towards them, and how we are anxious, in accordance with the injunction of the Lord, given to His pastors by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel, to bring again that which was driven away, and to seek that which was lost. <span class="stiki" id="note142527"><a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse4">Ezekiel&nbsp;34:4</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>32. But they, as we have sometimes said before in other places, do not charge themselves with what they do to us; while, on the other hand, they charge us with what they do to themselves. For which of our party is there who would desire, I do not say that one of them should perish, but should even lose any of his possessions? But if the house of David could not earn peace on any other terms except that Absalom his son should have been slain in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which he was waging against his father, although he had most carefully given strict injunctions to his followers that they should use their utmost endeavors to preserve him alive and safe, that his paternal affection might be able to pardon him on his repentance, what remained for him except to weep for the son that he had lost, and to console himself in his sorrow by reflecting on the acquisition of peace for his kingdom?  The same, then, is the case with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, our mother; for when <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is waged against her by men who are certainly different from sons, since it must be acknowledged that from the great tree, which by the spreading of its branches is extended over all the world, this little branch in Africa is broken off, while she is willing in her <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to give them birth, that they may return to the root, without which they cannot have the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, at the same time if she collects the remainder in so large a number by the loss of some, she soothes and cures the sorrow of her maternal heart by the thoughts of the deliverance of such mighty nations; especially when she considers that those who are lost perish by a death which they brought upon themselves, and not, like Absalom, by the fortune of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. And if you were to see the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of those who are delivered in the peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, their crowded assemblies, their eager <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, the gladsomeness with which they flock together, both to hear and sing <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, and to be instructed in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the great grief with which many of them recall to mind their former <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> with which they come to the consideration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which they have learned, with the indignation and detestation which they feel towards their lying teachers, now that they have found out what falsehoods they disseminated concerning our <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; and how many of them, moreover, acknowledge that they long ago desired to be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but dared not take the step in the midst of men of such <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>&mdash;if, I say, you were to see the congregations of these nations delivered from such perdition, then you would say that it would have been the extreme of cruelty, if in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that certain desperate men, in number not to be compared with the multitudes of those who were rescued, might be burned in fires which they voluntarily kindled for themselves, these others had been left to be lost for ever, and to be tortured in fires which shall not be quenched.

<p>33. For if two men were dwelling together in one house, which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> with absolute certainty to be upon the point of falling down, and they were unwillingly to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us when we warned them of the danger, and persisted in remaining in the house; if it were in our power to rescue them, even against their will, and we were afterwards to show them the ruin threatening their house, so that they should not dare to return again within its reach, I think that if we abstained from doing it, we should well deserve the charge of cruelty. And further, if one of them should say to us, Since you have entered the house to save our lives, I shall immediately kill myself; while the other was not indeed willing to come forth from the house, nor to be rescued, but yet had not the hardihood to kill himself: which alternative should we choose&mdash;to leave both of them to be overwhelmed in the ruin, or that, while one at any rate was delivered by our merciful efforts, the other should perish by no fault of ours, but rather by his own? No one is so unhappy as not to find it easy enough to deride what should be done in such a case. And I have proposed the question of two individuals,&mdash; one, that is to say, who is lost, and one who is delivered; what then must we think of the case where some few are lost, and an innumerable multitude of nations are delivered? For there are actually not so many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who thus perish of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, as there are estates, villages, streets, fortresses, municipal towns, cities, that are delivered by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> under consideration from that fatal and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> destruction.</p>

<p>34. But if we were to consider the matter under discussion with yet greater care, I think that if there were a large number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the house which was going to fall, and any single one of them could be saved, and when we endeavored to effect his rescue, the others were to kill themselves by jumping out of the windows, we should console ourselves in our grief for the loss of the rest by the thoughts of the safety of the one; and we should not allow all to perish without a single rescue, in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the remainder should destroy themselves. What then should we think of the work of mercy to which we ought to apply ourselves, in order that men may attain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and escape <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reason and benevolence compel us to give such aid to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in order to secure for them a safety which is not only temporal, but very short&mdash;for the brief space of their life on earth?</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>35. As to the charge that they bring against us, that we <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> and plunder their possessions, I would that they would become <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, and possess in peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with us, not only what they call theirs, but also what confessedly belongs to us. But they are so blinded with the desire of uttering <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, that they do not observe how inconsistent their statements are with one another. At any rate, they assert, and seem to make it a subject of most invidious complaint among themselves, that we constrain them to come in to our communion by the violent authority of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>&mdash;which we certainly should not do by any means, if we wished to gain possession of their property. What avaricious man ever wished for another to share his possessions? Who that was inflamed with the desire of empire, or elated by the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of its possession, ever wished to have a partner? Let them at any rate look on those very men who once belonged to them, but now are our brethren joined to us by the bond of fraternal affection, and see how they hold not only what they used to have, but also what was ours, which they did not have before; which yet, if we are living as poor in fellowship with poor, belongs to us and them alike; while, if we possess of our private means enough for our wants, it is no longer ours, inasmuch as we do not commit so <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> an act of usurpation as to claim for our own the property of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, for whom we are in some sense the trustees.

<p>36. Everything, therefore, that was held in the name of the churches of the party of Donatus, was ordered by the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors, in their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, to pass to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with the possession of the buildings themselves.  Seeing, then, that there are with us poor members of those said churches who used to be maintained by these same paltry possessions, let them rather cease themselves to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> what belongs to others while they remain outside, and so let them enter within the bond of unity, that we may all alike administer, not only the property which they call their own, but also with it what is asserted to be ours. For it is written "All are yours; and you are Christ's; and Christ is God's." <span class="stiki" id="note142530"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:22-23</a></span> Under Him as our Head, let us all be one in His one body; and in all such matters as you speak of, let us follow the example which is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles: "They were of one heart and of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>: neither said any of them that anything of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common." <span class="stiki" id="note142531"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse32">Acts&nbsp;4:32</a></span> Let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what we sing: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"  that so they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, by their own experience, with what perfect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> their mother, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, calls out to them what the blessed apostle writes to the Corinthians: "I seek not yours, but you." <span class="stiki" id="note142533"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:14</a></span> </p>

<p>37. But if we consider what is said in the Book of Wisdom, "Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly;" <span class="stiki" id="note142534"><a href="../bible/wis010.htm#verse20">Wisdom&nbsp;10:20</a></span> and also what is said in the Proverbs, "The <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of the sinner is laid up for the just;" <span class="stiki" id="note142535"><a href="../bible/pro013.htm#verse22">Proverbs&nbsp;13:22</a></span> then we shall see that the question is not, who are in possession of the property of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>? But who are in the society of the just? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, indeed, that the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> arrogate to themselves such a store of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, that they boast not only that they possess it, but that they also bestow it upon other men. For they say that any one whom they have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is justified by them, after which there is nothing left for them but to say to the person who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by them that he must needs <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in him who has administered the sacrament; for why should he not do so, when the apostle says, "To him that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Him that justifies the ungodly, his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is counted for righteousness?" <span class="stiki" id="note142536"><a href="../bible/rom004.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;4:5</a></span> Let him <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, therefore, upon the man by whom he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, if it be none else that justifies him, that his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be counted for righteousness. But I think that even they themselves would look with horror on themselves, if they ventured for a moment to entertain such thoughts as these. For there is none that is just and able to justify, save God alone. But the same might be said of them that the apostle says of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that "being <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note142537"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;10:3</a></span> </p>

<p>38. But far be it from us that any one of our number should call himself in such wise just, that he should either go about to establish his own righteousness, as though it were conferred upon him by himself, whereas it is said to him, "For what have you that you did not receive?" <span class="stiki" id="note142538"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> or venture to boast himself as being without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in this world, as the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> themselves declared in our conference that they were members of a Church which has already neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing, <span class="stiki" id="note142539"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> &mdash; not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that this is only fulfilled in those individuals who depart out of this body immediately after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or after the forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, for which we make petition in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; but that for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as a whole, the time will not come when it shall be altogether without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, till the day when we shall hear the words, "O death, where is your sting? O grave, where is your victory?

<p>39. But in this life, when the corruptible body presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note142541"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> if their Church is already of such a character as they maintain, they would not utter unto God the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> which our Lord has taught us to employ: "Forgive us our debts." <span class="stiki" id="note142542"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> For since all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> have been remitted in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, why does the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> make this petition, if already, even in this life, it has neither spot nor wrinkle, nor any such thing? They would also have a fight to despise the warning of the Apostle John, when he cries out in his epistle, "If we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us. But if we confess our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He is faithful and just to forgive us our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." <span class="stiki" id="note142543"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8-9</a></span> On account of this hope, the universal Church utters the petition, "Forgive us our debts," that when He sees that we are not vainglorious, but ready to confess our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, He may cleanse us from all unrighteousness, and that so the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> may show to Himself in that day a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, which now He cleanses with the washing of water in the word: because, on the one hand, there is nothing that remains behind in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to hinder the forgiveness of every bygone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (so long, that is, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not received to no effect without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but is either administered within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or, at least, if it has been already administered without, the recipient does not remain outside with it); and, on the other hand, whatever pollution of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, of whatsoever kind, is contracted through the weakness of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by those who live here after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, is cleansed away in virtue of the same laver's efficacy. For neither is it of any avail for one who has not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> to say, "Forgive us our debts."</p>

<p>40. Accordingly, He so now cleanses His Church by the washing of water in the word, that He may hereafter show it to Himself as not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing&mdash;altogether beautiful, that is to say, and in absolute perfection, when death shall be "swallowed up in victory." <span class="stiki" id="note142544"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse54">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:54</a></span> Now, therefore, in so far as the life is flourishing within us that proceeds from our being born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, living by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so far we are righteous; but in so far as we drag along with us the traces of our mortal nature as derived from Adam, so far we cannot be free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> both in the statement that "whosoever is born of God does not commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note142545"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:9</a></span> and also in the former statement, that "if we say that we have no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we deceive ourselves, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is not in us." <span class="stiki" id="note142546"><a href="../bible/1jo001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;1:8</a></span> The Lord Jesus, therefore, is both righteous and able to justify; but we are justified freely by no other <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> than His. <span class="stiki" id="note142547"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;3:24</a></span> For there is nothing that justifies save His body, which is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and therefore, if the body of Christ bears off the spoils of the unrighteous, and the riches of the unrighteous are laid up in store as treasures for the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the unrighteous ought not therefore to remain outside, but rather to enter within, that so they may be justified.</p>

<p>41. Whence also we may be sure that what is written concerning the day of judgment, "Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labors," <span class="stiki" id="note142548"><a href="../bible/wis005.htm#verse1">Wisdom&nbsp;5:1</a></span> is not to be taken in such a sense as that the Canaanite shall stand before the face of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, though <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> made no account of the labors of the Canaanite; but only as that Naboth shall stand before the face of Ahab, since Ahab made no account of the labors of Naboth, since the Canaanite was unrighteous, while Naboth was a righteous man. In the same way the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> shall not stand before the face of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, who made no account of his labors, when the temples of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were plundered and destroyed; but the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> shall stand before the face of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, who made no account of his labors, when the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were laid low in death. In the same way, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> shall not stand in the face of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, who made no account of his labors, when the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> emperors were put in force; but the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> shall stand in the face of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, who made no account of his labors when the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the ungodly Circumcelliones was allowed to have its way. For the passage of Scripture decides the question in itself, seeing that it does not say, Then shall men stand, but "Then shall the righteous stand;" and they shall stand "in great boldness" because they stand in the power of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>.</p>

<p>42. But in this world no one is righteous by his own righteousness&mdash;that is, as though it were wrought by himself and for himself; but as the apostle says, "According as God has dealt to every man the measure of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>." But then he goes on to add the following: "For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office; so we, being many, are one body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note142549"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;12:3-5</a></span> And according to this doctrine, no one can be righteous so long as he is separated from the unity of this body. For in the same manner as if a limb be cut off from the body of a living man, it cannot any longer retain the spirit of life; so the man who is cut off from the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who is righteous, can in no wise retain the spirit of righteousness, even if he retain the form of membership which he received when in the body. Let them therefore come into the framework of this body, and so possess their own labors, not through the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of lordship, but through the godliness of using them aright. But we, as has been said before, cleanse our wills from the pollution of this concupiscence, even in the judgment of any enemy you please to name as judge, seeing that we use our utmost efforts in entreating the very men of whose labors we avail ourselves to enjoy with us, within the society of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the fruits both of their labors and of our own.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>43. But this, they say, is the very thing which disquiets us&mdash;If we are unrighteous, wherefore do you seek our company? To which question we answer, We seek the company of you who are unrighteous, that you may not remain unrighteous; we seek for you who are lost, that we may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> over you as soon as you are found, saying, This our brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. <span class="stiki" id="note142550"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;15:32</a></span> Why, then, he says, do you not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> me, that you might wash me from my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? I reply: Because I do not do despite to the stamp of the monarch, when I correct the ill-doing of a deserter. Why, he says, do I not even do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> in your body? Nay <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, unless you have done penance, you cannot be saved; for how shall you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that you have been reformed, unless you first grieve that you had been astray? What, then, he says, do we receive with you, when we come over to your side? I answer, You do not indeed receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which was able to exist in you outside the framework of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although it could not profit you; but you receive the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace <span class="stiki" id="note142551"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> without which no one can see <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and you receive charity, which, as it is written, "shall cover the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note142552"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> And in regard to this great blessing, without which we have the apostle's testimony that neither the tongues of men or of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor the understanding of all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, nor the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> so great as to be able to remove mountains, nor the bestowal of all one's goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, nor giving one's body to be burned, can profit anything; <span class="stiki" id="note142553"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:1-3</a></span> if, I say, you think this mighty blessing to be worthless or of trifling value, you are deservedly but miserably astray; and deservedly you must necessarily perish, unless you come over to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity.

<p>44. If, then, they say, it is necessary that we should repent of having been outside, and hostile to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if we would gain <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, how comes it that after the repentance which you exact from us we still continue to be <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, or it may be even <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in your body? This would not be the case, as indeed, in simple <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we must confess it should not be the case, were it not that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is cured by the compensating power of peace itself. But let them give themselves this lesson, and most especially let those feel sorrow in their hearts, who are lying in this deep death of severance from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that they may recover their life even by this sort of wound inflicted on our <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> mother Church. &nbsp;For when the bough that has been cut off is grafted in, a new wound is made in the tree, to admit of its reception, that life may be given to the branch which was perishing for lack of the life that is furnished by the root. But when the newly-received branch has become identified with the stock in which it is received, the result is both vigor and fruit; but if they do not become identified, the engrafted bough withers, but the life of the tree continues unimpaired. For there is further a mode of grafting of such a kind, that without cutting away any branch that is within, the branch that is foreign to the tree is inserted, not indeed without a wound, but with the slightest possible wound inflicted on the tree. In like manner, then, when they come to the root which exists in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, without being deprived of any position which belongs to them as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> or <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> after ever so deep repentance of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, there is a kind of wound inflicted as it were upon the bark of the mother tree, breaking in upon the strictness of her discipline; but since neither he that plants is anything, neither he that waters, <span class="stiki" id="note142554"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:7</a></span> so soon as by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> poured forth to the mercy of God peace is secured through the union of the engrafted boughs with the parent stock, charity then covers the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>45. For although it was made an ordinance in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that no one who had been called upon to do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for any offense should be admired into <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> orders, or return to or continue in the body of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>,  this was done not to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> despair of any indulgence being granted, but merely to maintain a rigorous discipline; otherwise an argument will be raised against the keys that were given to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which we have the testimony of Scripture: "Whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven." <span class="stiki" id="note142556"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;16:19</a></span> But lest it should so happen that, after the detection of offenses, a heart swelling with the hope of <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> preferment might do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> in a spirit of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, it was determined, with great severity, that after doing penance for any mortal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, no one should be admitted to the number of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, in order that, when all hope of temporal preferment was done away, the medicine of humility might be endowed with greater strength and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For even the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David did penance for deadly <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and yet was not degraded from his office. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the blessed Peter, after shedding the bitterest of tears, repented that he had denied his Lord, and yet remained an apostle. But we must not therefore be induced to think that the care of those in later times was in any way superfluous, who, when there was no risk of endangering <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, added something to humiliation, in order that the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> might be more thoroughly protected&mdash;having, I suppose, experienced a feigned repentance on the part of some who were influenced by the desire of the power attaching to office. For experience in many diseases necessarily brings in the invention of many remedies. But in cases of this kind, when, owing to the serious ruptures of dissensions in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is no longer a question of danger to this or that particular individual, but whole nations are lying in ruin, it is right to yield a little from our severity, that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> charity may give her aid in healing the more serious <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>.</p>

<p>46. Let them therefore feel bitter grief for their detestable <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the past, as Peter did for his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that led him into <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and let them come to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> our mother; let them be in it <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, let them be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> unto its profit, as they have been hitherto in enmity against it. We feel no jealousy towards them, nay, we embrace them; we wish, we advise, we even compel those to come in whom we find in the highways and hedges, although we fail as yet in persuading some of them that we are seeking not their property, but themselves. The Apostle Peter, when he denied his Savior, and wept, and did not cease to be an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, had not as yet received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> that was promised; but much more have these men not received Him, when, being severed from the framework of the body, which is alone enlivened by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, they have usurped the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and in hostility to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have fought against us in a kind of civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, with our own arms and our own standards raised in opposition to us. Let them come; let peace be concluded in the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of Jerusalem, which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity,&mdash; to which <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> city it is said, "Peace be in your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and plenteousness within your palaces."  Let them not exalt themselves against the solicitude of their mother, which she both has entertained and does entertain with the object of gathering within her bosom themselves, and all the mighty nations whom they are, or recently were, deceiving; at them not be puffed up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, that she receives them in such wise; let them not attribute to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of their own exaltation the good which she on her part does in order to make peace.</p>

<p>47. So it has been her wont to come to the aid of multitudes who were perishing through schisms and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. This displeased Lucifer,  when it was carried out in receiving and healing those who had perished beneath the poison of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>; and, being displeased at it, he fell into the darkness of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, losing the light of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity. In accordance with this principle the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Africa has recognized the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> from the very beginning, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> herein the decree of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who gave sentence in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> between C&aelig;cilianus and the party of Donatus; and having condemned one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Donatus,  who was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been the author of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, they determined that the others should be received, after correction, with full recognition of their orders even if they had been ordained outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash;not that they could have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> even outside the unity of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but, in the first place, for the sake of those whom it was possible they might deceive while they remained outside, and prevent from obtaining that gift; and, secondly, that their own weakness also being mercifully received within, might thus be rendered capable of cure, no obstinacy any longer standing in the way to close their eyes against the evidence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For what other intention could have given rise to their own conduct, when they received with full recognition of their orders the followers of Maximianus, whom they had condemned as guilty of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, as their council  shows, and to fill whose places they had already ordained other men, when they saw that the people did not depart from their company, that all might not be involved in ruin? And on what other ground did they neither speak against nor question the validity of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which had been administered outside by men whom they had condemned? Why, then, do they wonder, why do they complain, and make it the subject of their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, that we receive them in such wise to promote the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, while yet they do not remember what they themselves have done to promote the false peace of Donatus, which is opposed to Christ? For if this act of theirs be borne in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and intelligently used in argument against them, they will have no answer whatsoever that they can make.</p>
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>48. But as to what they say, arguing as follows: If we have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in that we have treated your <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> with contempt, why is it that you seek us, seeing that we cannot possibly receive remission of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as the Lord says, "Whosoever speaks against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come?" <span class="stiki" id="note142561"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;12:32</a></span> &mdash; they do not perceive that according to their interpretation of the passage none can be delivered. For who is there that does not speak against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against him, whether we take the case of one who is not yet a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, or of one who shares in the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, or of Eunomius, or of Macedonius, who all say that He is a creature; or of Photinus, who denies that He has any substance at all, saying that there is only one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father; or of any of the other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, whom it would now take too long a time to mention in detail? Are none, therefore, of these to be delivered? Or if the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves, against whom the Lord directed His reproach, were to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, would they not be allowed to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? For the Saviour does not say, Shall be forgiven in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: but "Shall not be forgiven, neither in this world, neither in the world to come."

<p>49. Let them understand, therefore, that it is not every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but only some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is incapable of forgiveness. For just as when our Lord said, "If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note142562"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;15:22</a></span> it is clear that He did not wish it to be understood that they would have been free from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since they were filled with many grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but that they would have been free from some special <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the absence of which would have left them in a position to receive remission of all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which yet remained in them, viz., the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of not believing in Him when He came to them; for they could not have had this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, had He not come. In like manner, also, when He said, "Whosoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,"or, "Whosoever speaks against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>;" it is clear that He does not refer to every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of whatsoever kind against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, in word or deed, but would have us understand some special and peculiar <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But this is the hardness of heart even to the end of this life, which leads a man to refuse to accept remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in the unity of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to which life is given by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For when He had said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> "Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," immediately added, Whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they are retained." <span class="stiki" id="note142563"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22-23</a></span> Whosoever therefore has resisted or fought against this gift of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or has been estranged from it in any way whatever to the end of this mortal life, shall not receive the remission of that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, either in this world, or in the world to come, seeing that it is so great a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that in it is included every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but it cannot be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been committed by any one, till he has passed away from life. But so long as he lives here, "the goodness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," as the apostle says, "is leading him to repentance;" but if he deliberately, with the utmost perseverance in iniquity, as the apostle adds in the succeeding verse, "after his hardness and impenitent heart, treasures up unto himself <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against the day of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> and revelation of the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note142564"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;2:4-5</a></span> he shall not receive forgiveness, neither in this world, neither in that which is to come.</p>

<p>50. But those with whom we are arguing, or about whom we are arguing, are not to be despaired of, for they are yet in the body; but they cannot seek the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, except in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of which they possess the outward sign outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but they do not possess the actual reality itself within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of which that is the outward sign, and therefore they eat and drink damnation to themselves. <span class="stiki" id="note142565"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> For there is but one bread which is the sacrament of unity, seeing that, as the apostle says, "We, being many, are one bread, and one body." <span class="stiki" id="note142566"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:17</a></span> Furthermore, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone is the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of which He is the Head and Saviour of His body. <span class="stiki" id="note142567"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;5:23</a></span> Outside this body the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> gives life to no one seeing that, as the apostle says himself, "The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given unto us;" <span class="stiki" id="note142568"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> but he is not a partaker of the divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> who is the enemy of unity. Therefore they have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> who are outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for it is written of them, "They separate themselves being sensual, having not the Spirit." <span class="stiki" id="note142569"><a href="../bible/jud001.htm#verse19">Jude&nbsp;19</a></span> But neither does he receive it who is insincerely in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since this is also the intent of what is written: "For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of discipline will flee deceit." <span class="stiki" id="note142570"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom&nbsp;1:5</a></span> If any one, therefore, wishes to receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, let him beware of continuing in alienation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let him beware of entering it in the spirit of dissimulation; or if he has already entered it in such wise, let him beware of persisting in such dissimulation, in order that he may <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and indeed become united with the tree of life.</p>

<p>51. I have dispatched to you a somewhat lengthy epistle, which may prove burdensome among your many occupations. If, therefore, it may be read to you even in portions, the Lord will grant you understanding, that you may have some answer which you can make for the correction and healing of those men who are commended to you as to a faithful son by our mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that you may correct and heal them, by the aid of the Lord wherever you can, and howsoever you can, either by speaking and replying to them in your own person, or by bringing them into communication with the doctors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
