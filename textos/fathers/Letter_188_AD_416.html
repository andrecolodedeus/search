<h1>Letter 188 (A.D. 416)</h1>

<p> <em>To the Lady Juliana, Worthy to Be Honoured in Christ with the Service Due to Her Rank, Our Daughter Deservedly Distinguished, Alypius and Augustine Send Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. Lady, worthy to be honoured in Christ with the service due to your rank, and daughter deservedly distinguished, it was very pleasant and agreeable to us that your letter reached us when together at Hippo, so that we might send this joint reply to you, to express our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in hearing of your welfare, and with sincere reciprocation of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to let you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of our welfare, in which we are sure that you take an affectionate interest. We are well aware that you are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> how great <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> affection we consider due to you, and how much, both before God and among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, we are interested in you. For though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you, at first by letter, afterwards by personal intercourse, to be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, that is, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> members of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nevertheless, our <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> ministry also was of use to you, for when you had received the word of God from us, <q>you received it,</q> as says the apostle, <q>not as the word of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but as it is in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112833"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> Through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, so great was the fruit arising from this ministery of ours in your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, that when preparations for her marriage  were already completed, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Demetrias preferred the spiritual embrace of that Husband who is fairer than the sons of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and in espousing themselves to whom <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> retain their <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and gain more abundant spiritual fruitfulness. We should not, however, yet have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> how this exhortation of ours had been received by the faithful and noble maiden, as we departed shortly before she took on her the vow of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, had we not learned from the joyful announcement and reliable testimony of your letter, that this great gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, planted and watered indeed by means of His servants, but owing its increase to Himself, had been granted to us as labourers in His vineyard.</p>

<p>2. Since these things are so, no one may charge us with presuming, if, on the ground of this closer spiritual relation, we manifest our solicitude for your welfare by warning you to avoid opinions opposed to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For though the apostle commands us in preaching the word to be <q>instant in season and out of season,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112835"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:2</a></span> yet we do not reckon you among the number of those to whom a word or a letter from us exhorting you carefully to avoid what is inconsistent with sound doctrine would seem <q>out of season.</q> Hence it was that you received our admonition in so kindly a manner, that, in the letter to which we are now replying, you say, <q>I thank you heartily for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> advice which your Reverence gave me, not to lend an ear to those men who, by their mischievous writings, often corrupt our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q></p>

<p>3. In this letter you go on to say, <q>But your Reverence <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that I and my household are entirely separated from <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of this description; and all our <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> follow so strictly the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as never at any time to have wandered from it, or fallen into any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>&mdash;I speak not of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> who have erred in a measure hardly admiting of expiation, but of those whose <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> seem to be trivial.</q> This statement renders it more and more necessary for us, in writing to you, not to pass over in silence the conduct of those who are attempting to corrupt even those who are sound in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We consider your house to be no insignificant Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, nor indeed is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of those men trivial who think that we have of ourselves whatever righteousness, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is in us, on the ground that God has so formed us, that beyond the revelation which He has given He imparts to us no further aid for performing by our own choice those things which by study we have ascertained to be our duty; declaring nature and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to be the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the only aid for living righteously and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>. For the possession, indeed, of a will inclined to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, whence proceed the life of uprightness and that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which so far excels all other gifts that God Himself is said to be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and by which alone is fulfilled in us as far as we fulfil them, the divine law and council,&mdash; for the possession, I say, of such a will, they hold that we are not indebted to the aid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but affirm that we ourselves of our own will are sufficient for these things. Let it not appear to you a trifling <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that men should wish to profess themselves <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and yet be unwilling to hear the apostle of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who, having said, <q>The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts,</q> lest any one should think that he had this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> through his own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, immediately subjoined, <q>by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> who is given unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112836"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Understand, then, how greatly and how fatally that man <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> who does not acknowledge that this is the <q>great gift of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112837"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse7">Ephesians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> who, when He ascended on high, <q>led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>4. How, then, could we so far conceal our <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> feelings as not to warn you, in whom we feel so deep an interest, to beware of such doctrines, after we had read a certain book addressed to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Demetrias? Whether this book has reached you,  and who is its author, we are desirous to hear in your answer to this. In this book, were it lawful for such a one to read it, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of Christ would read that her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and all her spiritual riches are to spring from no other source than herself, and thus, before she attains to the perfection of blessedness, she would learn&mdash;which may God forbid!&mdash; to be ungrateful to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the words addressed to her in the said book are these:&mdash; <q>You have here, then, those things on account of which you are deservedly, nay more, more especially to be preferred before others; for your earthly rank and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> are understood to be derived from your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, not from yourself, but your spiritual riches no one can have conferred on you but yourself; for these, then, you are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> to be praised, for these you are deservedly  to be preferred to others, for they can exist only from yourself, and in yourself.</q> </p>

<p>5. You see, doubtless, how dangerous is the doctrine in these words, against which you must be on your guard. For the affirmation, indeed, that these spiritual riches can exist only in yourself, is very well and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said: that evidently is food; but the affirmation that they cannot exist except from you is unmixed poison. Far be it from any virgin of Christ willingly to listen to statements like these. Every virgin of Christ understands the innate poverty of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart, and therefore declines to have it adorned otherwise than by the gifts of her Spouse. Let her rather listen to the apostle when he says: <q>I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112841"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2-3</a></span> And therefore in regard to these spiritual riches let her listen, not to him who says: <q>No one can confer them on you except yourself, and they cannot exist except from you and in you;</q> but to him who says: <q>We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not of us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112842"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> </p>

<p>6. In regard to that sacred virginal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, also, which does not belong to her from herself, but is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, bestowed, however, on her who is believing and willing, let her hear the same truthful and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> teacher, who when he treats of this subject says: <q>I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as I myself: but every man has his proper gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one after this manner, and another after that.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112843"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> Let her hear also Him who is the only Spouse, not only of herself, but of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, thus speaking of this <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and purity: <q>All cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112844"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;19:11</a></span> that she may understand that for her possession of this so great and excellent gift, she ought rather to render thanks to our God and Lord, than to listen to the words of any one who says that she possessed it from herself&mdash;words which we may not designate as those of a flatterer seeking to please, lest we seem to judge rashly concerning the hidden thoughts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but which are assuredly those of a misguided eulogist. For <q>every good gift and every perfect gift,</q> as the Apostle James says, <q>is from above, and comes down from the Father of Lights;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112845"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;1:17</a></span> from this source, therefore, comes this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, in which you who approve of it, and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in it, have been excelled by your daughter, who, coming after you in birth, has gone before you in conduct; descended from you in lineage, has risen above you in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; following you in age, has gone beyond you in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; in whom also that begins to be yours which could not be in your own person. For she did not contract an earthly marriage, that she might be, not for herself only, but also for you, spiritually enriched, in a higher degree than yourself, since you, even with this addition, are inferior to her, because you contracted the marriage of which she is the offspring. These things are gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are yours, indeed, but are not from yourselves; for you have this treasure in earthly bodies, which are still frail as the vessels of the potter, that the excellency of the power may be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not of you. And be not surprised because we say that these things are yours, and not from you, for we speak of <q>daily bread</q> as ours, but yet add, <span class="stiki" id="note112846"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;11:3</a></span> <q>give it to us,</q> lest it should be thought that it was from ourselves.</p>

<p>7. Wherefore <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the precept of Scripture, <q>Pray without ceasing. In everything give thanks;</q>  for you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in order that you may have constantly and increasingly these gifts, you render thanks because you have them not of yourself. For who separates you from that mass of death and perdition derived from Adam? Is it not He <q>who came to seek and to save that which was lost?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112848"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span> Was, then, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, indeed, on hearing the apostle's question, <q>Who makes you to differ?</q> to reply, <q>My own good will, my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, my righteousness,</q> and to disregard what immediately follows? <q>What have you that you did not receive? Now, if you received it, why do you <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if you had not received it?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112849"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> We are unwilling, then, yea, utterly unwilling, that a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgin, when she hears or reads these words: <q>Your spiritual riches no one can have conferred on you; for these you are <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> to be praised, for these you are deservedly to be preferred to others, for they can exist only from yourself, and in yourself,</q> should thus boast of her riches as if she had not received them. Let her say, indeed, <q>In me are Your vows, O <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I will render praises unto You;</q>  but since they are <em>in</em> her, not <em>from</em> her, let her remember also to say, <q>Lord, by Your will You have furnished strength to my beauty,</q>  because, though it be from her, inasmuch as it is the acting of her own will, without which we cannot do what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, yet we are not to say, as he said, that it is <q>only from her.</q> For our own will, unless it be aided by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, cannot alone be even in name good will, for, says the apostle, <q>it is God who works in us, both to will, and to do according to good will,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112852"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;2:13</a></span> &mdash; not, as these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> think, merely by revealing <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what we ought to do, but also by inspiring <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that we may also by choice perform the things which by study we have learned.</p>

<p>8. For doubtless the value of the gift of continence was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to him who said, <q>I perceived that no man can be continent unless God bestowed the gift.</q> He not only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> then how great a benefit it was, and how eagerly it ought to be <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a>, but also that, unless God gave it, it could not exist; for wisdom had taught him this for he says, This also was a point of wisdom, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whose gift it was; and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> did not suffice him, but he says, <q>I went to the Lord and made my supplication to Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112853"><a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse21">Wisdom&nbsp;8:21</a></span> God then aids us in this matter, not only by making us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is to be done, but also by making us do through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what we already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> through learning. No one, therefore, can possess, not only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also continence, unless God give it to him. Whence it was that when he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that he might have continence, that it might be in him, because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was not from him; or if on account of the freedom of his will it was in a certain sense from himself, yet it was not from himself alone, because no one can be continent unless God bestow on him the gift. But he whose opinions I am censuring, in speaking of spiritual riches, among which is doubtless that bright and beautiful gift of continence, does not say that they may exist in you, and from yourself, but says that they can exist <em> only</em> from you, and in you, in such a way that, as a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of Christ has these things nowhere else than in herself, so it can be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> possible for her to have them from no other source than from herself, and in this way (which may a merciful God avert from her heart!) she shall so boast as if she had not received them!</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>9. We indeed hold such an opinion concerning the training of this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin, and the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> humility in which she was nourished and brought up, as to be assured that when she read these words, if she did read, them, she would break out into lamentations, and humbly smite her breast, and perhaps burst into tears, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the Lord to whose service she was dedicated and by whom she was sanctified, pleading with Him that these were not her own words, but another's, and asking that her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might not be such as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that she had anything whereof to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in herself and not in the Lord. For her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is in herself, not in the words of another, as the apostle says: <q>Let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> (rejoicing) in himself alone, and not in another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112854"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse4">Galatians&nbsp;6:4</a></span> But God forbid that her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> should be in herself, and not in Him to whom the Psalmist says, <q>You are my <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the lifter up of mine head.</q>  For her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is then profitably in herself, when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is in her, is Himself her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, from whom she has every good, by which she is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and shall have all things by which she shall be made better, in as far as she may become better in this life, and by which she shall be made perfect when rendered so by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a>, not by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> praise. <q>For her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be praised in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,</q>  <q>who satisfies her desire with <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things,</q>  because He Himself has inspired this desire, that His virgin should not boast of any good, as if she had not received it.</p>

<p>10. Inform us, then, in reply to this letter, whether we have judged <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in supposing these to be your daughter's sentiments. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> well that you and all your <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> are, and have been, worshippers of the indivisible Trinity. But <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> insinuates itself in other forms than in erroneous opinions concerning the indivisible Trinity. There are other subjects also, in regard to which men fall into very dangerous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. As, for example, that of which we have spoken in this letter at greater length, perhaps, than might have sufficed to a person of your steadfast and pure wisdom. And yet we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not to whom, except to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore to the Trinity, wrong is done by the man who denies that the good that comes from God is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may God avert from you, as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> He does! May God altogether forbid that the book out of which we have thought it our duty to extract some words, that they might be more easily understood, should produce any such impression, we do not say on your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or on that of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin your daughter, but on the mind of the least deserving of your male or female servants.</p>

<p>11. But if you study more carefully even those words in which the writer appears to speak in favour of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or the aid of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you will find them so ambiguous that they may have reference either to nature or to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or to forgiveness of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. For even in regard to that which they are forced to acknowledge, that we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may not enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, they may consider that the words mean that we are so far helped to it that, by our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and knocking, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is so revealed to us that we may learn what it is our duty to do, not so far as that our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> receives strength, whereby we may do that which we learn to be our duty; and as to their saying that it is by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> or help of God that the Lord Christ has been set before us as an example of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> living, they interpret this so as to teach the same doctrine, affirming, namely, that we learn by His example how we ought to live, but denying that we are so aided as to do through <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> what we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by learning.</p>

<p>12. Find in this book, if you can, anything in which, excepting nature and the freedom of the will (which pertains to the same nature), and the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the revealing of doctrine, any such aid of God is acknowledged as that which he acknowledges who said: <q>When I perceived that no man can be continent unless God bestow the gift, and that this also is a point of wisdom to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whose gift it is, I went to the Lord, and made my supplication to Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112858"><a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse21">Wisdom&nbsp;8:21</a></span> For he did not desire to receive, in answer to his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, the nature in which he was made; nor was he solicitous to obtain the natural freedom of the will with which he was made; nor did he crave the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, seeing that he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> rather for continence, that he might not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; nor did he desire to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he ought to do, seeing that he already confessed that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> whose gift this continence was; but he wished to receive from the Spirit of wisdom such strength of will, such ardour of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as should suffice for fully practising the great <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of continence. If, therefore, you succeed in finding any such statement in that book, we will heartily thank you if, in your answer, you deign to inform us of it.</p>

<p>13. It is impossible for us to tell how greatly we desire to find in the writings of these men, whose works are read by very many for their pungency and eloquence, the open confession of that <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which the apostle vehemently commends, who says that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given to every man the measure of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112859"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;12:3</a></span> <q>without which it is impossible to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112860"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;11:6</a></span> <q>by which the just live,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112861"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;1:17</a></span> <q>which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112862"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> before which and without which no works of any man are in any respect to be reckoned good, since <q>whatsoever is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112863"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;14:23</a></span> He affirms that God distributes to every man, <span class="stiki" id="note112864"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;12:3</a></span> and that we receive divine assistance to live piously and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>, not only by the revelation of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which without charity <q>puffs up,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112865"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:1</a></span> but by our being inspired with that <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is the fulfilling of the law,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112866"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> and which so edifies our heart that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> does not puff it up. But hitherto I have failed to find any such statements in the writings of these men.</p>

<p>14. But especially we should wish that these sentiments should be found in that book from which we have quoted the words in which the author, praising a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of Christ as if no one except herself could confer on her spiritual riches, and as if these could not exist except from herself, does not wish her to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, but to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as if she had not received them. In this book, though it contain neither his name nor your own honoured name, he nevertheless mentions that a request had been made to him by the mother of the virgin to write to her. In a certain epistle of his, however, to which he openly attaches his name, and does not conceal the name of the sacred virgin, the same Pelagius says that he had written to her, and endeavours to prove, by appealing to the said work, that he most openly confessed the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he is alleged to have passed over in silence, or denied. But we beg you to condescend to inform us, in your reply, whether that be the very book in which he has inserted these words about spiritual riches, and whether it has reached your Holiness.</p>
