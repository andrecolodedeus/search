<h1>Letter 189 (A.D. 418)</h1>

<p> <em>To Boniface</em>,  <em>My Noble Lord and Justly Distinguished and Honourable Son, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. I had already written a reply to your Charity, but while I was waiting for an opportunity of forwarding the letter, my beloved son Faustus arrived here on his way to your Excellency. After he had received the letter which I had intended to be carried by him to your Benevolence, he stated to me that you were very desirous that I should write you something which might build you up unto the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of which you have hope in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>. And, although I was busily occupied at the time, he insisted, with an earnestness corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, he bears to you, that I should do this without delay. To meet his convenience, therefore, as he was in haste to depart, I thought it better to write, though necessarily without much time for reflection, rather than put off the gratification of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> desire, my noble lord and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> distinguished and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> son.</p>

<p>2. All is contained in these brief sentences: <q>Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and with all your strength: and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your neighbour as yourself;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112868"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;22:37-40</a></span> for these are the words in which the Lord, when on earth, gave an epitome of religion, saying in the gospel, <q>On these two commandments hang all the law and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q> Daily advance, then, in this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, both by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and by well-doing, that through the help of Him, who enjoined it on you, and whose gift it is, it may be nourished and increased, until, being perfected, it render you perfect. <q>For this is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which,</q> as the apostle says, <q>is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112869"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> This is <q>the fulfilling of the law;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112870"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> this is the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> works, of which he says again, <q>Neither <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> avails anything, nor uncircumcision; but <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112871"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse6">Galatians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> </p>

<p>3. In this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, then, all our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers, patriarchs, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> pleased God. In this all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> contended against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> even to the shedding of blood, and because in them it neither waxed cold nor failed, they became conquerors. In this all <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> daily make progress, seeking to acquire not an earthly kingdom, but the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; not a temporal, but an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> inheritance; not gold and silver, but the incorruptible riches of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; not the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of this life, which are enjoyed with trembling, and which no one can take with him when he dies, but the vision of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and power of imparting felicity transcend all beauty of form in bodies not only on earth but also in heaven, transcend all spiritual loveliness in men, however just and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, transcend all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and powers of the world above, transcend not only all that language can express, but all that thought can <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> concerning Him. And let us not despair of the fulfilment of such a great promise because it is exceeding great, but rather <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we shall receive it because He who has promised it is exceeding great, as the blessed Apostle John says: <q>Now are we the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112872"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Do not think that it is impossible for any one to please God while engaged in active military service. Among such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> was the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David, to whom God gave so great a testimony; among them also were many righteous men of that time; among them was also that centurion who said to the Lord: <q>I am not worthy that You should come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed: for I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it;</q> and concerning whom the Lord said: <q>Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, no, not in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112873"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;8:8-10</a></span> Among them was that Cornelius to whom an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said: <q>Cornelius, your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are accepted, and your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are heard,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112874"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;10:4</a></span> when he directed him to send to the blessed Apostle Peter, and to hear from him what he ought to do, to which apostle he sent a devout soldier, requesting him to come to him. Among them were also the soldiers who, when they had come to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John,&mdash; the sacred forerunner of the Lord, and the friend of the Bridegroom, of whom the Lord says: <q>Among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112875"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;11:11</a></span> &mdash; and had inquired of him what they should do, received the answer, <q>Do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to no man, neither accuse any <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>; and be content with your wages.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112876"><a href="../bible/luk003.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;3:14</a></span> Certainly he did not prohibit them to serve as soldiers when he commanded them to be content with their pay for the service.</p>

<p>5. They occupy indeed a higher place before God who, abandoning all these secular employments, serve Him with the strictest <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>; but <q>every one,</q> as the apostle says, <q>has his proper gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one after this manner, and another after that.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112877"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span> Some, then, in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for you, fight against your invisible enemies; you, in fighting for them, contend against the barbarians, their visible enemies. Would that one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in all, for then there would be less weary struggling, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> would be more easily conquered; but since it is necessary in this life that the citizens of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> should be subjected to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> among erring and impious men, that they may be exercised, and <q>tried as gold in the furnace,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112878"><a href="../bible/wis003.htm#verse6">Wisdom&nbsp;3:6</a></span> we ought not before the appointed time to desire to live with those alone who are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and righteous, so that, by patience, we may deserve to receive this blessedness in its proper time.</p>

<p>6. Think, then, of this first of all, when you are arming for the battle, that even your bodily strength is a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for, considering this, you will not employ the gift of God against God. For, when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is pledged, it is to be kept even with the enemy against whom the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is waged, how much more with the friend for whom the battle is fought! Peace should be the object of your desire; <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> should be waged only as a necessity, and waged only that God may by it deliver men from the necessity and preserve them in peace. For peace is not sought in order to the kindling of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, but <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is waged in order that peace may be obtained. Therefore, even in waging <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, cherish the spirit of a peacemaker, that, by conquering those whom you attack, you may lead them back to the advantages of peace; for our Lord says: <q>Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112879"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;5:9</a></span> If, however, peace among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> be so sweet as procuring temporal safety, how much sweeter is that peace with God which procures for men the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> felicity of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>! Let necessity, therefore, and not your will, slay the enemy who fights against you. As <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is used towards him who rebels and resists, so mercy is due to the vanquished or the captive, especially in the case in which future troubling of the peace is not to be feared.</p>

<p>7. Let the manner of your life be adorned by <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, sobriety, and moderation; for it is exceedingly disgraceful that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> should subdue him whom man finds invincible, and that wine should overpower him whom the sword assails in vain. As to worldly riches, if you do not possess them, let them not be sought after on earth by doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and if you possess them, let them by good works be laid up in heaven. The manly and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit ought neither to be elated by the accession, nor crushed by the loss of this world's treasures. Let us rather think of what the Lord says: <q>Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112880"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;6:21</a></span> and certainly, when we hear the exhortation to lift up our hearts, it is our duty to give unfeignedly the response which you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we are accustomed to give. </p>

<p>8. In these things, indeed, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are very careful, and the good report which I hear of you fills me with great delight, and moves me to congratulate you on account of it in the Lord. This letter, therefore, may serve rather as a mirror in which you may see what you are, than as a directory from which to learn what you ought to be: nevertheless, whatever you may discover, either from this letter or from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, to be still wanting to you in regard to a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, persevere in urgently seeking it both by effort and by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and for the things which you have, give thanks to God as the Fountain of goodness, whence you have received them; in every good action let the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> be given to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and humility be exercised by you, for, as it is written, <q>Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112882"><a href="../bible/jam001.htm#verse17">James&nbsp;1:17</a></span> But however much you may advance in the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of your neighbour, and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, do not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, as long as you are in this life, that you are without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for concerning this we read in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>: <q>Is not the life of man upon earth a life of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>?</q>  Wherefore, since always, as long as you are in this body, it is necessary for you to say in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as the Lord taught us: <q>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112884"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> remember quickly to forgive, if any one shall do you wrong and shall ask pardon from you, that you may be able to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> sincerely, and may prevail in seeking pardon for your own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<p>These things, my beloved friend, I have written to you in haste, as the anxiety of the bearer to depart urged me not to detain him; but I thank God that I have in some measure complied with your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wish. May the mercy of God ever protect you, my noble lord and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> distinguished son.</p>
