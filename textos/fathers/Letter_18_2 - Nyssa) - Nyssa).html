<h1>Letter 18</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. GREGORY OF NYSSA</em></strong></p>

<p> <em>To Flavian</em> </p>

<p>Things with us, O man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are not in a good way. The development of the bad feeling existing among certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have conceived a most groundless and unaccountable <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of us is no longer a matter of mere conjecture; it is now evinced with an earnestness and openness worthy only of some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> work. You meanwhile, who have hitherto been beyond the reach of such annoyance, are too remiss in stifling the devouring conflagration on your neighbour's land; yet those who are well-advised for their own interests really do take pains to check a fire close to them, securing themselves, by this help given to a neighbour, against ever needing help in like circumstances. Well, you will ask, what do I complain of? Piety has vanished from the world; Truth has fled from our midst; as for Peace, we used to have the name at all events going the round upon men's lips; but now not only does she herself cease to exist, but we do not even retain the word that expresses her. But that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more exactly the things that move our indignation, I will briefly detail to you the whole tragic story.</p>

<p>Certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> had informed me that the Right Reverend Helladius had unfriendly feelings towards me, and that he enlarged in conversation to every one upon the troubles that I had brought upon him. I did not at first <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what they said, judging only from myself, and the actual <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the matter. But when every one kept bringing to us a tale of the same strain, and facts besides corroborated their report, I thought it my duty not to continue to overlook this ill-feeling, while it was still without root and development. I therefore wrote by letter to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and to many others who could help me in my intention, and stimulated your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in this matter. At last, after I had concluded the services at Sebasteia in  commemoration of Peter  of most blessed memory, and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who had lived in his times, and whom the people were accustomed to commemorate with him, I was returning to my own See, when some one told me that Helladius himself was in the neighbouring mountain district, holding <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> memorial services. At first I held on my journey, judging it more proper that our meeting should take place in the metropolis itself. But when one of his relations took the trouble to meet me, and to assure me that he was sick, I left my carriage at the spot where this news arrested me; I performed on horseback the intervening journey over a road that was like a precipice, and nearly impassable with its rocky ascents. Fifteen milestones measured the distance we had to traverse. Painfully travelling, now on foot, now mounted, in the early morning, and even employing some part of the night, I arrived between twelve and one o'clock at Andumocina; for that was the name of the place where, with two other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he was holding his conference. From a shoulder of the hill overhanging this village, we looked down, while still at a distance, upon this outdoor assemblage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Slowly, and on foot, and leading the horses, I and my company passed over the intervening ground, and we arrived at the chapel  just as he had retired to his residence.</p>

<p>Without any delay a messenger was dispatched to inform him of our being there; and a very short while after, the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> in attendance on him met us, and we requested him to tell Helladius at once, so that we might spend as much time as possible with him, and so have an opportunity of leaving nothing in the misunderstanding between us unhealed. As for myself, I then remained sitting, still in the open air, and waited for the invitation indoors; and at a most inopportune time I became, as I sat there, a gazing stock to all the visitors at the conference. The time was long; drowsiness came on, and languor, intensified by the fatigue of the journey and the excessive heat of the day; and all these things, with people staring at me, and pointing me out to others, were so very distressing that in me the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> were realized: <q>My spirit within me was desolate. </q> I was kept in this state till noon, and heartily did I repent of this visit, and that I had brought upon myself this piece of discourtesy; and my own reflection vexed me worse than this injury done me by my enemies , warring as it did against itself, and changing into a regret that I had made the venture. At last the approach to the Altars was thrown open, and we were admitted to the sanctuary; the crowd, however, were excluded, though my <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> entered along with me, supporting with his arm my exhausted frame. I addressed his Lordship, and stood for a moment, expecting from him an invitation to be seated; but when nothing of the kind was heard from him, I turned towards one of the distant seats, and rested myself upon it, still expecting that he would utter something that was friendly, or at all events kind; or at least give one nod of recognition.</p>

<p>Any hopes I had were doomed to complete disappointment. There ensued a silence dead as night, and looks as downcast as in tragedy, and daze, and dumbfoundedness, and perfect dumbness. A long interval of time it was, dragged out as if it were in the blackness of night. So struck down was I by this reception, in which he did not deign to accord me the merest utterance even of those common salutations by which you discharge the courtesies of a chance meeting &mdash;<q>welcome,</q> for instance, or <q>where do you come from?</q> or <q>to what am I indebted for this pleasure?</q> or <q>on what important business are you here?</q>&mdash; that I was inclined to make this spell of silence into a picture of the life led in the underworld. Nay, I condemn the similitude as inadequate. For in that underworld the equality of conditions is complete, and none of the things that <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the tragedies of life on earth disturb <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, as the Prophet says, does not follow men down there; each individual <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, abandoning the things so eagerly clung to by the majority here, his petulance, and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and conceit, enters that lower world in simple unencumbered nakedness; so that none of the miseries of this life are to be found among them. Still , notwithstanding this reservation, my condition then did appear to me like an underworld, a murky dungeon, a gloomy torture-chamber; the more so, when I reflected what treasures of social courtesies we have inherited from our fathers, and what recorded <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of it we shall leave to our descendants. Why, indeed, should I speak at all of that affectionate disposition of our fathers towards each other? No wonder that, being all naturally equal , they wished for no advantage over one another, but thought to exceed each other only in humility. But my mind was penetrated most of all with this thought; that the Lord of all creation, the Only-begotten Son, Who was in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who was in the beginning, Who was in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who upholds all things by the word of His power, humbled Himself not only in this respect, that in the flesh He sojourned among men, but also that He welcomed even Judas His own betrayer, when he drew near to <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> Him, on His blessed lips; and that when He had entered into the house of Simon the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> He, as loving all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, upbraided his host, that He had not been kissed by him: whereas I was not reckoned by him as equal even to that <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a>; and yet what was I, and what was he? I cannot discover any difference between us. If one looks at it from the mundane point of view, where was the height from which he had descended, where was the dust in which I lay? If, indeed, one must regard things of this fleshly life, thus much perhaps it will hurt no one's feelings to assert that, looking at our lineage, whether as noble or as free, our position was about on a par; though, if one looked in either for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> freedom and nobility, <em>i.e.</em> that of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, each of us will be found equally a bondsman of Sin; each equally needs One Who will take away his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; it was Another Who ransomed us both from Death and Sin with His own blood, Who redeemed us, and yet showed no contempt of those whom He has redeemed, calling them though He does from deadness to life, and healing every infirmity of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> and bodies.</p>

<p>Seeing, then, that the amount of this conceit and overweening <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> was so great, that even the height of heaven was almost too narrow limits for it (and yet I could see no <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> or occasion whatever for this diseased state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, such as might make it excusable in the case of some who in certain circumstances contract it; when, for instance, rank or education, or pre-eminence in dignities of office may have happened to inflate the vainer minds), I had no means whereby to advise myself to keep quiet: for my heart within me was swelling with indignation at the absurdity of the whole proceeding, and was rejecting all the reasons for enduring it. Then, if ever, did I feel admiration for that divine Apostle who so vividly depicts the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> that rages within us, declaring that there is a certain <q>law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the members, warring against the law of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> and often making the mind a captive, and a slave as well, to itself. This was the very array, in opposition, of two contending feelings that I saw within myself: the one, of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> at the insult caused by <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, the other prompting to appease the rising storm. When by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, the worse inclination had failed to get the mastery, I at last said to him, <q>But is it, then, that some one of the things required for your personal comfort is being hindered by our presence, and is it time that we withdrew?</q> On his declaring that he had no bodily needs, I spoke to him some words calculated to heal, so far as in me lay, his ill-feeling. When he had, in a very few words, declared that the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> he felt towards me was owing to many injuries done him, I for my part answered him thus: <q>Lies possess an immense power among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to deceive: but in the Divine Judgment there will be no place for the misunderstandings thus arising. In my relations towards yourself, my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is bold enough to prompt me to hope that I may obtain forgiveness for all my other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but that, if I have acted in any way to harm you, this may remain for ever unforgiven.</q> He was indignant at this speech, and did not suffer the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of what I had said to be added.</p>

<p>It was now past six o'clock, and the bath had been well prepared, and the banquet was being spread, and the day was the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> , and a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> commemoration. Again observe how this <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> imitates the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: He, when eating and drinking with <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a> and sinners, answered to those who found fault with Him that He did it for <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>: this <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> considers it a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and a pollution to have us at his board, even after all that fatigue which we underwent on the journey, after all that excessive heat out of doors, in which we were baked while sitting at his gates; after all that gloomy sullenness with which he treated us to the bitter end, when we had come into his presence. He sends us off to toil painfully, with a frame now thoroughly exhausted with the over-fatigue, over the same distance, the same route: so that we scarcely reached our travelling company at sunset, after we had suffered many mishaps on the way. For a storm-cloud, gathered into a mass in the clear air by an eddy of wind, drenched us to the skin with its floods of rain; for owing to the excessive sultriness, we had made no preparation against any shower. However, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we escaped, though in the plight of shipwrecked sailors from the waves: and right glad were we to reach our company.</p>

<p>Having joined our forces we rested there that night, and at last arrived alive in our own district; having reaped in addition this result of our meeting him, that the memory of all that had happened before was revived by this last insult offered to us; and, you see, we are positively compelled to take measures, for the future, on our own behalf, or rather on his behalf; for it was because his designs were not checked on former occasions that he has proceeded to this unmeasured display of vanity. Something, therefore, I think, must be done on our part, in order that he may improve upon himself, and may be taught that he is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, and has no authority to insult and to disgrace those who possess the same beliefs and the same rank as himself. For just consider; suppose we granted for a moment, for the sake of argument, that it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that I have done something that has annoyed him, what trial  was instituted against us, to judge either of the fact or the hearsay? What <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> were given of this supposed injury? What Canons were cited against us? What legitimate episcopal decision confirmed any verdict passed upon us? And supposing any of these processes had taken place, and that in the proper way, my standing  in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> might certainly have been at stake, but what Canons could have sanctioned insults offered to a free-born person, and disgrace inflicted on one of equal rank with himself? <q>Judge righteous judgment,</q> you who look to God's law in this matter; say wherein you deem this disgrace put upon us to be excusable. If our dignity is to be estimated on the ground of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> jurisdiction, the privilege of each recorded by the Council  is one and the same; or rather the oversight of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> correction , from the fact that we possess an equal share of it, is so. But if some are inclined to regard each of us by himself, divested of any <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity, in what respect has one any advantage over the other; in education for instance, or in birth connecting with the noblest and most illustrious lineage, or in theology? These things will be found either equal, or at all events not inferior, in me. <q>But what about revenue?</q> he will say. I would rather not be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to speak of this in his case; thus much only it will suffice to say, that our own was so much at the beginning, and is so much now; and to leave it to others to enquire into the causes of this increase of our revenue , nursed as it is up till now, and growing almost daily by means of noble undertakings. What licence, then, has he to put an insult upon us, seeing that he has neither superiority of birth to show, nor a rank exalted above all others, nor a commanding power of speech, nor any previous kindness done to me? While, even if he had all this to show, the fault of having slighted those of gentle birth would still be inexcusable. But he has not got it; and therefore I deem it right to see that this malady of puffed-up <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> is not left without a cure; and it will be its cure to put it down to its proper level, and reduce its inflated dimensions, by letting off a little of the conceit with which he is bursting. The manner of effecting this we leave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. </p>
