<h1>Letter 18</h1>

<p class="c30"> <span class="c1">Letter XVIII. To Pope Damasus.</span> </p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This (written from Constantinople in A.D. 381) is the earliest of Jerome's expository letters. In it he explains at length the vision recorded in the sixth chapter of Isaiah, and enlarges upon its mystical meaning. <q>Some of my predecessors,</q> he writes, <q>make 'the Lord sitting upon a throne' <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and suppose the seraphim to represent the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. I do not agree with them, for John expressly tells us <span class="stiki" id="note300326"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse41">John&nbsp;12:41</a></span> that it was Christ and not the Father whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> saw.</q> And again, <q>The word seraphim means either 'glow' or 'beginning of speech,' and the two seraphim thus stand for the Old and New Testaments.  'Did not our heart burn within us,' said the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, 'while he opened to us the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>?' <span class="stiki" id="note300328"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;24:32</a></span> Moreover, the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> is written in Hebrew, and this unquestionably was man's original language.</q> Jerome then speaks of the unity of the sacred books. <q>Whatever,</q> he asserts, <q>we read in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> we find also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; and what we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is deduced from the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>.  There is no discord between them, no disagreement. In both Testaments the Trinity is preached.</q> </span> </p>

<p>The letter is noticeable for the evidence it affords of the thoroughness of Jerome's studies. Not only does he cite the several Greek versions of Isaiah in support of his argument, but he also reverts to the Hebrew original. So far as the West was concerned he may be said to have discovered this anew. Even <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> men like Augustine had ceased to look beyond the LXX., and were more or less aghast at the boldness with which Jerome rejected its time-<a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> but inaccurate renderings. </p>

<p>The letter also shows that independence of judgment which always marked Jerome's work. At the time when he wrote it he was much under the sway of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. But great as was his admiration for the master, he was not afraid to discard his exegesis when, as in the case of the seraphim, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> it to be erroneous.</p>
