<h1>Letter 191</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Amphilochius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Iconium</em>. </p>

<p>On reading the letter of your reverence I heartily thanked God. I did so because I found in your expressions traces of ancient affection. You are not like the majority. You did not persist in refusing to begin an affectionate correspondence. You have learned the greatness of the prize promised to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> for humility, and so you have chosen, by taking the second place, to get before me. Among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> such are the conditions of victory, and it is he who is content to take the second place who wins a crown. But I must not be behindhand in this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> rivalry, and so I thus salute your reverence in return; and inform you as to how I am minded, in that, since agreement in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is established among us,  there is nothing further to prevent our being one body and one spirit, as we have been called in one hope of our calling.  It is for you, then, of your charity to follow up a good beginning to rally men of like mind to stand at your side, and to appoint both time and place for meeting. Thus, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, through mutual accommodation we may govern the Churches by the ancient kind of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; receiving as our own members brothers coming from the other side, sending as to our kin, and in turn receiving as from our own kin. Such, indeed, was once the boast of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Brothers from each Church, travelling from one end of the world to the other, were provided with little tokens, and found all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> fathers and brothers. This is a privilege whereof, like all the rest, the enemy of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Churches has <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> us. We are confined each in his own city, and every one looks at his neighbour with distrust. What more is to be said but that our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> has grown cold, <span class="stiki" id="note322675"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12</a></span> whereby alone our Lord has told us that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are distinguished? <span class="stiki" id="note322676"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;13:35</a></span> First of all, if you will, do you become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to one another, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with whom I am to be in agreement. Thus by common consent we will fix on some place convenient to both, and, at a season suitable for travelling, we will hasten to meet one another; the Lord will direct us in the way. Farewell. Be of good cheer. Pray for me. May you be granted to me by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Holy One? </p>
