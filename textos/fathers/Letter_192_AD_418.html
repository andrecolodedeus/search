<h1>Letter 192 (A.D. 418)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Venerable Lord and Highly Esteemed and Holy Brother, C&aelig;lestine</em>,  <em>Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. I was at a considerable distance from home when the letter of your Holiness addressed to me at Hippo arrived by the hands of the clerk Projectus. When I had returned home, and, having read your letter, felt myself to be owing you a reply, I was still waiting for some means of communicating with you, when, lo! A most desirable opportunity presented itself in the departure of our very dear brother the acolyte Albinus, who leaves us immediately. Rejoicing, therefore, in your health, which is most earnestly desired by me, I return to your Holiness the salutation which I was owing. But I always owe you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the only debt which, even when it has been paid, holds him who has paid it a debtor still. For it is given when it is paid, but it is owing even after it has been given, for there is no time at which it ceases to be due. Nor when it is given is it lost, but it is rather multiplied by giving it; for in possessing it, not in parting with it, it is given. And since it cannot be given unless it is possessed, so neither can it be possessed unless it is given; nay, at the very time when it is given by a man it increases in that man, and, according to the number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to whom it is given, the amount of it which is gained becomes greater. Moreover, how can that be denied to friends which is due even to enemies? To enemies, however, this debt is paid with caution, whereas to friends it is repaid with confidence. Nevertheless, it uses every effort to secure that it receives back what it gives, even in the case of those to whom it renders good for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. For we wish to have as a friend the man whom, as an enemy, we <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, for we do not sincerely <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him unless we wish him to be good, which he cannot be until he be delivered from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of cherished enmities.</p>

<p>2. Love, therefore, is not paid away in the same manner as money; for, whereas money is diminished, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is increased by paying it away. They differ also in this&mdash;that we give evidence of greater goodwill to the man to whom we may have given money if we do not seek to have it returned; but no one can be a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> donor of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unless he lovingly insist on its repayment. For money, when it is received, accrues to him to whom it is given, but forsakes him by whom it is given; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, on the contrary, even when it is not repaid, nevertheless increases with the man who insists on its repayment by the person whom he loves; and not only so, but the person by whom it is returned to him does not begin to possess it till he pays it back again.</p>

<p>Wherefore, my lord and brother, I willingly give to you, and joyfully receive from you, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which we owe to each other. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which I receive I still claim, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which I give I still owe. For we ought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> with docility the precept of the One Master, whose <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> we both profess to be, when He says to us by His apostle: <q>Owe no man anything, but to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112889"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;13:8</a></span> </p>
