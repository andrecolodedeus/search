<h1>Letter 197</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Ambrose, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Milan</em>. </p>

<p>1. The gifts of the Lord are ever great and many; in greatness beyond measure, in number incalculable. To those who are not insensible of His mercy one of the greatest of these gifts is that of which I am now availing myself, the opportunity allowed us, far apart in place though we be, of addressing one another by letter. He grants us two means of becoming acquainted; one by personal intercourse, another by epistolary correspondence. Now I have become acquainted with you through what you have said. I do not mean that my memory is impressed with your outward appearance, but that the beauty of the inner man has been brought home to me by the rich variety of your utterances, for each of us <q>speaks out of the abundance of the heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322686"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;12:34</a></span> I have given <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who in every generation selects those who are well-pleasing to Him; Who of old indeed chose from the sheepfold a prince for His people;  Who through the Spirit gifted Amos the herdman with power and raised him up to be a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; Who now has drawn forth for the care of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> flock a man from the imperial city, entrusted with the government of a whole nation, exalted in character, in lineage, in position, in eloquence, in all that this world admires. This same man has flung away all the advantages of the world, counting them all loss that he may gain Christ, <span class="stiki" id="note322688"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;3:8</a></span> and has taken in his hand the helm of the ship, great and famous for its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Come, then, O man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not from men have you received or been taught the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of Christ; it is the Lord Himself who has transferred you from the judges of the earth to the throne of the Apostles; fight the good fight; heal the infirmity of the people, if any are infected by the disease of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; renew the ancient footprints of the Fathers. You have laid the foundation of affection towards me; strive to build upon it by the frequency of your salutations. Thus shall we be able to be near one another in spirit, although our earthly homes are far apart.</p>

<p>2. By your earnestness and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the matter of the blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Dionysius you testify all your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the Lord, your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> for your predecessors, and your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For our disposition towards our faithful fellow-servants is referred to the Lord Whom they have served. Whoever honours men that have contended for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> proves that he has like <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for it. One single action is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>I wish to acquaint your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in Christ that the very <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> brethren who have been commissioned by your reverence to act for you in this good work have won praise for all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> by the amiability of their manners; for by their individual modesty and conciliatoriness they have shown the sound condition of all. Moreover, with all <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and diligence they have braved an inclement season; and with unbroken perseverance have persuaded the faithful guardians of the blessed body to transmit to them the custody of what they have regarded as the safeguard of their lives. And you must understand that they are men who would never have been forced by any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authority or sovereignty, had not the perseverance of these brethren moved them to compliance. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> a great aid to the attainment of the object desired was the presence of our well beloved and reverend son Therasius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. He voluntarily undertook all the toil of the journey; he moderated the energy of the faithful on the spot; he persuaded opponents by his arguments; in the presence of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and of many others who <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord, he took up the relics with all becoming reverence, and has aided the brethren in their preservation. These relics do you receive with a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> equivalent to the distress with which their custodians have parted with them and sent them to you. Let none dispute; let none <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Here you have that unconquered athlete. These bones, which shared in the conflict with the blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. These bones He will crown, together with that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in the righteous day of His requital, as it is written, <q>we must stand before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that each may give an account of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> he has done in the body.</q>  One coffin held that honoured corpse. None other lay by his side. The burial was a noble one; the honours of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> were paid him. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who had welcomed him as a guest and then with their own hands laid him in the grave, have now disinterred him. They have wept as men bereaved of a father and a champion. But they have sent him to you, for they put your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> before their own consolation. Pious were the hands that gave; scrupulously careful were the hands that received. There has been no room for deceit; no room for guile. I bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to this. Let the untainted <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be accepted by you.</p>
