<h1>Letter 199</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p>Canonica Secunda.</p>

<p> <em>To Amphilochius, concerning the Canons</em>.</p>

<p>I wrote some time ago in reply to the questions of your reverence, but I did not send the letter, partly because from my long and dangerous illness I had not time to do so; partly because I had no one to send with it. I have but few men with me who are experienced in travelling and fit for service of this kind. When you thus learn the causes of my delay, forgive me. I have been quite astonished at your readiness to learn and at your humility. You are entrusted with the office of a teacher, and yet you condescend to learn, and to learn of me, who pretend to no great <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Nevertheless, since you consent, on account of your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to do what another man might hesitate to do, I am bound for my part to go even beyond my strength in aiding your readiness and righteous <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>.</p>

<p>XVII. You asked me about the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Bianor&mdash; can he be admitted among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, because of his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>? I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have already given the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> a general sentence in the case of all those who had <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> with him; namely, that they should abstain from the public congregations, but might perform <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> functions in private.  Moreover, he has the further liberty for the performance of his ministerial functions, from the fact that his sacred duties lie not at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, but at Iconium; for, as you have written to me yourself, he has chosen to live rather at the latter than at the former place. The man in question may, therefore, be received; but your reverence must require him to show repentance for the rash readiness of the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which he took before the unbeliever,  being unable to bear the trouble of that small peril.</p>

<p>XVIII. Concerning fallen <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who, after professing a chaste life before the Lord, make their vows vain, because they have fallen under the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of the flesh, our fathers, tenderly  and meekly making allowance for the infirmities of them that fall, laid down that they might be received after a year, ranking them with the digamists. Since, however, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> grows mightier as she advances, and the order of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> is becoming more numerous, it is my judgment that careful heed should be given both to the act as it appears upon consideration, and to the mind of Scripture, which may be discovered from the context. Widowhood is inferior to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>; consequently the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> comes far behind that of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Let us see what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes to Timothy. <q>The young <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they will marry; having damnation because they have cast off their first <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322696"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:11-12</a></span> If, therefore, a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> lies under a very heavy charge, as setting at naught her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, what must we think of the virgin, who is the bride of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and a chosen vessel dedicated to the Lord? It is a grave fault even on the part of a slave to give herself away in secret wedlock and fill the house with impurity, and, by her <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life, to wrong her owner; but it is forsooth far more shocking for the bride to become an adulteress, and, dishonouring her union with the bridegroom, to yield herself to unchaste indulgence. The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, as being a corrupted slave, is indeed condemned; but the virgin comes under the charge of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. We call the man who lives with another man's wife an adulterer, and do not receive him into communion until he has ceased from his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so we shall ordain in the case of him who has the virgin. One point, however, must be determined beforehand, that the name <em>virgin</em> is given to a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who voluntarily devotes herself to the Lord, renounces marriage, and embraces a life of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. And we admit professions dating from the age of full intelligence.  For it is not right in such cases to admit the words of mere children. But a girl of sixteen or seventeen years of age, in full possession of her faculties, who has been submitted to strict examination, and is then constant, and persists in her entreaty to be admitted, may then be ranked among the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, her profession ratified, and its violation rigorously punished. Many girls are brought forward by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and brothers, and other kinsfolk, before they are of full age, and have no inner impulse towards a celibate life. The object of the friends is simply to provide for themselves. Such <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> as these must not be readily received, before we have made public investigation of their own sentiments.</p>

<p>XIX. I do not recognise the profession of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, except in the case of those who have enrolled themselves in the order of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and seem to have secretly adopted the celibate life. Yet in their case I think it becoming that there should be a previous examination, and that a distinct profession should be received from them, so that whenever they may revert to the life of the pleasures of the flesh, they may be subjected to the punishment of fornicators.</p>

<p>XX. I do not think that any condemnation ought to be passed on <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who professed <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> while in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and then afterwards preferred marriage. <q>What things soever the law says, it says to them who are under the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322698"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse19">Romans&nbsp;3:19</a></span> Those who have not yet put on Christ's yoke do not recognise the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Lord. They are therefore to be received in the church, as having remission in the case of these <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> too, as of all, from their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As a general rule, all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> formerly committed in the catechumenical state are not taken into account.  The Church does not receive these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and it is very necessary that in such cases the birthrights should be observed.</p>

<p>XXI. If a man living with a wife is not satisfied with his marriage and falls into fornication, I account him a fornicator, and prolong his period of punishment. Nevertheless, we have no canon subjecting him to the charge of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be committed against an unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. For the adulteress, it is said, <q>being polluted shall be polluted,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322700"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse1">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:1</a></span> and she shall not return to her husband: and <q>He that keeps an adulteress is a fool and impious.</q>  He, however, who has committed fornication is not to be cut off from the society of his own wife. So the wife will receive the husband on his return from fornication, but the husband will expel the polluted <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from his house. The argument here is not easy, but the custom has so obtained. </p>

<p>XXII. Men who keep <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> carried off by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, if they carried them off when <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> to other men, must not be received before removal of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and their restoration to those to whom they were first contracted, whether they wish to receive them, or to separate from them. In the case of a girl who has been taken when not <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a>, she ought first to be removed, and restored to her own people, and handed over to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of her own people whether <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, or brothers, or any one having authority over her. If they choose to give her up, the cohabitation may stand; but, if they refuse, no <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> should be used. In the case of a man having a wife by seduction, be it secret or by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, he must be held guilty of fornication. The punishment of fornicators is fixed at four years. In the first year they must be expelled from <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and weep at the door of the church; in the second they may be received to sermon; in the third to penance; in the fourth to standing with the people, while they are withheld from the oblation. Finally, they may be admitted to the communion of the good gift.</p>

<p>XXIII. Concerning men who marry two sisters, or <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who marry two brothers a short letter of mine has been published, of which I have sent a copy to your reverence.  The man who has taken his own brother's wife is not to be received until he have separated from her.</p>

<p>XXIV. A <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> whose name is in the list of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, that is, who is supported  by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is ordered by the Apostle to be supported no longer when she marries. <span class="stiki" id="note322705"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:11-12</a></span> </p>

<p>There is no special rule for a widower. The punishment appointed for digamy may suffice. If a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who is sixty years of age chooses again to live with a husband, she shall be held unworthy of the communion of the good gift until she be moved no longer by her impure desire. If we reckon her before sixty years, the blame rests with us, and not with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</p>

<p>XXV. The man who retains as his wife the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom he has violated, shall be liable to the penalty of rape, but it shall be lawful for him to have her to wife.</p>

<p>XXVI. Fornication is not wedlock, nor yet the beginning of wedlock. Wherefore it is best, if possible, to put asunder those who are united in fornication. If they are set on cohabitation, let them admit the penalty of fornication. Let them be allowed to live together, lest a worse thing happen.</p>

<p>XXVII. As to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> involved in an illegal marriage,  I have made the fitting regulation, that he may hold his seat, but must abstain from other functions. For such a case pardon is enough. It is unreasonable that the man who has to treat his own wounds should be blessing another, for benediction is the imparting of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. How can he who through his fault, committed in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, is without <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, impart it to another? Let him bless neither in public nor in private, nor distribute the body of Christ to others, nor perform any other sacred function, but, content with his seat of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, let him beseech the Lord with weeping, that his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, committed in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, may be forgiven.</p>

<p>XXVIII. It has seemed to me ridiculous that any one should make a vow to abstain from swine's flesh. Be so good as to teach men to abstain from foolish vows and promises. Represent the use to be quite indifferent. No creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, received with thanksgiving, is to be rejected. <span class="stiki" id="note322707"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:4</a></span> The vow is ridiculous; the abstinence unnecessary.</p>

<p>XXIX. It is especially desirable that attention should be given to the case of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in power who threaten on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to do some hurt to those under their authority. The remedy is twofold. In the first place, let them be taught not to take oaths at random: secondly, not to persist in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> determinations. Any one who is arrested in the design of fulfilling an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> to injure another ought to show repentance for the rashness of his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and must not confirm his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> under the pretext of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> was none the better for fulfilling his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, when, of course only to save himself from <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, he became the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> murderer. <span class="stiki" id="note322708"><a href="../bible/mat014.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;14:10</a></span> Swearing is absolutely forbidden, <span class="stiki" id="note322709"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;5:34</a></span> and it is only reasonable that the <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> which tends to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should be condemned. The swearer must therefore change his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and not persist in confirming his impiety. Consider the absurdity of the thing a little further. Suppose a man to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> that he will put his brother's eyes out: is it well for him to carry his <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> into action? Or to commit <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>? Or to break any other commandment? <q>I have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, and I will perform it,</q>  not to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but to <q>keep your righteous judgments.</q> It is no less our duty to undo and destroy <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, than it is to confirm the commandment by immutable counsels.</p>

<p>XXX. As to those guilty of abduction we have no ancient rule, but I have expressed my own judgment. The period is three years;  the culprits and their accomplices to be excluded from service. The act committed without <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is not liable to punishment, whenever it has not been preceded by violation or <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is independent, and to follow or not is in her own power. We must, therefore, pay no heed to excuses.</p>

<p>XXXI. A <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whose husband has gone away and disappeared, and who marries another, before she has evidence of his death, commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Clerics who are guilty of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> unto death  are degraded from their order, but not excluded from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. You shall not punish twice for the same fault. </p>

<p>XXXIII. Let an indictment for <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> be preferred against the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who gives birth to a child on the road and pays no attention to it.</p>

<p>XXXIV. Women who had committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and confessed their fault through <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, or were in any way convicted, were not allowed by our fathers to be publicly exposed, that we might not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> their death after conviction. But they ordered that they should be excluded from communion till they had fulfilled their term of penance.</p>

<p>XXXV. In the case of a man deserted by his wife, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the desertion must be taken into account. If she appear to have abandoned him without reason, he is deserving of pardon, but the wife of punishment. Pardon will be given to him that he may communicate with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>XXXVI. Soldiers' wives who have married in their husbands' absence will come under the same principle as wives who, when their husbands have been on a journey, have not waited their return. Their case, however, does admit of some concession on the ground of there being greater reason to suspect death.</p>

<p>XXXVII. The man who marries after abducting another man's wife will incur the charge of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> for the first case; but for the second will go free.</p>

<p>XXXVIII. Girls who follow against their fathers' will commit fornication; but if their fathers are reconciled to them, the act seems to admit of a remedy. They are not however immediately restored to communion, but are to be punished for three years.</p>

<p>XXXIX. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who lives with an adulterer is an adulteress the whole time. </p>

<p>XL. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who yields to a man against her master's will commits fornication; but if afterwards she accepts free marriage, she marries. The former case is fornication; the latter marriage. The covenants of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are not independent have no validity.</p>

<p>XLI. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> in widowhood, who is independent, may dwell with a husband without blame, if there is no one to prevent their cohabitation; for the Apostle says; <q>but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322715"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:39</a></span> </p>

<p>XLII. Marriages contracted without the permission of those in authority, are fornication. If neither father nor master be living the contracting parties are free from blame; just as if the authorities assent to the cohabitation, it assumes the fixity of marriage.</p>

<p>XLIII. He who smites his neighbour to death is a murderer, whether he struck first or in self defence.</p>

<p>XLIV. The <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> who commits fornication with a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> may be received into repentance and will be admitted to the oblation in the seventh year; of course if she be living in <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> who, after he has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, takes to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, returns to his vomit. We do not, however, give up the body of the <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconess</a> to the use of the flesh, as being <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>.</p>

<p>XLV. If any one, after taking the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, insults <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he gets no good from the name.</p>

<p>XLVI. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who unwillingly marries a man deserted at the time by his wife, and is afterwards repudiated, because of the return of the former to him, commits fornication, but involuntarily. She will, therefore, not be prohibited from marriage; but it is better if she remain as she is. </p>

<p>XLVII. <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratit&aelig;</a>,  Saccophori,  and Apotactit&aelig;  are not regarded in the same manner as Novatians, since in their case a canon has been pronounced, although different; while of the former nothing has been said. All these I re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> on the same principle. If among you their re-<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is forbidden, for the sake of some arrangement, nevertheless let my principle prevail. Their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is, as it were, an offshoot of the Marcionites, abominating, as they do, marriage, refusing wine, and calling God's creature polluted. We do not therefore receive them into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, unless they be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Let them not say that they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, inasmuch as they make God the author of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, after the example of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Wherefore, if this be determined on, more <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> ought to meet together in one place and publish the canon in these terms, that action may be taken without peril, and authority given to answers to questions of this kind.</p>

<p>XLVIII. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has been abandoned by her husband, ought, in my judgment, to remain as she is. The Lord said, <q>If any one leave  his wife, saving for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fornication, he causes her to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322721"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> thus, by calling her adulteress, He excludes her from intercourse with another man. For how can the man being guilty, as having caused <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, go without blame, when she is called adulteress by the Lord for having intercourse with another man?</p>

<p>XLIX. Suffering violation should not be a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of condemnation. So the slave girl, if she has been forced by her own master, is free from blame.</p>

<p>L. There is no law as to trigamy: a third marriage is not contracted by law. We look upon such things as the defilements of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But we do not subject them to public condemnation, as being better than unrestrained fornication. </p>
