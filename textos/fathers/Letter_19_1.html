<h1>Letter 19</h1>

<p> <em>(For 347.) Coss. Rufinus, Eusebius; Pr&aelig;f. the same <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>; Indict. v; Easter-day, Prid. Id. Apr., Pharmuthi xvii; &AElig;ra Dioclet. 63; Moon 15.</em></p>

<p>'Blessed is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284439"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;1:3</a></span>,' for such an introduction is fitting for an Epistle, and more especially now, when it brings thanksgiving to the Lord, in the Apostle's words, because He has brought us from a distance, and granted us again to send openly to you, as usual, the Festal Letters. For this is the season of the feast, my brethren, and it is near; being not now proclaimed by trumpets, as the history records , but being made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and brought near to us by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, Who suffered on our behalf and rose again, even as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preached, saying, 'Our <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Passover</a>, Christ, is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>. ' Henceforth the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the Passover</a> is ours, not that of a stranger, nor is it any longer of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.  For the time of shadows is abolished, and those former things have ceased, and now the month of new things  is at hand, in which every man should keep the feast, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to Him who said, 'Observe the month of new things, and keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> to the Lord your God. ' Even the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> fancy they keep festival, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> hypo-critically feign to do so. But the feast of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> He reproves, as the bread <span class="stiki" id="note284445"><a href="../bible/hos009.htm#verse4">Hosea&nbsp;9:4</a></span> of mourners, and He turns His face from that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as being outcasts, saying, 'Your new moons and your sabbaths My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284446"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;1:14</a></span>.'</p>

<p>2. For actions not done lawfully and piously, are not of advantage, though they may be reputed to be so, but they rather argue hypocrisy in those who venture upon them. Therefore, although such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> feign to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, yet they hear from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, 'Your whole burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> do not please Me; and although you bring fine flour, it is vanity, <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> also is an abomination unto Me. ' For God does not need anything ; and, since nothing is unclean to Him, He is full in regard to them, as He testifies, by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, saying, 'I am full <span class="stiki" id="note284449"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse11">Isaiah&nbsp;1:11</a></span>.' Now there was a law given about these things, for the instruction of the people, and to prefigure things to come, for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says to the Galatians; 'Before <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> came, we were kept guarded under the law, being shut up in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which should afterwards be revealed unto us; wherefore the law was our instructor in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that we might be justified by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. ' But the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, neither did they understand, therefore they walked in the daytime as in darkness, feeling for, but not touching, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> we possess, which [was contained] in the law; conforming to the letter, but not submitting to the spirit. And when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> was veiled, they looked on him, but turned away their faces from him when he was uncovered. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what they read, but erroneously substituted one thing for another. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, therefore, cried against them, saying, 'Falsehood and faithlessness have prevailed among them.' The Lord also therefore said concerning them, 'The strange children have dealt <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> with Me; the strange children have waxen old. ' But how gently does He reprove them, saying, 'Had you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, you would have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Me, for he wrote of Me <span class="stiki" id="note284452"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse46">John&nbsp;5:46</a></span>.' But being faithless, they went on to deal <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> with the law, affirming things after their own pleasure, but not understanding the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>; and, further, as they had hypocritically made a pretence of the plain text of Scripture, and had confidence in this, He is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with them, saying by <a href="../cathen/08179b.htm">Isaiah</a>, 'Who has required these of your hands <span class="stiki" id="note284453"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;1:12</a></span>?' And by Jeremiah, since they were very bold, he threatens, 'Gather together your whole burnt-offerings with your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and eat flesh, for I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, concerning whole burnt-offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284454"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse21">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:21-22</a></span>.' For they did not act as was right, neither was their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> according to law, but they rather sought their own pleasure in such days, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> accuses them, beating down their bondsmen, and gathering themselves together for strifes and quarrels, and they smote the lowly with the fist, and did all things that tended to their own gratification. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, they continue without a feast until the end, although they make a display now of eating flesh, out of place and out of season. For, instead of the legally-appointed lamb, they have learned to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>; instead of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> unleavened bread, 'they collect the wood, and their fathers kindle the fire, and their wives prepare the dough, that they may make cakes to the <a href="../cathen/13286a.htm">host</a> of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, and pour out libations to strange gods, that they may provoke Me to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, says the Lord. ' They have the just reward of such devices, since, although they pretend to keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, yet <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> is taken from their mouth, as says Jeremiah, 'There has been taken away from the cities of Judah, and the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of those who are glad, and the voice of those who <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>; the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. ' Therefore now, 'he who among them <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> an ox, is as he who smites a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and he who <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> a lamb is as he who kills a dog, he that offers fine flour, is as [if he offered] swine's blood, he that gives frankincense for a memorial, is as a blasphemer <span class="stiki" id="note284457"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;66:3</a></span>.' Now these things will never please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, neither thus has the word required of them. But He says, 'These have chosen their own ways; and their abominations are what their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> delights in. '</p>

<p>3. And what does this mean my brethren? For it is right for us to investigate the saying of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and especially on account of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who have turned their mind against the law. By <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> then, God gave commandment respecting <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and all the book called Leviticus is entirely taken up with the arrangement of these matters, so that He might accept the offerer. So through the Prophets, He blames him who despised these things, as disobedient to the commandment  saying, 'I have not required these at your hands. Neither did I speak to your fathers respecting <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, nor command them concerning whole burnt-offerings. ' Now it is the opinion of some, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> do not agree together, or that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who gave the commandment, is false. But there is no disagreement whatever, far from it, neither can the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, lie; 'for it is impossible that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> should lie <span class="stiki" id="note284460"><a href="../bible/heb006.htm#verse18">Hebrews&nbsp;6:18</a></span>,' as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> affirms. But all these things are plain to those who rightly consider them, and to those who receive with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> the writings of the law. Now it appears to me&mdash; may God grant, by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that the remarks I presume to make may not be far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash; that not at first were the commandment and the law concerning <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, neither did the mind of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who gave the law, regard whole burnt-offerings, but those things which were pointed out and prefigured by them. 'For the law contained a shadow of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come.' And, 'Those things were appointed until the time of reformation. '</p>

<p>4. Therefore, the whole law did not treat of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, though there was in the law a commandment concerning <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, that by means of them it might begin to instruct men and might withdraw them from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and bring them near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, teaching them for that present time. Therefore neither at the beginning, when God brought the people out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, did He command them concerning <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> or whole burnt-offerings, nor even when they came to mount Sinai. For God is not as man, that He should be careful about these things beforehand; but His commandment was given, that they might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Him Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and His Word, and might despise those which are <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> called gods, which are not, but appear in outward show. So He made Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to them in that He brought them out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and caused them to pass through the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. But when they chose to serve <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>, and dared to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to those that have no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and forgot the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> which were wrought in their behalf in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and thought of returning there again; then indeed, after the law, that commandment concerning <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> was ordained as law; so that with their <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which at one time had meditated on those which are not, they might turn to Him Who is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and learn not, in the first place, to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, but to turn away their faces from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, and conform to what God commanded. For when He says, 'I have not spoken concerning <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, neither given commandment concerning whole burnt-offerings,' He immediately adds, 'But this is the thing which I commanded them, saying, Obey My voice, and I will be to you a <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you shall be to Me a people, and you shall walk in all the ways that I command you <span class="stiki" id="note284462"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse22">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:22-23</a></span>.' Thus then, being before instructed and taught, they learned not to do service to any one but the Lord. They attained to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what time the shadow should last, and not to forget the time that was at hand, in which no longer should the bullock of the herd be a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor the ram of the flock, nor the he-goat <span class="stiki" id="note284463"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;12:5</a></span>, but all these things should be fulfilled in a purely spiritual manner, and by constant <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and upright conversation, with godly words; as David sings, 'May my meditation be pleasing to Him. Let my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> be set forth before You as <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. ' The Spirit also, who is in him, commands, saying, 'Offer unto God the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, and pay to the Lord your vows. Offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of righteousness, and put your trust in the Lord. '</p>

<p>5. Samuel, that great man, no less clearly reproved Saul, saying, 'Is not the word better than a gift <span class="stiki" id="note284466"><a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse17">Sirach&nbsp;18:17</a></span>?' For hereby a man fulfils the law, and pleases <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as He says, 'The <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise shall glorify Me.' Let a man 'learn what this means, I will have mercy, and not <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> ,' and I will not condemn the adversaries. But this wearied them, for they were not anxious to understand, 'for had they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, they would not have crucified the Lord of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284468"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:8</a></span>.' And what their end is, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> foretold, crying, 'Woe unto their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, for they have devised an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought, saying, let us bind the just man, because he is not pleasing to us. ' The end of such abandonment as this can be nothing but <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as the Lord, when reproving them, says, 'You do <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284470"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;22:29</a></span>.' Afterwards when, being reproved, they should have come to their senses, they rather grew insolent, saying, 'We are <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>; and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God spoke to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284471"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;9:28-29</a></span>;' dealing the more <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> by that very expression, and accusing themselves. For had they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> him to whom they hearkened, they would not have denied the Lord, Who spoke by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when He was present. Not so did the eunuch in the Acts, for when he heard, 'Do you understand what you read?' <span class="stiki" id="note284472"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse30">Acts&nbsp;8:30</a></span> he was not ashamed to confess his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, and implored to be taught. Therefore, to him who became a learner, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit was given. But as for those <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who persisted in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; as the proverb says, 'Death came upon them. For the fool dies in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. '</p>

<p>6. Like these too, are the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who, having fallen from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> discernment, dare to invent to themselves <a href="../cathen/02040a.htm">atheism</a>. 'For the fool says in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, and become abominable in their doings. ' Of such as are fools in their thoughts, the actions are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, as He says, 'can you, being <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, speak <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things <span class="stiki" id="note284475"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;12:34</a></span>;' for they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because they thought <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Or how can those do just acts, whose minds are set upon fraud? Or how shall he <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, who is prepared beforehand to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>? How shall he be merciful, who is bent upon the <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a>? How shall he be chaste, who looks upon a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her? 'For from the heart proceed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts, fornications, adulteries, murders. ' By them the fool is wrecked, as by the waves of the sea, being led away and enticed by his fleshly pleasures; for this stands written, 'All flesh of fools is greatly tempest-tossed. ' While he associates with folly, he is tossed by a tempest, and perishes, as Solomon says in the Proverbs, 'The fool and he who lacks understanding shall perish together, and shall leave their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> to strangers. ' Now they suffer such things, because there is not among them one sound of mind to guide them. For where there is sagacity, there the Word, who is the Pilot of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, is with the vessel; 'for he that has understanding shall possess guidance ;' but they who are without guidance fall like the leaves. Who has so completely fallen away as Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus, who held <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> opinions respecting the resurrection, and concerning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in it suffered shipwreck? And Judas being a traitor, fell away from the Pilot, and perished with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.  But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> since they were wise, and therefore remained with the Lord, although the sea was agitated, and the ship covered with the waves, for there was a storm, and the wind was contrary, yet fell not away. For they awoke the Word, Who was sailing with them , and immediately the sea became smooth at the command of its Lord, and they were saved. They became preachers and teachers at the same time; relating the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, and teaching us also to imitate their example. These things were written on our account and for our profit, so that through these signs we may acknowledge the Lord Who wrought them.</p>

<p>7. Let us, therefore, in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, hold frequent converse with our Master. For the world is like the sea to us, my brethren, of which it is written, 'This is the great and wide sea, there go the ships; the Leviathan, which You have created to play therein. ' We float on this sea, as with the wind, through our own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, for every one directs his course according to his will, and either, under the pilotage of the Word, he enters into rest, or, laid hold on by pleasure, he suffers shipwreck, and is in peril by storm. For as in the ocean there are storms and waves, so in the world there are many afflictions and trials. The unbelieving therefore 'when affliction or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> arises is offended <span class="stiki" id="note284483"><a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse17">Mark&nbsp;4:17</a></span>,' as the Lord said. For not being confirmed in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and having his regard towards temporal things, he cannot resist the difficulties which arise from afflictions. But like that house, built on the sand by the foolish man, so he, being without understanding <span class="stiki" id="note284484"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;6:49</a></span>, falls before the assault of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>, as it were by the winds. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, having their senses exercised in self-possession <span class="stiki" id="note284485"><a href="../bible/heb005.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;5:14</a></span>, and being strong in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and understanding the word, do not faint under trials; but although, from time to time, circumstances of greater trial are set against them, yet they continue faithful, and awaking the Lord Who is with them, they are delivered. So, passing through water and fire, they find relief and duly keep the feast, offering up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> with thanksgiving to God Who has redeemed them. For either being tempted they are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, like <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, or suffering they are approved, like Job, or being oppressed and deceitfully treated, like Joseph, they patiently endure it, or being <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>, they are not overtaken; but as it is written, through God they 'leap over the wall ' of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, which divides and separates between brethren, and turns them from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. In this manner the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, when he took pleasure in infirmities, in reproach, in necessities, in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, and in distresses for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, rejoiced, and wished all of us to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> saying, 'Rejoice always; in everything give thanks <span class="stiki" id="note284487"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:18</a></span>.'</p>

<p>8. For what is so fitting for the feast, a turning from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and a pure conversation, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> offered without ceasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with thanksgiving? Therefore let us, my brethren, looking forward to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven, keep the feast here also, rejoicing at all times, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> incessantly, and in everything giving thanks to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. I give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for those other wonders He has done, and for the various helps that have now been granted us, in that though He has chastened us sore, He did not deliver us over to death, but brought us from a distance even as from the ends of the earth, and has united us again with you. I have been mindful while I keep the feast, to give you also notice of the great feast of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, that so we may go up together, as it were, to Jerusalem, and eat the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, not separately but as in one house ; let us not as sodden in water, water down the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; neither let us, as having broken its bones, destroy the commands of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. But as roasted with fire, with bitterness, being fervent in spirit, in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and watchings, with lying on the ground, let us keep it with penitence and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>9. We begin the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">fast of forty days</a> on the sixth day of Phamenoth <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar002.htm">Mark 2</a></span>; and having passed through that properly, with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, we may be able to attain to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day. For he who neglects to observe the <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">fast of forty days</a>, as one who rashly and impurely treads on <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, cannot celebrate the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> festival. Further, let us put one another in remembrance, and stimulate one another not to be negligent, and especially that we should fast those days, so that <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> may receive us in succession, and we may rightly bring the feast to a close.</p>

<p>10. The <a href="../cathen/09152a.htm">fast of forty days</a> begins then, as was already said, on the sixth of Phamenoth (March 2), and the great week of the Passion on the eleventh of Pharmuthi (April 6). And let us rest from the fast on the sixteenth of it (April 11), on the seventh day, late in the evening. Let us keep the feast when the first of the week dawns upon us, on the seventeenth of the same month Pharmuthi (Apr. 12). Let us then add, one after the other, the seven <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> weeks of Pentecost, rejoicing and praising <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that He has by these things made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us beforehand, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and rest everlasting, prepared in heaven for us and for those who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>; through Whom, and with Whom, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. The brethren who are with me salute you.</p>

<p> I have also thought it necessary to inform you of the appointment of Bishops, which has taken place in the stead of our blessed fellow-ministers, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to whom to write, and from whom you should receive letters. In Syene, therefore, Nilammon, instead of Nilammon of the same name. In Latopolis, Masis, instead of Ammonius. In Coptos, Psenosiris , instead of Theodorus.  In Panopolis, because Artemidorus  desired it, on account of his old age, and weakness of body, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> is appointed coadjutor. In Hypsele, Arsenius, having become reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In Lycopolis, Eud&aelig;mon  in the stead of Plusianus.  In Antino&ouml;polis, Arion , instead of Ammonius and Tyrannus.  In Oxyrynchus, Theodorus, instead of Pelagius. In Nilopolis, instead of Theon, Amatus , and Isaac, who are reconciled to each other. In Arsenoitis, Andreas , instead of Silvanus.  In Prosopitis, Triadelphus, instead of Serapammon.  In Diosphacus, on the river side, Theodorus, instead of Serapammon. In Sais, Paphnutius, instead of Nemesion. In Xois, Theodorus, instead of Anubion; and there is also with him Isidorus, who is reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. In Sethroitis, Orion , instead of Potammon.  In Clysma, Tithonas , instead of Jacob; and there is with him Paulus, who has been reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
