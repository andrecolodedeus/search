<p><strong>Of Fasting, and Trumpets, and Feasts.</strong></p>

<p>Come, my beloved, the season calls us to keep the feast. Again, 'the Sun of Righteousness <span class="stiki" id="note283884"><a href="../bible/mal004.htm#verse2">Malachi&nbsp;4:2</a></span>, causing His divine beams to rise upon us, proclaims beforehand the time of the feast, in which, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> Him, we ought to celebrate it, lest when the time has passed by, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> likewise may pass us by. For discerning the time is one of the duties most urgent on us, for the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; so that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, when instructing his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, teaches him to observe the time, saying, 'Stand (ready) in season, and out of season '&mdash; that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> both the one and the other, he might do things befitting the season, and avoid the blame of unseasonableness. For thus the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, after the manner of wise Solomon , distributes everything in time and season, to the end that, in due time, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of men should be everywhere spread abroad. Thus the 'Wisdom of God <span class="stiki" id="note283887"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span>,' <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, not out of season, but in season, 'passed upon <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, fashioning the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283888"><a href="../bible/wis007.htm#verse27">Wisdom&nbsp;7:27</a></span>;' so that although very many were <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for Him, and saying, 'O that the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of God had come out of Sion! '&mdash; the Spouse also, as it is written in the Song of Songs, was <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> and saying, 'O that You were my sister's son, that sucked the breasts of my mother <span class="stiki" id="note283890"><a href="../bible/son008.htm#verse1">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;8:1</a></span>!' that You were like the children of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and wouldest take upon You <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> for our sake!&mdash; nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, the Maker of times and seasons, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> our affairs better than we do, while, as a good physician, He exhorts to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> in season&mdash; the only one in which we may be healed&mdash; so also does He send Him not unseasonably, but seasonably, saying, 'In an acceptable time have I heard You, and in the day of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> I have helped You <span class="stiki" id="note283891"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse8">Isaiah&nbsp;49:8</a></span>.'</p>

<p>2. And, on this account, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, urging us to note this season, wrote, saying, 'Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283892"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:2</a></span>.' At set seasons also He called the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> to the Levitical feasts by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying, 'Three times in a year you shall keep a feast to Me <span class="stiki" id="note283893"><a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse14">Exodus&nbsp;23:14</a></span> ' (one of which, my beloved, is that now at hand), the trumpets of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> sounding and urging its observance; as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Psalmist commanded, saying, 'Blow with the trumpet in the new moon, on the [solemn] day of your feast. ' Since this sentence enjoins upon us to blow both on the new moons, and on the solemn  days, He has made a solemn day of that in which the light of the moon is perfected in the full; which was then a type, as is this of the trumpets. At one time, as has been said, they called to the feasts; at another time to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. And this was not done without <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, nor by chance, but this sound of the trumpets was appointed, so that every man should come to that which was proclaimed. And this ought to be learned not merely from me, but from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, when God was revealed to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and said, as it is written in the book of Numbers; 'And the Lord spoke unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying, Make to you two trumpets; of silver shall you make them, and they shall be for you to call the congregation <span class="stiki" id="note283896"><a href="../bible/num010.htm#verse1">Numbers&nbsp;10:1-2</a></span>;'&mdash; very properly for those who here <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him. So that we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these things had reference to the time of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>&mdash; yea, were to be observed so long as the shadow lasted, the whole being appointed for use, 'till the time of reformation <span class="stiki" id="note283897"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse10">Hebrews&nbsp;9:10</a></span>.' 'For' (said He) 'if you shall go out to battle in your land against your enemies that rise up against you <span class="stiki" id="note283898"><a href="../bible/num010.htm#verse9">Numbers&nbsp;10:9</a></span> ' (for such things as these refer to the land, and no further), 'then you shall proclaim with the trumpets, and shall be remembered before the Lord, and be delivered from your enemies.' Not only in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> did they blow the trumpet, but under the law, there was a festal trumpet also. Hear him again, going on to say, 'And in the day of your <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, and in your feasts, and your new moons, you shall blow with the trumpets. ' And let no man think it a light and contemptible matter, if he hear the law command respecting trumpets; it is a wonderful and fearful thing. For beyond any other voice or instrument, the trumpet is awakening and terrible; so <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> received instruction by these means, because he was then but a child. But in order that the proclamation should not be thought merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, being superhuman, its sounds resembled those which were uttered when they trembled before the mount <span class="stiki" id="note283900"><a href="../bible/exo019.htm#verse16">Exodus&nbsp;19:16</a></span>; and they were reminded of the law that was then given them, and kept it.</p>

<p>3. For the law was admirable, and the shadow was excellent, otherwise, it would not have wrought <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and induced reverence in those who heard; especially in those who at that time not only heard but saw these things. Now these things were typical, and done as in a shadow. But let us pass on to the meaning, and henceforth leaving the figure at a distance, come to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and look upon the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> trumpets of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, which cry out, and call us, at one time to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> says; 'We wrestle not with flesh and blood, but with principalities, with powers, with the rulers of this dark world, with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> spirits in heaven <span class="stiki" id="note283901"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span>.' At another time the call is made to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and self-denial, and conjugal harmony, saying, To <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, the things of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>; and to those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the way of abstinence, the things of abstinence; and to those who are married , the things of an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> marriage; thus assigning to each its own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> recompense. Sometimes the call is made to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and sometimes to a feast. Hear again the same [Apostle] blowing the trumpet, and proclaiming, 'Christ our <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Passover</a> is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>; therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. ' If you would listen to a trumpet much greater than all these, hear our Saviour saying; 'In that last and great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink <span class="stiki" id="note283904"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37</a></span>.' For it became the Saviour not simply to call us to a feast, but to 'the great feast.' if only we will be prepared to hear, and to conform to the proclamation of every trumpet.</p>

<p>4. For since, as I before said, there are various proclamations, listen, as in a figure, to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> blowing the trumpet; and further, having turned to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, be ready for the announcement of the trumpet, for he says, 'Blow the trumpet in Sion: sanctify a fast <span class="stiki" id="note283905"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse15">Joel&nbsp;2:15</a></span>.' This is a warning trumpet, and commands with great earnestness, that when we fast, we should hallow the fast. For not all those who call upon <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, hallow <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since there are some who defile Him; yet not Him&mdash; that is impossible&mdash; but their own mind concerning Him; for He is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and has pleasure in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.  And therefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> accuses those who dishonour <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; 'Transgressors of the law dishonour God <span class="stiki" id="note283907"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;2:23</a></span>.' So then, to make a separation from those who pollute the fast, he says here, 'sanctify a fast.' For many, crowding to the fast, pollute themselves in the thoughts of their hearts, sometimes by doing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against their brethren, sometimes by daring to defraud. And, to mention nothing else, there are many who exalt themselves above their neighbours, thereby causing great mischief. For the boast of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> did no good to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, although he fasted twice in the week <span class="stiki" id="note283908"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;18:12</a></span>, only because he exalted himself against the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>. In the same manner the Word blamed the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> on account of such a fast as this, exhorting them by Isaiah the Prophet, and saying, 'This is not the fast and the day that I have chosen, that a man should <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; not even if you should bow down your neck like a hook, and should spread sackcloth and ashes under you; neither thus shall you call the fast acceptable <span class="stiki" id="note283909"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;58:5</a></span>.' That we may be able to show what kind of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> we should be when we fast, and of what character the fast should be, listen again to God commanding <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and saying, as it is written in Leviticus , 'And the Lord spoke unto <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, saying, In the tenth day of this seventh month, there shall be a day of atonement; a convocation, and a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day shall it be to you; and you shall <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and offer whole burnt-offerings unto the Lord.' And afterwards, that the law might be defined on this point, He proceeds to say; 'Every <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that shall not <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> itself, shall be cut off from the people. '</p>

<p>5. Behold, my brethren, how much a fast can do, and in what manner the law commands us to fast. It is required that not only with the body should we fast, but with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is humbled when it does not follow <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> opinions, but feeds on becoming <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. For <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> are the food of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and it can eat either of these two meats, and incline to either of the two, according to its own will. If it is bent toward <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it will be nourished by <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, by righteousness, by <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>, by meekness, by <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says; 'Being nourished by the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283912"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:6</a></span>.' Such was the case with our Lord, who said, 'My meat is to do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of My Father which is in heaven <span class="stiki" id="note283913"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;4:34</a></span>.' But if it is not thus with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and it inclines downwards, it is then nourished by nothing but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For thus the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, describing sinners and their food, referred to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> when He said, 'I have given him to be meat to the people of &AElig;thiopia. ' For this is the food of sinners. And as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, being heavenly bread, is the food of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, according to this; 'Unless you eat My flesh, and drink My blood <span class="stiki" id="note283915"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse53">John&nbsp;6:53</a></span>;' so is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the food of the impure, and of those who do nothing which is of the light, but work the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of darkness. Therefore, in order to withdraw and turn them from <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, He commands them to be nourished with the food of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; namely, humbleness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, lowliness to endure humiliations, the acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For not only does such a fast as this obtain pardon for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but being kept <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, it prepares the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and raises them above the earth.</p>

<p>6. And indeed that which I am about to say is wonderful, yea it is of those things which are very miraculous; yet not far from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as you may be able to learn from the sacred  writings. That great man <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, conversed with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and received the law. The great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Elijah, when <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, was thought worthy of <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">divine visions</a>, and at last was taken up like Him who ascended into heaven. And Daniel, when <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, although a very young man, was entrusted with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, and he alone understood the secret things of the king, and was thought worthy of <a href="../cathen/15477a.htm">divine visions</a>. But because the length of the fast of these men was wonderful, and the days prolonged, let no man lightly fall into unbelief; but rather let him <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the word which is from Him, suffice to nourish those who hear, and stand to them in place of all food. For the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> are no otherwise sustained than by <a href="../cathen/02364a.htm">beholding at all times the face of the Father</a>, and of the Saviour who is in heaven. And thus <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, as long as he talked with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fasted indeed bodily, but was nourished by divine words. When he descended among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and God had gone up from him, he suffered hunger like other men. For it is not said that he fasted longer than forty days&mdash; those in which he was conversing with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, generally, each one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> has been thought worthy of similar transcendent nourishment.</p>

<p>7. Wherefore, my beloved, having our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> nourished with divine food, with the Word, and according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> bodily in things external, let us keep this great and saving feast as becomes us. Even the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> received this divine food, through the type, when they ate a lamb in the passover. But not understanding the type, even to this day they eat the lamb, erring in that they are without the city and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. As long as Jud&aelig;a and the city <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, there were a type, and a lamb, and a shadow, since the law thus commanded : These things shall not be done in another city; but in the land of Jud&aelig;a, and in no place without [the land of Jud&aelig;a]. And besides this, the law commanded them to offer whole burnt-offerings and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, there being no other altar than that in Jerusalem. For on this account, in that city alone was there an altar and temple built, and in no other city were they permitted to perform these <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>, so that when that city should come to an end, then those things that were figurative might also be done away.</p>

<p>8. Now observe; that city, since the coming of our Savior, has had an end, and all the land of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> has been laid waste; so that from the testimony of these things (and we need no further <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, being assured by our own eyes of the fact) there must, of necessity, be an end of the shadow. And not from me should these things be learned, but the sacred voice of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> foretold, crying; 'Behold upon the mountains the feet of Him that brings good tidings, and publishes peace <span class="stiki" id="note283918"><a href="../bible/nah001.htm#verse15">Nahum&nbsp;1:15</a></span>;' and what is the message he published, but that which he goes on to say to them, 'Keep your feasts, O Judah; pay to the Lord your vows. For they shall no more go to that which is old; it is finished; it is taken away: He is gone up who breathed upon the face, and delivered you from affliction. ' Now who is he that went up? A man may say to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, in order that even the boast of the shadow may be done away; neither is it an idle thing to listen to the expression, 'It is finished; he is gone up who breathed.' For nothing was finished before he went up who breathed. But as soon as he went up, it was finished. Who was he then, O <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, as I said before? If <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, the assertion would be false; for the people were not yet come to the land in which alone they were commanded to perform these <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>. But if Samuel, or any other of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, even in that case there would be a perversion of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for hitherto these things were done in Jud&aelig;a, and the city was standing. For it was necessary that while that stood, these things should be performed. So that it was none of these, my beloved, who went up. But if you would hear the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> matter, and be kept from Jewish fables, behold our Saviour who went up, and 'breathed upon the face, and said to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283920"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse22">John&nbsp;20:22</a></span>.' For as soon as these things were done, everything was finished, for the altar was broken, and the veil of the temple was rent; and although the city was not yet laid waste, the abomination was ready to sit in the midst of the temple, and the city and those ancient ordinances to receive their final consummation.</p>

<p>9. Since then we have passed beyond that time of shadows, and no longer perform <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> under it, but have turned, as it were, unto the Lord; 'for the Lord is the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and where the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> is, there is liberty <span class="stiki" id="note283921"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span>;'&mdash; as we hear the sacred trumpet, no longer slaying a material lamb, but that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Lamb that was slain, even <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>; 'Who was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and was dumb as a lamb before her shearers <span class="stiki" id="note283922"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span>;' being purified by His precious blood, which speaks better things than that of Abel, having our feet shod with the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, holding in our hands the rod and staff of the Lord, by which that saint was comforted, who said , 'Your rod and Your staff they comfort me;' and to sum up, being in all respects prepared, and careful for nothing, because, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> says, 'The Lord is at hand <span class="stiki" id="note283924"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse5">Philippians&nbsp;4:5</a></span>;' and as our Saviour says, 'In an hour when we think not, the Lord comes&mdash;Let us keep the Feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Putting off the old man and his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, let us put on the new man , which is created in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,' in humbleness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; in meditation of the law by night and by day. And casting away all hypocrisy and fraud, putting far from us all <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and deceit, let us take upon us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards God and towards our neighbour, that being new [creatures], and receiving the new wine, even the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, we may properly keep the feast, even the month of these new [fruits]. </p>

<p>10. We  begin the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fast on the fifth day of Pharmuthi (March 31), and adding to it according to the number of those six <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and great days, which are the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the creation of this world, let us rest and cease (from <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>) on the tenth day of the same Pharmuthi (April 5), on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">sabbath</a> of the week. And when the first day of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> week dawns and rises upon us, on the eleventh day of the same month (April 6), from which again we count all the seven weeks one by one, let us keep feast on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day of Pentecost&mdash; on that which was at one time to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, typically, the feast of weeks, in which they granted forgiveness and settlement of debts; and indeed that day was one of deliverance in every respect. Let us keep the feast on the first day of the great week, as a <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the world to come, in which we here receive a pledge that we shall have everlasting life hereafter. Then having passed hence, we shall keep a perfect feast with Christ, while we cry out and say, like the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, 'I will pass to the place of the wondrous tabernacle, to the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; with the voice of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> and thanksgiving, the shouting of those who <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> ;' whence pain and sorrow and sighing have fled, and upon our heads <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> shall have come to us! May we be judged worthy to be partakers in these things.</p>

<p>11. Let us remember the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and not forget kindness to strangers; above all, let us <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God with all our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and might, and strength, and our neighbour as ourselves. So may we receive those things which the eye has not seen, nor the ear heard, and which have not entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has prepared for those that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him , through His only Son, our Lord and Saviour, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>; through Whom, to the Father alone, by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. All the brethren who are with me salute you.</p>
