<h1>Letter 1</h1>

<p> <em>To the Bishop of Aquileia.</em></p>

<h2>I. Through the negligence of the authorities the Pelagian heresy has been spreading in his province.</h2>

<p>From the account of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Septimus which is contained in the subjoined letter , we have understood that certain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of various orders  in your province who have been drawn in by the Pelagian or C&aelig;lestian <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, have attained to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion without any recantation of their peculiar <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> being required of them; and that, while the shepherds set to watch were fast asleep, wolves clothed in sheep-skins but without laying aside their bestial minds have entered into the Lord's sheep-fold: and that they make a practice of what is not allowed even to non-offenders by the injunctions of our canons and decrees : to wit that they should leave the churches in which they received or regained their office and carry their uncertainty in all directions, loving to continue wandering and never to remain on the foundations of the Apostles. For without being sifted by any test or bound by any previous confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they make a great point of their right to the privilege of going to one house after another under cover of their being in communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and corrupting the hearts of many through men's <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>  of their false name. And yet I am sure they could not do this, if the rulers of the churches had exercised their rightful diligence in the matter of receiving such, and had not allowed any of them to wander from place to place.</p>

<h2>II. He orders a provincial synod to be convened to receive the recantation of the heretics in express terms.</h2>

<p>Accordingly, lest this should be attempted any further, and lest this pernicious habit, which owes its introduction to certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons'</a> negligence, should result in the overthrow of many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, by this our authoritative injunction we charge you, brother, to give diligence that a synod of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>  of your province be convened, and all, whether <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clerics</a> of any rank who have been re-admitted from their alliance with the <a href="../cathen/11604a.htm">Pelagians</a> and the C&aelig;lestians into <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion with such precipitation that they were not first constrained to recant their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, be now at least forced to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> correction, which can advantage themselves and hurt no one, since their deceitfulness has in part been disclosed. Let them by their public confession condemn the authors of this presumptuous  <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and renounce all that the universal Church has repudiated in their doctrine: and let them announce by full and open statements, signed by their own hand, that they embrace and entirely approve of all the synodal decrees which the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> has ratified to the rooting out of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Let nothing obscure, nothing ambiguous be found in their words. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that their cunning is such that they reckon that the meaning of any particular clause of their execrable doctrine can be defended if they only keep it distinct from the main body of their damnable views. </p>

<h2> 3. The Pelagian view of God's grace is unscriptural.</h2>

<p>And when they pretend to disapprove of and give up all their definitions to facilitate evasion through their complete art of deception, unless their meaning is detected, they make exception of the dogma that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God is given according to the merits of the recipient. And yet surely, unless it is given freely, it is not a gift , but a price and compensation for merits: for the blessed Apostle says, <q>by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you have been saved through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that not of yourselves but it is the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not of works lest any should perchance be exalted. For we are His workmanship created in Christ Jesus in good works, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> prepared that we should walk in them <span class="stiki" id="note360024"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;2:8-10</a></span> .</q> Thus every bestowal of good works is of God's preparing: because a man is justified by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> rather than by his own excellence: for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is to every one the source of righteousness, the source of good and the fountain of merit. But these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> say it is anticipated by men's natural goodness for this reason, that that nature which (in their view) is before <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> conspicuous for good desires of its own, may not seem marred by any stain of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that what the Truth says may be falsified: <q>For the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> came to seek and to save that which was lost. </q></p>

<h2>IV. Prompt measures are essential.</h2>

<p>You must take heed, therefore, beloved, and with great diligence make provision that offenses which have long been removed be not set up again through such men and that no seed of the same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spring up in your province from a doctrine which has once been uprooted: for not only will it take root and grow, but also will taint the future generations of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with its poisonous exhalations. Those who wish to appear corrected must purge themselves of all suspicion: and by <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> us, prove themselves ours. And if any of them decline to satisfy our wholesome injunctions, be he <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a> or <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, he must be driven from the society of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> lest he deal treacherously by others' safety as well as forfeit his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<h2>V. The canons must be enforced against clerics who wander from one church to another.</h2>

<p>We admonish you also to restore to full working that part of the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whereby the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers and we have often in former times decreed that neither in the grade of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> nor in the order of the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> nor in the lower ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, is any one at liberty to migrate from church to church: to the end that each one may persevere where he was ordained without being enticed by ambition, or led astray by greed, or corrupted by men's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beliefs: and thus that if any one, seeking his own interests, not those of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> , neglect to return to his own people  and church, he may be reckoned out of the pale both in respect of promotion and of the bond of communion. But do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, beloved, that we must be somewhat sorely moved if, as we think not, our decrees for the maintenance of the canons and the integrity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be neglected: because the short-comings of the lower orders  are to be laid at the door of none so much as of those <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> and remiss rulers who often foster much pestilence by shrinking from the application of a stringent remedy.</p>
