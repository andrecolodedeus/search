<h1>Letter 203 (A.D. 420)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Noble Lord and Most Excellent and Loving Son, Largus, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>I received the letter of your Excellency, in which you ask me to write to you. This assuredly you would not have done unless you had esteemed acceptable and pleasant that which you suppose me capable of writing to you. In other words, I assume that, having desired the vanities of this life when you had not tried them, now, after the trial has been made, you despise them, because in them the pleasure is deceitful, the labour fruitless, the anxiety perpetual, the elevation dangerous. Men seek them at first through imprudence, and give them up at last with disappointment and remorse. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> of all the things which, in the cares of this mortal life, are <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> with more eagerness than wisdom by the uneasy solicitude of the men of the world. But it is wholly otherwise with the hope of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>: very different is the fruit of their labours, very different the reward of their dangers. Fear and grief, and labour and danger are unavoidable, so long as we live in this world; but the great question is, for what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, with what expectation, with what aim a man endures these things. When, indeed, I contemplate the lovers of this world, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not at what time wisdom can most opportunely attempt their moral improvement; for when they have apparent prosperity, they reject disdainfully her salutary admonitions, and regard them as old wives fables; when, again, they are in adversity, they think rather of escaping merely from present suffering than of obtaining the real remedy by which they may be made whole, and may arrive at that place where they shall be altogether exempt from suffering. Occasionally, however, some open their ears and hearts to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;rarely in prosperity, more frequently in adversity. These are indeed the few, for such it is predicted that they shall be. Among these I desire you to be, because I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, my noble lord and most excellent and loving son. Let this counsel be my answer to your letter, because though I am unwilling that you should henceforth suffer such things as you have endured, yet I would grieve still more if you were found to have suffered these things without any change for the better in your life.</p>
