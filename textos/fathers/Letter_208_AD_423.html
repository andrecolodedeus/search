<h1>Letter 208 (A.D. 423)</h1>

<p> <em>To the Lady Felicia, His Daughter in the Faith, and Worthy of Honour Among the Members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, when I consider both your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the weakness or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of others, that your mind has been disturbed, for even a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle, full of compassionate <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, confesses a similiar experience, saying, <q>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112894"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> Wherefore, as I myself share your pain, and am solicitous for your welfare in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I have thought it my duty to address this letter, partly consolatory, partly hortatory, to your Holiness, because in the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, in which all His members are one, you are very closely related to us, being loved as an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> member in that body, and partaking with us of life in His <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</p>

<p>2. I exhort you, therefore, not to be too much troubled by those offenses which for this very reason were foretold as destined to come, that when they came we might remember that they had been foretold, and not be greatly disconcerted by them. For the Lord Himself in His gospel foretold them, saying, <q>Woe unto the world because of offenses! For it must needs be that offenses come; but woe unto that man by whom the offense comes!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112895"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;18:7</a></span> These are the men of whom the apostle said, <q>They seek their own, not the things that are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112896"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;2:21</a></span> There are, therefore, some who hold the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> office of shepherds in order that they may provide for the flock of Christ; others occupy that position that they may enjoy the temporal honours and secular advantages connected with the office. It must needs happen that these two kinds of pastors, some dying, others succeeding them, should continue in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even to the end of time, and the judgment of the Lord. If, then, in the times of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> there were men such that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, grieved by their conduct, enumerates among his trials, <q>perils among false brethren,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112897"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:26</a></span> and yet he did not haughtily cast them out, but patiently bore with them, how much more must such arise in our times, since the Lord most plainly says concerning this age which is drawing to a close, <q>that because iniquity shall abound the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many shall wax cold.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112898"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12-13</a></span> The word which follows, however, ought to console and exhort us, for He adds, <q>He that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.</q></p>

<p>3. Moreover, as there are good shepherds and bad shepherds, so also in flocks there are good and bad. The good are represented by the name of sheep, but the bad are called goats: they feed, nevertheless, side by side in the same pastures, until the Chief Shepherd, who is called the One Shepherd, shall come and separate them one from another according to His promise, <q>as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats.</q> On us He has laid the duty of gathering the flock; to Himself He has reserved the work of final separation, because it pertains properly to Him who cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>. For those presumptuous servants, who have lightly ventured to separate before the time which the Lord has reserved in His own hand, have, instead of separating others, only been separated themselves from <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity; for how could those have a clean flock who have by <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> become unclean?</p>

<p>4. In order, therefore, that we may remain in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and not, stumbling at the offenses occasioned by the chaff, desert the threshing-floor of the Lord, but rather remain as wheat till the final winnowing, <span class="stiki" id="note112899"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;3:12</a></span> and by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which imparts stability to us bear with the beaten straw, our great Shepherd in the gospel admonishes us concerning the good shepherds, that we should not, on account of their good works, place our hope in them, but glorify our heavenly Father for making them such; and concerning the bad shepherds (whom He designed to point out under the name of <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>), He reminds us that they teach that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> though they do that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note112900"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;3:12</a></span> </p>

<p>5. Concerning the good shepherds He thus speaks: <q>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</q>  Concerning the bad shepherds He admonishes the sheep in these words: <q>The <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> sit in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> seat: all, therefore, whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112902"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;23:2-3</a></span> When these are listened to, the sheep of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> teachers, hear His voice, and do not forsake the unity of His flock, because the good which they hear them teach belongs not to the shepherds but to Him, and therefore the sheep are safely fed, since even under bad shepherds they are nourished in the Lord's pastures. They do not, however, imitate the actions of the bad shepherds, because such actions belong not to the world but to the shepherds themselves. In regard, however, to those whom they see to be good shepherds, they not only hear the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which they teach, but also imitate the good actions which they perform. Of this number was the apostle, who said: <q>Be followers of me, even as I also am of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112903"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:1</a></span> He was a light kindled by the Eternal Light, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself, and was placed on a candlestick because He gloried in His cross, concerning which he said: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that I should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, save in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112904"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> Moreover, since he sought not his own things, but the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s, while he exhorts to the imitation of his own life those whom he had <q>begotten through the gospel,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112905"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:15</a></span> he yet severely reproved those who, by the names of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, introduced schisms, and he chides those who said, <q>I am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> crucified for you? Or were ye <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112906"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:12-13</a></span> </p>

<p>6. Hence we understand both that the good shepherds are those who seek not their own, but the things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and that the good sheep, though imitating the works of the good shepherds by whose ministry they have been gathered together, do not place their hope in them, but rather in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, by Whose blood they are redeemed; so that when they may happen to be placed under bad shepherds, preaching Christ's doctrine and doing their own <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works, they will do what they teach, but will not do what they do, and will not, on account of these sons of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, forsake the pastures of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church. For there are both good and bad in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which, unlike the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, is extended and spread abroad, not in Africa only, but through all nations; as the apostle expresses it, <q>bringing forth fruit, and increasing in the whole world.</q>  But those who are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as long as they are opposed to it cannot be good; although an apparently praiseworthy conversation seems to prove some of them to be good, their separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself renders them bad, according to the saying of the Lord: <q>He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112908"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> </p>

<p>7. Therefore, my daughter, worthy of all welcome and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> among the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I exhort you to hold faithfully that which the Lord has committed to you, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with all your heart Him and His Church who suffered you not, by joining yourself with the lost, to lose the recompense of your <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, or perish with them. For if you should depart out of this world separated from the unity of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it will avail you nothing to have preserved inviolate your <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is rich in mercy, has done in regard to you that which is written in the gospel: when the invited guests excused themselves to the master of the feast, he said to the servants, <q>Go, therefore, into the highways and hedges, and as many as you shall find compel them to come in.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112909"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;22:9</a>; <a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse23">Luke&nbsp;14:23</a></span> Although, however, you owe sincerest affection to those good servants of His through whose instrumentality you were compelled to come in, yet it is your duty, nevertheless, to place your hope on Him who prepared the banquet, by whom also you have been persuaded to come to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and blessed life. Committing to Him your heart, your vow, and your sacred <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, hope, and charity, you will not be moved by offenses, which shall abound even to the end; but, by the unshaken strength of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, shall be safe and shall triumph in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, continuing in the unity of His body even to the end. Let me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, by your answer, with what sentiments you regard my anxiety for you, to which I have to the best of my ability given expression in this letter. May the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy of God ever protect you!</p>
