<h1>Letter 20 (A.D. 390)</h1>

<p> <em>To Antoninus Augustine Sends Greeting.</em></p>

<p>1. As letters are due to you by two of us, a part of our debt is repaid with very abundant <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a> when you see one of the two in person; and since by his voice you, as it were, hear my own, I might have refrained from writing, had I not been called to do it by the urgent request of the very person whose journey to you seemed to me to make this unnecessary. Accordingly I now hold converse with you even more satisfactorily than if I were personally with you, because you both read my letter, and you listen to the words of one in whose heart you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I dwell. I have with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> studied and pondered the letter sent by your Holiness, because it exhibits both your <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> spirit unsullied by the guile of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> age, and your heart full of kindly feeling towards myself.</p>

<p>2. I congratulate you, and I give thanks to our God and Lord, because of the hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which are in you; and I thank you, in Him, for thinking so well of me as to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me to be a faithful servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which with guileless heart you cherish towards that which you commend in me; although, indeed, there is occasion rather for congratulation than for thanks in acknowledging your goodwill in this thing. For it is profitable for yourself that you should <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for its own sake that goodness which he of course loves who loves another because he believes him to be good, whether that other be or be not what he is supposed to be. One <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> only is to be carefully avoided in this matter, that we do not think otherwise than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> demands, not of the individual, but of that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> goodness in man. But, my brother well beloved, seeing that you are not in any degree mistaken either in believing or in <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the great good for men is to serve God cheerfully and purely, when you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> any man because you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him to share this good, you reap the reward, even though the man be not what you suppose him to be. Wherefore it is fitting that you should on this account be congratulated; but the person whom you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is to be congratulated, not because of his being for that reason loved, but because of his being <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> (if it is the case) such an one as the person who for this reason loves him esteems him to be. As to our real character, therefore, and as to the progress we may have made in the divine life, this is seen by Him whose judgment, both as to that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in man, and as to each man's personal character, cannot <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>. For your obtaining the reward of blessedness so far as this matter is concerned, it is sufficient that you embrace me with your whole heart because you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me to be such a servant of God as I ought to be. To you, however, I also render many thanks for this, that you encourage me wonderfully to aspire after such excellence, by your praising me as if I had already attained it. Many more thanks still shall be yours, if you not only claim an interest in my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, but also cease not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me. For intercession on behalf of a brother is more acceptable to God when it is offered as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>3. I greet very kindly your little son, and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that he may grow up in the way of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the salutary requirements of God's law. I desire and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, moreover, that the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and worship, which alone is catholic, may prosper and increase in your house; and if you think any labour on my part necessary for the promotion of this end, do not scruple to claim my service, relying upon Him who is our common Lord, and upon the law of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which we must <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. This especially would I recommend to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> discretion, that by reading the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and by serious conversation with your partner,  you should either plant the seed or foster the growth in her heart of an intelligent <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is scarcely possible that any one who is concerned for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> welfare, and is therefore without prejudice resolved to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, should fail, when enjoying the guidance of a good instructor, to discern the difference which exists between every form of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> and the one <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
