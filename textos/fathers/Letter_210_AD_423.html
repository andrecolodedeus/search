<h1>Letter 210 (A.D. 423)</h1>

<p> <em>To the Most Beloved and Most Holy Mother Felicitas</em>,  <em>and Brother Rusticus, and to the Sisters Who are with Them, Augustine and Those Who are with Him Send Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. Good is the Lord, and to every place extends His mercy, which comforts us by your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to us in Him. How much He loves those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and hope in Him, and who both <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Him and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another, and what blessings He keeps in store for them hereafter, He proves most remarkably in this, that on the unbelieving, the abandoned, and the perverse, whom He threatens with <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a>, if they persevere in their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition to the end, He does in this life bestow so many benefits, making <q>His sun to rise on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and on the good,</q> <q>on the just and on the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112916"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;5:45</a></span> words in which, for the sake of brevity, some instances are mentioned that many more may be suggested to reflection; for who can reckon up how many gracious benefits the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> receive in this life from Him whom they despise? Amongst these, this is one of great value, that by the experience of the occasional afflictions, which like a good physician He mingles the pleasures of this life, He admonishes them, if only they will give heed, to flee from the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> to come, and while they are in the way, that is, in this life, to agree with the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which they have made an adversary to themselves by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> lives. What, then, is not bestowed in mercy on men by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord God</a>, since even affliction sent by Him is a blessing? For prosperity is a gift of God when He comforts, adversity a gift of God when He warns; and if He bestows these things, as I have said, even on the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, what does He prepare for those who bear with one another? Into this number you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you have been gathered, <q>forbearing one another in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112917"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;4:2-3</a></span> For there shall not be awanting occasion for your bearing one with another till God shall have so purified you, that, death being <q>swallowed up in victory,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112918"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:24</a></span> <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall be all in all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112919"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:28</a></span> </p>

<p>2. We ought never, indeed, to take pleasure in quarrels; but however averse we may be to them, they occasionally either arise from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, or put it to the test. For how difficult is it to find any one willing to be reproved; and where is the wise man of whom it is said, <q>Rebuke a wise man, and he will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note112920"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse8">Proverbs&nbsp;9:8</a></span> But are we on that account not to reprove and find fault with a brother, to prevent him from going down through false security to death? For it is a common and frequent experience, that when a brother is found fault with he is mortified at the time, and resists and contradicts his friend, but afterwards reconsiders the matter in silence alone with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where he is not afraid of giving offense to men by submitting to correction, but is afraid of offending God by refusing to be reformed, and thenceforward refrains from doing that for which he has been <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> reproved; and in proportion as he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he loves the brother whom he feels to have been the enemy of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But if he belong to the number of those of whom it is said, <q>Reprove not a scorner lest he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112921"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse8">Proverbs&nbsp;9:8</a></span> the quarrel does not arise from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> on the part of the reproved, but it exercises and tests the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the reprover; for he does not return <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> for <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which constrains him to find fault endures unmoved, even when he who is found fault with requites it with <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. But if the reprover renders <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the man who takes offense at being reproved, he was not worthy to reprove another, but evidently deserves to be himself reproved. Act upon these principles, so that either quarrels may not arise, or, if they do arise, may quickly terminate in peace. Be more earnest to dwell in concord than to vanquish each other in controversy. For as vinegar corrodes a vessel if it remain long in it, so <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> corrodes the heart if it is cherished till the morrow. These things, therefore, observe, and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace shall be with you. Pray also unitedly for us, that we may cheerfully practise the good advices which we give to you.</p>
