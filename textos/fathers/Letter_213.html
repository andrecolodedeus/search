<h1>Letter 213</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>Without address</em>.</p>

<p>1. May the Lord, Who has brought me prompt help in my afflictions, grant you the help of the refreshment wherewith you have refreshed me by writing to me, rewarding you for your consolation of my <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> self with the real and great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of the Spirit. For I was indeed downcast in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> when I saw in a great multitude the almost brutish and unreasonable insensibility of the people, and the inveterate and ineradicable unsatisfactoriness of their leaders. But I saw your letter; I saw the treasure of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which it contained; then I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that He Who ordains all our lives had made some sweet consolation shine on me in the bitterness of my life. I therefore salute your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> in return, and exhort you, as is my wont, not to cease to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for my unhappy life, that I may never, drowned in the unrealities of this world, forget <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>who raises up the poor out of the dust;</q>  that I may never be lifted up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and fall into the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>;  that I may never be found by the Lord neglectful of my stewardship and asleep; never discharging it amiss, and wounding the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of my fellow-servants;  and, never companying with the drunken, suffer the pains threatened in God's just judgment against <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> stewards. I beseech you, therefore, in all your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> God that I may be watchful in all things; that I may be no shame or disgrace to the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in the revelation of the secrets of my heart, in the great day of the appearing of our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>.</p>

<p>2. Know then that I am expecting to be summoned by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the court, in the name of peace. Learn too that on being so informed, this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>  wrote to me to hasten to Mesopotamia, and, after assembling together those who in that country are of like sentiments with us, and are strengthening the state of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to travel in their company to the emperor. But perhaps my health will not be good enough to allow me to undertake a journey in the winter. Indeed, hitherto I have not thought the matter pressing, unless you advise it. I shall therefore await your counsel that my mind may be made up. Lose no time then, I beg you, in making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me, by means of one of our trusty brethren, what course seems best to the divinely guided intelligence of your excellency.</p>
