<h1>Letter 218</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p>To Amphilochius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Iconium.</p>

<p>Brother &AElig;lianus has himself completed the business concerning which he came, and has stood in need of no aid from me. I owe him, however, double thanks, both for bringing me a letter from your reverence and for affording me an opportunity of writing to you. By him, therefore, I salute your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and unfeigned <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and beseech you to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me more than ever now, when I stand in such need of the aid of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. My health has suffered terribly from the journey to <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> and my sickness is unendurable. One thing I have long been anxious to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you. I do not mean to say that I have been so affected by any other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as to forget it, but now I wish to put you in mind to send some <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man into Lycia, to enquire who are of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, for perhaps they ought not to be neglected, if indeed the report is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, which has been brought to me by a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> traveller from thence, that they have become altogether alienated from the opinion of the Asiani  and wish to embrace communion with us. If any one is to go let him enquire at Corydala  for Alexander, the late <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; at Limyra  for Diotimus, and at Myra  for Tatianus, Polemo,  and Macarius <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>; at Patara  for Eudemus,  the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; at Telmessus  for Hilarius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; at Phelus for Lallianus, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Of these and of more besides I have been informed that they are sound in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and I have been grateful to God that even any in the Asian region should be clear of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic's</a> pest. If, then, it be possible, let us in the meanwhile make personal enquiry about them. When we have obtained information I am for writing a letter, and am anxious to invite one of them to meet me. God grant that all may go well with that Church at Iconium, which is so dear to me. Through you I salute all the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and all who are associated with your reverence.</p>
