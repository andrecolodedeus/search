<h1>Letter 218 (A.D. 426)</h1>

<p> <em>To Palatinus, My Well-Beloved Lord and Son, Most Tenderly Longed For, Augustine Sends Greeting.</em></p>

<p>1. Your life of eminent <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and fruitfulness towards the Lord our God has brought to us great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For <q>you have made choice of instruction from your youth upwards, that you may still find wisdom even to grey hairs;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112938"><a href="../bible/sir006.htm#verse18">Sirach&nbsp;6:18</a></span> for <q>wisdom is the grey hair unto men, and an unspotted life is old age;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112939"><a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse9">Wisdom&nbsp;4:9</a></span> which may the Lord, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how to give good gifts unto His children, give to you asking, seeking, knocking. <span class="stiki" id="note112940"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;7:11</a></span> Although you have many counsellors and many counsels to direct you in the path which leads to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and although, above all, you have the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which has so effectually spoken in saving power in your heart, nevertheless we also, as in duty bound by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which we owe to you, offer to you, in hereby reciprocating your salutation, some words of counsel, designed not to awaken you as one hindered by sloth or sleep, but to stimulate and quicken you in the race which you are already running.</p>

<p>2. You require wisdom, my son, for steadfastness in this race, as it was under the influence of wisdom that you entered on it at first. Let this then be <q>a part of your wisdom, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whose gift it is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112941"><a href="../bible/wis008.htm#verse20">Wisdom&nbsp;8:20</a></span> <q>Commit your way unto the Lord; trust also in Him, and He shall bring it to pass: and He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your judgment as the noonday.</q>  <q>He will make straight your path, and guide your steps in peace.</q>  As you despised your prospects of greatness in this world, lest you should <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the abundance of riches which you had begun to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> after the manner of the children of this world, so now, in taking up the yoke of the Lord and His burden, let not your confidence be in your own strength; so shall <q>His yoke be easy, and His burden light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112944"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;11:30</a></span> For in the book of Psalms those are alike censured <q>who trust in their strength,</q> and <q>who boast themselves in the multitude of their riches.</q>  Therefore, as formerly you did not seek <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in riches, but most wisely despised that which you had begun to desire, so now be on your guard against insidious <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> to trust in your strength; for you are but man, and <q>cursed is every one that trusts in man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112946"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:5</a></span> But by all means trust in God with your whole heart, and He will Himself be your strength, wherein you may trust with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and thankfulness, and to Him you may say with humility and boldness, I will <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, O Lord, my strength;  because even the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which, when it is perfect, <q>casts out <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112948"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:18</a></span> is shed abroad in our hearts, not by our strength, that is, by any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> power, but, as the apostle says, <q>by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is given unto us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112949"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> </p>

<p>3. <q>Watch, therefore, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you enter not into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112950"><a href="../bible/mar014.htm#verse38">Mark&nbsp;14:38</a></span> Such <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is indeed in itself an admonition to you that you need the help of the Lord, and that you ought not to rest upon yourself your hope of living well. For now you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, not that you may obtain the riches and honours of this present world, or any unsubstantial <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> possession, but that you may not enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, a thing which would not be asked in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> if a man could accomplish it for himself by his own will. Wherefore we would not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may not enter into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> if our own will sufficed for our protection and yet if the will to avoid <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> were wanting to us, we could not so <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. It may, therefore, be present with us to will, <span class="stiki" id="note112951"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span> when we have through his own gift been made wise, but we must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may be able to perform that which we have so willed. In the fact that you have begun to exercise this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> wisdom, you have reason to give thanks. <q>For what have you which you have not received? But if you have received it, beware that you boast not as if you had not received it,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112952"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> that is, as if you could have had it of yourself. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a>, however, whence you have received it, ask Him by whose gift it was begun to grant that it may be perfected. <q>Work out your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and trembling: for it is God that works in you, both to will and to do, of His good pleasure;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112953"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;2:12-13</a></span> for <q>the will is prepared by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  and <q>the steps of a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way.</q>  Holy meditation on these things will preserve you, so that your wisdom shall be <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that is, that by God's gift you shall be good, and not ungrateful for the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>4. Your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, unfeignedly rejoicing with you in the better hope which in the Lord you have begun to cherish, are longing earnestly for your presence. But whether you be absent from us or present with us in the body, we desire to have you with us in the one Spirit by whom <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is shed abroad in our hearts, so that, in whatever place our bodies may sojourn, our spirits may be in no degree sundered from each other.</p>

<p>We have most thankfully received the cloaks of goat's-hair cloth  which you sent to us, in which gift you have yourself anticipated me in admonition as to the duty of being often engaged in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and of practising humility in our supplications.</p>
