<h1>Letter 219 (A.D. 436)</h1>

<p> <em>To Proculus and Cylinus, Brethren Most Beloved and Honourable, and Partners in the Sacerdotal Office, Augustine, Florentius, and Secundinus Send Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. When our son Leporius, whom for his obstinacy in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> you had <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> and fitly rebuked, came to us after he had been expelled by you, we received him as one afflicted for his good, whom we should, if possible, deliver from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and restore to spiritual health. For, as you <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> in regard to him the apostolic precept, <q>Warn the unruly,</q> so it was our part to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the precept immediately annexed, <q>Comfort the feeble-minded, and support the weak.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112957"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:14</a></span> His <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was indeed not unimportant, seeing that he neither approved what is right nor perceived what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in some things relating to the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, of whom it is written that, <q>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Word was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> but that when the fullness of time had come, <q>the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>, and dwelt among us;</q>  for he denied that God became man, regarding it as a doctrine from which it must follow necessarily that the divine substance in which He is equal to the Father suffered some unworthy change or corruption, and not seeing that he was thus introducing into the Trinity a fourth person, which is utterly contrary to the sound doctrine of the Creed and of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Since, however, dearly beloved and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> brethren, he had as a fallible man been overtaken in this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, we did our utmost, the Lord helping us, to instruct him <q>in the spirit of meekness,</q> especially remembering that when the chosen vessel gave this command to which we refer, he added, <q>Considering yourself, lest you also be tempted,</q>&mdash; lest some, perchance, should so <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the measure of spiritual progress as to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they could no longer be tempted like other men,&mdash; and joined with it the salutary and peace-promoting sentence, <q>Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</q> </p>

<p>2. This restoration of Leporius we could perhaps in nowise have accomplished, had you not previously censured and punished those things in him which required correction. So then the same Lord, our Divine Physician, using His own instruments and servants, has by you wounded him when he was <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and by us healed him when he was penitent, according to his own saying, <q>I wound, and I heal.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112960"><a href="../bible/deu032.htm#verse39">Deuteronomy&nbsp;32:39</a></span> The same Divine Ruler and Overseer of His own house has by you thrown down what was defective in the building, and has by us replaced with a well-ordered structure what he had removed. The same Divine Husbandman has in His careful diligence by you rooted up what was barren and noxious in His field, and by us planted what is useful and fruitful. Let us not, therefore, ascribe <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to ourselves, but to the mercy of Him in whose hand both we and all our words are. And as we humbly praise the work which you have done as His ministers in the case of our son aforesaid, so do you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in the work performed by us. Receive, then, with the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of fathers and of brethren, him whom we have with merciful severity corrected. For although one part of the work was done by you and another part by us, both parts, being indispensable to our brother's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, were done by the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. The same God was therefore working in both, for <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112961"><a href="../bible/1jo004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;4:8,&nbsp;16</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Wherefore, as he has been welcomed into fellowship by us on the ground of his repentance, let him be welcomed by you on the ground of his letter,  to which letter we have thought it right to adhibit our signatures attesting its genuiness. We have not the least <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that you, in the exercise of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, will not only hear with pleasure of his amendment, but also make it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those to whom his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was a stumbling-block. For those who came with him to us have also been corrected and restored along with him, as is declared by their signatures, which have been adhibited to the letter in our presence. It remains only that you, being made joyful by the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of a brother, condescend to make us joyful in our turn by sending a reply to our communication. Farewell in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, most beloved and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> brethren; such is our desire on your behalf: remember us.</p>
