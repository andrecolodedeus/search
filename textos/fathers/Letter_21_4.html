<h1>Letter 21</h1>

<p> <em>From Eutyches to Leo. </em></p>

<h2>I. He states his account of the proceedings at the Synod.</h2>

<p><a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> is before all else my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, being confident of my hope and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ the Lord and God of all, and discerning the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of my holding the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in these matters: but I call on your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, too, to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to my heart and to the reasonableness of my opinions and words. But the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has exercised his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influence upon my <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and determination, whereby his power ought to have been destroyed. Whereupon he has exerted all his proper power and aroused Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the town of Doryl&aelig;um, against me, who presented an allegation  to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the church in Constantinople, Flavian, and to certain others whom he found in the same city assembled on various matters of their own: in this he called me <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, not raising any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> accusation but contriving destruction for me and disturbance for the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Their holinesses summoned me to reply to his accusation: but though I was delayed by a serious illness besides my advanced age, I came to clear myself, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> well that a faction had been formed against my safety. And, indeed, together with a writ of appeal  to which my signature was appended, I offered them a statement showing my confession upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Faith. But when the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Flavian did not receive the document, nor order it to be read, yet heard me in reply utter word for word that Faith which was put forth at Nic&aelig;a by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, and confirmed at Ephesus, I was required to acknowledge two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> those who denied this. But I, fearing the decision of the synod, and not wishing either to take away or to add one word contrary to the Faith put forth by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod of Nic&aelig;a, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, too, that our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed fathers and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Julius, Felix, Athanasius, and Gregorius  rejected the phrase <q>two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>,</q> and not daring to discuss the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a>, who came into flesh in the last days entering the womb of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> virgin Mary unchangeably as he willed and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, becoming man in reality, not in fancy, nor yet venturing to <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> our aforesaid Fathers, I asked them to let your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, that you might judge what seemed right to you, undertaking by all means to follow your ruling.</p>

<h2>II. His explanations were allowed no hearing.</h2>

<p>But without listening to any thing which I said, they broke up the Synod and published the sentence of my degradation, which they were getting ready against me before the inquiry. So much <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> were they factiously making up against me that even my safety would have been endangered had not the help of God at the intercession of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> quickly snatched me from the assault of military force. Then they began to force the heads of other <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a>  to subscribe to my degradation (a thing which was never done either towards those who have professed themselves <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, nor even against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> himself), insomuch that when to reassure the people I tried to set forth  statements of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not only did they, who were plotting the aforesaid faction against me, prevent them being heard, but also seized them that straightway I might be held a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> before all.</p>

<h2>III. He appeals to Leo for protection.</h2>

<p>I take refuge, therefore, with you the defender of religion and abhorrer of such factions, bringing in even still nothing strange against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as it was originally handed down to us, but <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, Manes, and <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and those who say that the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, descended from heaven and not from the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin, along with all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> down to <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>. Yet nevertheless I stand in jeopardy of my life as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. I beseech you not to be prejudiced against me by their insidious designs about me, but to pronounce the sentence which shall seem to you right upon the Faith, and in future not to allow any <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> to be uttered against me by this faction, nor let one be expelled and banished from the number of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> who has spent his seventy years of life in continence and all <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, so that at the very end of life he should suffer shipwreck. I have subjoined to this my letter both documents, that which was presented by my accuser at the Synod, and that which was brought by me but not received, as well as the statement of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and those things which have been decreed upon the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers. </p>

<p> <em>Eutyches' Confession of Faith.</em></p>

<p>I call upon you before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who gives life to all things, and Christ Jesus, who witnessed that good confession under <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pontius Pilate</a>, that you do nothing by favour. For I have held the same as my forefathers and from my boyhood have been illuminated by the same Faith as that which was laid down by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod of 318 most blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were gathered at Nic&aelig;a from the whole world, and which was confirmed and ratified afresh for sole acceptance by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod assembled at Ephesus: and I have never thought otherwise than as the right and only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith has enjoined. And I agree to everything that was laid down about the same Faith by the same <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod: of which Synod the leader and chief was Cyril of blessed memory <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Alexandrians, the partner and sharer in the preaching and in the Faith of those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and elect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Gregory the greater, and the other Gregory , Basil, Athanasius, Atticus and Proclus. Him and all of them I have held <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> and faithful, and have honoured as <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and have esteemed my masters. But I utter an <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> on <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> down to Simon, and those who say that the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> came down from heaven. For He who is the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> came down from heaven without flesh and was made flesh in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Virgin's womb unchangeably and unalterably as He Himself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> and willed. And He who was always perfect God before the ages, was also made perfect man in the end of the days for us and for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. This my full profession may your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> consider.</p>

<p>I, Eutyches, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and archimandrite, have subscribed to this statement with my own hand.</p>
