<h1>Letter 21 (A.D. 391)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Lord Bishop Valerius, Most Blessed and Venerable, My Father Most Warmly Cherished with True Love in the Sight of the Lord, Augustine, Presbyter, Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. Before all things I ask your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> wisdom to take into consideration that, on the one hand, if the duties of the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, be discharged in a perfunctory and time-serving manner, no work can be in this life more easy, agreeable, and likely to secure the favour of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, especially in our day, but none at the same time more miserable, deplorable, and worthy of condemnation in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and, on the other hand, that if in the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, the orders of the Captain of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> be observed, there is no work in this life more difficult, toilsome, and hazardous, especially in our day, but none at the same time more <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  But what the proper mode of discharging these duties is, I did not learn either in boyhood or in the earlier years of manhood; and at the time when I was beginning to learn it, I was constrained as a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> correction for my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> (for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what else to think) to accept the second place at the helm, when as yet I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not how to handle an oar.</p>

<p>2. But I think that it was the purpose of my Lord hereby to rebuke me, because I presumed, as if entitled by superior <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and excellence, to reprove the faults of many sailors before I had learned by experience the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of their work. Therefore, after I had been sent in among them to share their labours, then I began to feel the rashness of my censures; although even before that time I judged this office to be beset with many dangers. And hence the tears which some of my brethren perceived me shedding in the city at the time of my ordination, and because of which they did their utmost with the best intentions to console me, but with words which, through their not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the causes of my sorrow, did not reach my case at all.  But my experience has made me realize these things much more both in degree and in measure than I had done in merely thinking of them: not that I have now seen any new waves or storms of which I had not previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> by observation, or report, or reading, or meditation; but because I had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> my own skill or strength for avoiding or encountering them, and had estimated it to be of some value instead of none. The Lord, however, laughed at me, and was pleased to show me by actual experience what I am.</p>

<p>3. But if He has done this not in judgment, but in mercy, as I confidently hope even now, when I have learned my infirmity, my duty is to study with diligence all the remedies which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> contain for such a case as mine, and to make it my business by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and reading to secure that my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be endued with the health and vigour necessary for labours so responsible. This I have not yet done, because I have not had time; for I was ordained at the very time when I was thinking of having, along with others, a season of freedom from all other occupation, that we might acquaint ourselves with the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, and was intending to make such arrangements as would secure unbroken leisure for this great work. Moreover, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that I did not at any earlier period <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how great was my unfitness for the arduous work which now disquiets and crushes my spirit. But if I have by experience learned what is necessary for a man who ministers to a people in the divine <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and word, only to find myself prevented from now obtaining what I have learned that I do not possess, do you bid me perish, father Valerius? Where is your charity? Do you indeed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me? Do you indeed <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to which you have appointed me, thus unqualified, to minister? I am well assured that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> both; but you think me qualified, while I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> myself better; and yet I would not have come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> myself if I had not learned by experience.</p>

<p>4. Perhaps your Holiness replies: I wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is lacking to fit you for your office. The things which I lack are so many, that I could more easily enumerate the things which I have than those which I desire to have. I may venture to say that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and unreservedly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the doctrines pertaining to our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But my difficulty is in the question how I am to use this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in ministering to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others, seeking what is profitable not for myself alone, but for many, that they may be saved. And perhaps there may be, nay, beyond all question there are, written in the sacred books, counsels by the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and acceptance of which the man of God may so discharge his duties to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or at least so keep a <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> void of offense in the midst of ungodly men, whether living or dying, as to secure that that life for which alone <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> and meek <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> hearts sigh is not lost. But how can this be done, except, as the Lord Himself tells us, by asking, seeking, knocking, that is, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, reading, and weeping? For this I have by the brethren made the request, which in this petition I now renew, that a short time, say till <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, be granted me by your unfeigned and venerable charity.</p>

<p>5. For what shall I answer to the Lord my Judge? Shall I say, <q>I was not able to acquire the things of which I stood in need, because I was engrossed wholly with the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a></q>? What if He thus replies: <q>You  <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> servant, if property belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (in the collection of the fruits of which great labour is expended) were suffering loss under some oppressor, and it was in your power to do something in defence of her rights at the bar of an earthly judge, would you not, leaving the field which I have watered with my blood, go to plead the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> with the consent of all, and even with the urgent commands of some? And if the decision given were against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, would you not, in prosecuting an appeal, go across the sea; and would no complaint be heard summoning you home from an absence of a year or more, because your object was to prevent another from taking possession of land required not for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, but for the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, whose hunger might nevertheless be satisfied in a way much easier and more acceptable to me by my living trees, if these were cultivated with care? Wherefore, then, do you allege that you had not time to learn how to cultivate my field?</q> Tell me, I beseech you, what could I reply? Are you perchance willing that I should say, <q>The aged Valerius is to blame; for, believing me to be instructed in all things necessary, he declined, with a determination proportioned to his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for me, to give me permission to learn what I had not acquired?</q></p>

<p>6. Consider all these things, aged Valerius; consider them, I beseech you, by the goodness and severity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by His mercy and judgment, by Him who has inspired you with such <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for me that I dare not displease you, even when the advantage of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is at stake. You, moreover, appeal to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to Christ to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to me concerning your innocence and charity, and the sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which you bear to me, just as if all these were not things about which I may myself willingly take my <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. I therefore appeal to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and affection which you have thus avouched. Have pity on me, and grant me, for the purpose for which I have asked it, the time which I have asked; and help me with your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, that my desire may not be in vain, and that my absence may not be without fruit to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to the profit of my brethren and fellow-servants. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the Lord will not despise your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> interceding for me, especially in such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as this; and accepting it as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of sweet savour, He will restore me to you, perhaps, within a period shorter than I have craved, thoroughly furnished for His service by the profitable counsels of His written word.</p>
