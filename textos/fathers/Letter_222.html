<h1>Letter 222</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To the people of Chalcis</em>. </p>

<p>The letter of your reverences came upon me in an hour of affliction like water poured into the mouths of racehorses, inhaling dust with each eager breath at high noontide in the middle of the course. Beset by trial after trial, I breathed again, at once cheered by your words and invigorated by the thought of your struggles to meet that which is before me with unflinching <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>. For the conflagration which has devoured a great part of the East is already advancing by slow degrees into our own neighbourhood, and after burning everything round about us is trying to reach even the Churches in Cappadocia, already moved to tears by the smoke that rises from the ruins of our neighbours' homes.  The flames have almost reached me. May the Lord divert them by the breath of His mouth, and stay this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> fire. Who is such a coward, so unmanly, so untried in the athlete's struggles, as not to be nerved to the fight by your cheers, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to be hailed victor at your side? You have been the first to step into the arena of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion; you have beaten off many an attack in bouts with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; you have borne the strong hot wind  of trial, both you who are leaders of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to whom has been the ministry of the altar, and every individual of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, including those of higher rank. For this in you is specially admirable and worthy of all praise, that you are all one in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, some of you leaders in the march to what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, others willingly following. It is for this reason that you are too strong for the attack of your assailants, and allow no hold to your antagonists in any one of your members, wherefore day and night I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the King of the ages to preserve the people in the integrity of their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and for them to preserve the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, like a head unharmed at the top, exercising its own watchful forethought for every portion of the body underneath. For while the eyes discharge their functions, the hands can do their work as they ought, the feet can move without tripping, and no part of the body is deprived of due care. I beseech you, then, to cling to one another, as you are doing and as you will do. I beseech you who are entrusted with the care of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to keep each and all together, and to cherish them like beloved children. I beseech the people to continue to show you the respect and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to fathers, that in the goodly order of your Church you may keep your strength and the foundation of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Christ; that God's name may be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> and the good gift of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> increase and abound. May I, as I hear of you, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in your progress in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If I am still bidden to sojourn in the flesh in this world, may I one day see you in the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If I be now summoned to depart this life, may I see you in the radiant <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, together with all them who are accounted worthy through patience and showing forth of good works, with crowns upon your heads.</p>
