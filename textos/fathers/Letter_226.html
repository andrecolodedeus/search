<h1>Letter 226</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a> under him.</p>

<p>It may be that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> God will grant me the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of a meeting with you, for I am ever longing to see you and hear about you, because in no other thing do I find rest for my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> than in your progress and perfection in the commandments of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But so long as this hope remains unrealized I feel bound to visit you through the instrumentality of our dear and God-fearing brethren, and to address you, my beloved friends, by letter. Wherefore I have sent my reverend and dear brother and fellow-worker in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, Meletius the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. He will tell you my yearning affection for you, and the anxiety of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in that, night and day, I beseech the Lord in your behalf, that I may have boldness in the day of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> through your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and that when your work is tried by the just <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> you may shine forth in the brightness of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. At the same time the difficulties of the day <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> me deep anxiety, for all Churches have been tossed to and fro, and all <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are being sifted. Some have even opened their mouths without any reserve against their fellow servants. Lies are boldly uttered, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been hidden. The accused are being condemned without a trial, and the accusers are <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> without evidence. I had heard that many letters are being carried about against myself, stinging, gibbeting, and attacking me for matters about which I have my defence ready for the tribunal of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and I had intended to keep silence, as indeed I have done; for now for three years I have been bearing the blows of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> and the whips of accusation, content to think that I have the Lord, Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all secrets, as <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of its <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. But I see now that many men have silence as a corroboration of these <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a>, and have formed the idea that my silence was due, not to my longsuffering, but to my inability to open my lips in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For these reasons I have attempted to write to you, beseeching your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in Christ not to accept these partial <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, because, as it is written, the law judges no man unless it have heard and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> his actions. </p>

<p>2. Nevertheless before a fair judge the facts themselves are a sufficient demonstration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Wherefore, even if I be silent, you can look at events. The very men who are now indicting me for heterodoxy have been seen openly numbered with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> faction. The very accusers who condemn me for other men's writings, are plainly contravening their own confessions, given to me by them in writing. Look at the conduct of the exhibitors of this audacity. It is their invariable custom to go over to the party in power, to trample on their weaker friends, and to court the strong. The writers of those famous letters against Eudoxius and all his faction, the senders of them to all the brotherhood, the protesters that they shun their communion as fatal to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and would not accept the votes given for their deposition, because they were given by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as they persuaded me then&mdash;these very men, completely forgetful of all this, have joined their faction.  No room for denial is left them. They laid their mind bare when they embraced private communion with them at Ancyra, when they had not yet been publicly received by them. Ask them, then, if <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, who gave communion to Ecdicius, is now <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, why when returning from Dardania, did they overthrow his altars in the territory of Gangra, and set up their own tables?  Why have they comparatively recently  attacked the churches of Amasea and Zela and appointed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> there themselves? If they communicate with them as <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, why do they attack them as <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>? If they hold them to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, how is it that they do not shun communion with them? Is it not, my <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> brethren, plain even to the intelligence of a child, that it is always with a view to some personal advantage that they endeavour to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> or to give support? So they have stood off from me, not because I did not write in reply (which is alleged to be the main ground of offense), nor because I did not receive the <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a> whom they assert they sent. Those who are trumping up the tale will render an account to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. One man, Eustathius,  was sent and gave a letter to the court of the vicar, and spent three days in the city. When he was on the point of going home, it is said that he came to my house late in the evening, when I was asleep. On hearing that I was asleep, he went away; he did not come near me on the next day, and after thus going through the mere form of discharging his duty to me, departed. This is the charge under which I am guilty. This is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against which these long-suffering people have neglected to weigh the previous service wherein I served them in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> they have made their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against me so severe that they have caused me to be denounced in all the Churches throughout the world&mdash; at least, that is, wherever they could.</p>

<p>3. But of course this is not the real <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of our separation. It was when they found that they would recommend themselves to Euzoius  if they were alienated from me, that they devised these pretences. The object was to find some ground of recommendation with the authorities for their attack upon me. Now they are beginning to run down even the Nicene Creed, and nickname me <em>Homoousiast</em>, because in that creed the Only begotten Son is said to be <em>homoousios</em> with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. Not that one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is divided into two kindred parts; God forbid! This was not the meaning of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and God-beloved synod; their meaning was that what the Father is in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, such is the Son. And thus they themselves have explained it to us, in the phrase <em>Light of Light</em>. Now it is the Nicene Creed, brought by themselves from the west, which they presented to the Synod at Tyana, by which they were received.  But they have an ingenious theory as to changes of this kind; they use the words of the creed as physicians use a remedy for the particular moment, and substitute now one and now another to suit particular diseases. The unsoundness of such a sophism it is rather for you to consider than for me to prove. For <q>the Lord will give you understanding</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322922"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:7</a></span> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is the right doctrine, and what the crooked and perverse. If indeed we are to subscribe one creed today and another tomorrow, and shift with the seasons, then is the declaration false of him who said, <q>One Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322923"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> But if it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then <q>Let no man deceive you with [these] vain words.</q> They <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accuse me of introducing novelties about the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Ask what the novelty is. I confess what I have received, that the Paraclete is ranked with Father and Son, and not numbered with created beings. We have made profession of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Wherefore we never separate the Spirit from conjunction  with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. For our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, enlightened by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, looks at the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and in Him, as in an image, beholds the Father. And I do not invent names of myself, but call the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> Paraclete; nor do I consent to destroy His due <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. These are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> my doctrines. If any one wishes to accuse me for them, let him accuse me; let my persecutor <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> me. Let him who believes in the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> against me be ready for the judgment. <q>The Lord is at hand.</q> <q>I am careful for nothing.</q> </p>

<p>4. If any one in <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> is writing, this is nothing to me. For it is said <q>By your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322926"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;12:37</a></span> Let my own words judge me. Let no one condemn me for other men's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> nor adduce letters written twenty years ago in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that I would allow communion to the writers of such things. Before these things were written, and before any suspicion of this kind had been stirred against them, I did write as <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>. I wrote nothing about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in any way like that which they are now carrying about to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> me. I sent nothing but a mere greeting to return a friendly communication, for I shun and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> as impious alike all who are affected with the unsoundness of Sabellius, and all who maintain the opinions of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. If any one says that Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are the same, and supposes one thing under several names, and one hypostasis described by three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, I rank such an one as belonging to the faction of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.  Similarly, if any one says that the Son is in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> unlike the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or degrades the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> into a creature, I <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> him, and say that he is coming near to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But it is impossible for the mouths of my accusers to be restrained by my letter; rather is it likely that they are being irritated at my defence, and are getting up new and more violent attacks against me. But it is not difficult for your ears to be guarded. Wherefore, as far as in you lies, do as I bid you. Keep your heart clear and unprejudiced by their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>; and insist on my rendering an account to meet the charges laid against me. If you find that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is on my side do not yield to lies; if on the other hand you feel that I am feeble in defending myself, then <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> my accusers as being worthy of credit. They pass sleepless nights to do me mischief. I do not ask this of you. They are taking to a commercial career, and turning their <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> against me into a means of profit. I implore you on the other hand to stop at home, and to lead a decorous life, quietly doing Christ's work.  I advise you to avoid communication with them, for it always tends to the perversion of their hearers. I say this that you may keep your affection for the uncontaminated, may preserve the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Fathers in its integrity, and may appear approved before the Lord as friends of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>
