<h1>Letter 227 (A.D. 428 or 429)</h1>

<p> <em>To the Aged Alypius, Augustine Sends Greeting.</em></p>

<p>Brother Paulus has arrived here safely: he reports that the pains devoted to the business which engaged him have been rewarded with success; the Lord will grant that with these his trouble in that matter may terminate. He salutes you warmly, and tells us tidings concerning Gabinianus which give us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, namely, that having by God's mercy obtained a prosperous issue in his case, he is now not only in name a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, but in sincerity a very excellent convert to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> recently at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, having both in his heart and on his lips the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which he received. How much I long for him I can never express; but you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> him.</p>

<p>The president of the medical faculty,  Dioscorus, has also professed the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, having obtained <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> at the same time. Hear the manner of his conversion, for his stubborn neck and his bold tongue could not be subdued without some <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. His daughter, the only comfort of his life, was sick, and her sickness became so serious that her life was, according even to her father's own admission, despaired of. It is reported, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the report is beyond question, for even before brother <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> return the fact was mentioned to me by Count Peregrinus, a most respectable and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man, who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at the same time with Dioscorus and Gabinianus,&mdash; it is reported, I say, that the old man, feeling himself at last constrained to implore the compassion of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, bound himself by a vow that he would become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> if he saw her restored to health. She recovered, but he perfidiously drew back from fulfilling his vow. Nevertheless the hand of the Lord was still stretched forth, for suddenly he is smitten with blindness, and immediately the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this calamity was impressed upon his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. He confessed his fault aloud, and vowed again that if his sight were given back he would perform what he had vowed. He recovered his sight, fulfilled his vow, and still the hand of God was stretched forth. He had not committed the Creed to memory, or perhaps had refused to commit it, and had excused himself on the plea of inability. God had seen this. Immediately after all the ceremonies of his reception he is seized with paralysis, affecting many, indeed almost all his members, and even his tongue. Then, being warned by a dream, he confesses in writing that it had been told to him that this had happened because he had not repeated the Creed. After that confession the use of all his members was restored to him, except the tongue alone; nevertheless he, being still under this affliction, made manifest by writing that he had, notwithstanding, learned the Creed, and still retained it in his memory; and so that frivolous loquacity which, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, blemished his natural kindliness, and made him, when he mocked <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, exceedingly profane, was altogether destroyed in him. What shall I say, but, <q>Let us sing a hymn to the Lord, and highly exalt Him for ever! <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</q></p>
