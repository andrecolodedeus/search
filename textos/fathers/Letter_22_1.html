<h1>Letter 22</h1>

<p><strong>To Eustochium</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Perhaps the most famous of all the letters. In it Jerome lays down at great length (1) the motives which ought to actuate those who devote themselves to a life of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, and (2) the rules by which they ought to regulate their daily conduct. The letter contains a vivid picture of Roman society as it then was&mdash; the luxury, profligacy, and hypocrisy prevalent among both men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, besides some graphic autobiographical details (&sect;&sect;7, 30), and concludes with a full account of the three kinds of monasticism then practised in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> (&sect;&sect;34-36). Thirty years later Jerome wrote a similar letter to Demetrias (CXXX.), with which this ought to be compared. Written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 384 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. <q>Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear; forget also your own people and your father's house, and the king shall desire your beauty.</q>  In this forty-fourth  psalm God speaks to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that, following the example of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>,  it should go out from its own land and from its kindred, and should leave the Chaldeans, that is the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and should dwell in the country of the living, for which elsewhere the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> sighs: <q>I think to see the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the Lord in the land of the living.</q>  But it is not enough for you to go out from your own land unless you forget your people and your father's house; unless you scorn the flesh and cling to the bridegroom in a close embrace. <q>Look not behind you,</q> he says, <q>neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain lest you be consumed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300335"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;19:17</a></span> He who has grasped the plough must not look behind him <span class="stiki" id="note300336"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse62">Luke&nbsp;9:62</a></span> or return home from the field, or having Christ's garment, descend from the roof to fetch other raiment. <span class="stiki" id="note300337"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;24:17-18</a></span> Truly a marvellous thing, a father charges his daughter not to remember her father. <q>You are of your father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of your father it is your will to do.</q>  So it was said to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And in another place, <q>He that commits <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300339"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:8</a></span> Born, in the first instance, of such parentage we are naturally black, and even when we have repented, so long as we have not scaled the heights of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, we may still say: <q>I am black but comely, O you daughters of Jerusalem.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300340"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse5">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:5</a></span> But you will say to me, <q>I have left the home of my childhood; I have forgotten my father, I am born anew in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. What reward do I receive for this?</q> The context shows&mdash; <q>The king shall desire your beauty.</q> This, then, is the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>. <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be</q> not as is there said, <q>of one flesh,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300341"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse31">Ephesians&nbsp;5:31-32</a></span> but <q>of one spirit.</q> Your bridegroom is not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> or disdainful; He has <q>married an <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300342"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse1">Numbers&nbsp;12:1</a></span> When once you desire the wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Solomon and come to Him, He will avow all His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to you; He will lead you into His chamber with His royal hand; <span class="stiki" id="note300343"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse4">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:4</a></span> He will miraculously change your complexion so that it shall be said of you, <q>Who is this that goes up and has been made white?</q> </p>

<p>2. I write to you thus, Lady <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> (I am bound to call my Lord's bride <q>lady</q>), to show you by my opening words that my object is not to praise the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which you follow, and of which you have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the value, or yet to recount the drawbacks of marriage, such as pregnancy, the crying of infants, the torture caused by a rival, the cares of household management, and all those fancied blessings which death at last cuts short. Not that married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are as such outside the pale; they have their own place, the marriage that is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> and the bed undefiled. <span class="stiki" id="note300345"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> My purpose is to show you that you are fleeing from <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> and should take warning by <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot's</a> wife. <span class="stiki" id="note300346"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;19:26</a></span> There is no flattery, I can tell you, in these pages. A flatterer's words are fair, but for all that he is an enemy. You need expect no rhetorical flourishes setting you among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and while they extol <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> as blessed, putting the world at your feet.</p>

<p>3. I would have you draw from your monastic vow not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> but <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300347"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;11:20</a></span> You walk laden with gold; you must keep out of the robber's way. To us men this life is a race-course: we contend here, we are crowned elsewhere. No man can lay aside <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> while serpents and scorpions beset his path. The Lord says: <q>My sword has drunk its fill in heaven,</q>  and do you expect to find peace on the earth? No, the earth yields only thorns and thistles, and its dust is food for the serpent.  <q>For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual hosts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the heavenly places.</q>  We are hemmed in by hosts of foes, our enemies are upon every side. The weak flesh will soon be ashes: one against many, it fights against tremendous odds. Not till it has been dissolved, not till the Prince of this world has come and found no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> therein,  not till then may you safely listen to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words: <q>You shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flies by day; nor for the trouble which haunts you in darkness; nor for the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> and his attacks at noonday. A thousand shall fall at your side and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you.</q>  When the hosts of the enemy distress you, when your frame is fevered and your <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> roused, when you say in your heart, <q>What shall I do?</q> Elisha's words shall give you your answer, <q>Fear not, for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300353"><a href="../bible/2ki006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;6:16</a></span> He shall <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <q>Lord, open the eyes of your handmaid that she may see.</q> And then when your eyes have been opened you shall see a fiery chariot like Elijah's waiting to carry you to heaven,  and shall joyfully sing: <q>Our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken and we are escaped.</q> </p>

<p>4. So long as we are held down by this frail body, so long as we have our treasure in earthen vessels; <span class="stiki" id="note300356"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:7</a></span> so long as the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note300357"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> there can be no sure victory. <q>Our adversary the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> goes about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300358"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> <q>You make darkness,</q> David says, <q>and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth. The young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> looks not for unbelievers, for those who are without, whose flesh the Assyrian king roasted in the furnace. <span class="stiki" id="note300360"><a href="../bible/jer029.htm#verse22">Jeremiah&nbsp;29:22</a></span> It is the church of Christ that he <q>makes haste to spoil.</q>  According to Habakkuk, <q>His food is of the choicest.</q>  A Job is the victim of his machinations, and after devouring Judas he seeks power to sift the [other] <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300363"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;22:31</a></span> The Saviour came not to send peace upon the earth but a sword. <span class="stiki" id="note300364"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;10:34</a></span> Lucifer fell, Lucifer who used to rise at dawn; <span class="stiki" id="note300365"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;14:12</a></span> and he who was bred up in a paradise of delight had the well-earned sentence passed upon him, <q>Though thou exalt yourself as the eagle, and though thou set your nest among the stars, thence will I bring you down, says the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300366"><a href="../bible/oba001.htm#verse4">Obadiah&nbsp;4</a></span> For he had said in his heart, <q>I will exalt my throne above the stars of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> and <q>I will be like the Most High.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300367"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;14:13-14</a></span> Wherefore God says every day to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as they descend the ladder that Jacob saw in his dream, <span class="stiki" id="note300368"><a href="../bible/gen028.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;28:12</a></span> <q>I have said you are Gods and all of you are children of the Most High. But you shall die like men and fall like one of the princes.</q>  The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> fell first, and since <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stands in the congregation of the Gods and judges among the Gods,</q>  the apostle writes to those who are ceasing to be Gods&mdash; <q>Whereas there is among you envying and strife, are you not carnal and walk as men?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300371"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> </p>

<p>5. If, then, the apostle, who was a chosen vessel <span class="stiki" id="note300372"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;9:15</a></span> separated unto the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300373"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse15">Galatians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> by reason of the pricks of the flesh and the allurements of <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> keeps under his body and brings it into subjection, lest when he has preached to others he may himself be a castaway; <span class="stiki" id="note300374"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:27</a></span> and yet, for all that, sees another law in his members warring against the law of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and bringing him into captivity to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note300375"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;7:23</a></span> if after nakedness, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, hunger, imprisonment, scourging and other torments, he turns back to himself and cries <q>Oh, wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300376"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> do you fancy that you ought to lay aside apprehension? See to it that God say not some day of you: <q>The virgin of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is fallen and there is none to raise her up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300377"><a href="../bible/amo005.htm#verse2">Amos&nbsp;5:2</a></span> I will say it boldly, though God can do all things He cannot raise up a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> when once she has fallen. He may indeed relieve one who is defiled from the penalty of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but He will not give her a crown. Let us <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest in us also the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> be fulfilled, <q>Good <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> shall faint.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300378"><a href="../bible/amo008.htm#verse13">Amos&nbsp;8:13</a></span> Notice that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who are spoken of, for there are bad ones as well. <q>Whosoever looks on a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> the Lord says, <q>to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her already in his heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300379"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> So that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> may be lost even by a thought. Such are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in the flesh, not in the spirit; foolish <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, who, having no oil, are shut out by the Bridegroom. </p>

<p>6. But if even real <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, when they have other failings, are not saved by their physical <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, what shall become of those who have prostituted the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and have changed the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> into a brothel? Straightway shall they hear the words: <q>Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, sit on the ground; there is no throne, O daughter of the Chald&aelig;ans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate. Take the millstone and grind meal; uncover your locks, make bare the legs, pass over the rivers; your nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, your shame shall be seen.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300381"><a href="../bible/isa047.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;47:1-3</a></span> And shall she come to this after the bridal-chamber of God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, after the kisses of Him who is to her both kinsman and spouse?  Yes, she of whom the prophetic utterance once sang, <q>Upon your right hand stood the queen in a vesture of gold wrought about with various colours,</q>  shall be made naked, and her skirts shall be discovered upon her face. <span class="stiki" id="note300384"><a href="../bible/jer013.htm#verse26">Jeremiah&nbsp;13:26</a></span> She shall sit by the waters of loneliness, her pitcher laid aside; and shall open her feet to every one that passes by, and shall be polluted to the crown of her head. <span class="stiki" id="note300385"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse25">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:25</a></span> Better had it been for her to have submitted to the yoke of marriage, to have walked in level places, than thus, aspiring to loftier heights, to fall into the deep of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, let not Zion the faithful city become a harlot: <span class="stiki" id="note300386"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse21">Isaiah&nbsp;1:21</a></span> let it not be that where the Trinity has been entertained, there <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> shall dance and owls make their nests, and jackals build.  Let us not loose the belt that binds the breast. When <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> tickles the sense and the soft fire of sensual pleasure sheds over us its pleasing glow, let us immediately break forth and cry: <q>The Lord is on my side: I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> what the flesh can do unto me.</q>  When the inner man shows signs for a time of wavering between <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, say: <q>Why art you cast down, O my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and why are you disquieted within me? Hope thou in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for I shall yet praise Him who is the health of my countenance and my God.</q>  You must never let suggestions of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> grow on you, or a babel of disorder win strength in your breast. Slay the enemy while he is small; and, that you may not have a crop of tares, nip the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in the bud. Bear in mind the warning words of the Psalmist: <q>Hapless daughter of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> shall he be that rewards you as you have served us. Happy shall he be that takes and dashes your little ones against the stones.</q>  Because natural heat inevitably kindles in a man sensual passion, he is praised and accounted <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who, when foul suggestions arise in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, gives them no quarter, but dashes them instantly against the rock. <q>Now the Rock is <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300391"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:4</a></span> </p>

<p>7. How often, when I was living in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, in the vast solitude which gives to hermits a savage dwelling-place, parched by a burning sun, how often did I fancy myself among the pleasures of Rome! I used to sit alone because I was filled with bitterness. Sackcloth disfigured my unshapely limbs and my skin from long neglect had become as black as an <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian's</a>. Tears and groans were every day my portion; and if drowsiness chanced to overcome my struggles against it, my bare bones, which hardly held together, clashed against the ground. Of my food and drink I say nothing: for, even in sickness, the solitaries have nothing but cold water, and to eat one's food cooked is looked upon as self-indulgence. Now, although in my <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> I had consigned myself to this <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, where I had no companions but scorpions and wild beasts, I often found myself amid bevies of girls. My face was pale and my frame chilled with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; yet my mind was burning with desire, and the fires of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> kept bubbling up before me when my flesh was as good as dead. Helpless, I cast myself at the feet of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, I watered them with my tears, I wiped them with my hair: and then I subdued my rebellious body with weeks of abstinence. I do not blush to avow my abject misery; rather I lament that I am not now what once I was. I remember how I often cried aloud all night till the break of day and ceased not from beating my breast till tranquillity returned at the chiding of the Lord. I used to dread my very cell as though it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> my thoughts; and, stern and <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with myself, I used to make my way alone into the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>. Wherever I saw hollow valleys, craggy mountains, steep cliffs, there I made my oratory, there the house of correction for my unhappy flesh. There, also&mdash; the Lord Himself is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>&mdash; when I had shed copious tears and had strained my eyes towards heaven, I sometimes felt myself among angelic hosts, and for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> sang: <q>because of the savour of your good ointments we will run after you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300392"><a href="../bible/son001.htm#verse3">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;1:3-4</a></span> </p>

<p>8. Now, if such are the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of men who, since their bodies are emaciated with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, have only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thoughts to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, how must it fare with a girl whose surroundings are those of luxury and ease? Surely, to use the apostle's words, <q>She is dead while she lives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300393"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:6</a></span> Therefore, if experience gives me a right to advise, or clothes my words with credit, I would begin by urging you and warning you as Christ's spouse to avoid wine as you would avoid poison. For wine is the first weapon used by <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> against the young. Greed does not shake, nor <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> puff up, nor ambition infatuate so much as this. Other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> we easily escape, but this enemy is shut up within us, and wherever we go we carry him with us. Wine and youth between them kindle the fire of sensual pleasure. Why do we throw oil on the flame&mdash; why do we add fresh fuel to a miserable body which is already ablaze. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, says to Timothy <q>drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and for your frequent infirmities.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300394"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:23</a></span> But notice the reasons for which the permission is given, to cure an aching stomach and a frequent infirmity. And lest we should indulge ourselves too much on the score of our ailments, he commands that but little shall be taken; advising rather as a physician than as an apostle (though, indeed, an apostle is a spiritual physician). He evidently feared that Timothy might succumb to weakness, and might prove unequal to the constant moving to and fro involved in preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Besides, he remembered that he had spoken of <q>wine wherein is excess,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300395"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse18">Ephesians&nbsp;5:18</a></span> and had said, <q>it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300396"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;14:21</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> drank wine and became intoxicated; but living as he did in the rude age after the flood, when the vine was first planted, perhaps he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> its power of inebriation. And to let you see the hidden meaning of Scripture in all its fullness (for the word of God is a pearl and may be pierced on every side) after his <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> came the uncovering of his body; self-indulgence culminated in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300397"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse20">Genesis&nbsp;9:20-21</a></span> First the belly is crammed; then the other members are roused. Similarly, at a later period, <q>The people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300398"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;32:6</a></span> <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> also, God's friend, whom He saved upon the mountain, who was the only one found righteous out of so many thousands, was intoxicated by his daughters. And, although they may have acted as they did more from a desire of offspring than from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of sinful pleasure&mdash; for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> seemed in danger of extinction&mdash; yet they were well aware that the righteous man would not abet their design unless intoxicated. In fact he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what he was doing, and his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was not wilful. Still his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was a grave one, for it made him the father of Moab and Ammon, <span class="stiki" id="note300399"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;19:30-38</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel's</a> enemies, of whom it is said: <q>Even to the fourteenth generation they shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord forever.</q> </p>

<p>9. When Elijah, in his flight from <a href="../cathen/08404a.htm">Jezebel</a>, lay weary and desolate beneath the oak, there came an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> who raised him up and said, <q>Arise and eat.</q> And he looked, and behold there was a cake and a cruse of water at his head. <span class="stiki" id="note300401"><a href="../bible/1ki019.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19:4-6</a></span> Had God willed it, might He not have sent His <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> spiced wines and dainty dishes and flesh basted into tenderness? When Elisha invited the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> to dinner, he only gave them field-herbs to eat; and when all cried out with one voice: <q>There is death in the pot,</q> the man of God did not storm at the cooks (for he was not used to very sumptuous fare), but caused meal to be brought, and casting it in, sweetened the bitter mess <span class="stiki" id="note300402"><a href="../bible/2ki004.htm#verse38">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:38-41</a></span> with spiritual strength as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> had once sweetened the waters of Mara. <span class="stiki" id="note300403"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse23">Exodus&nbsp;15:23-25</a></span> Again, when men were sent to arrest the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, and were smitten with physical and mental blindness, that he might bring them without their own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>, notice the food with which Elisha ordered them to be refreshed. <q>Set bread and water,</q> he said, <q>before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300404"><a href="../bible/2ki006.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;6:18-23</a></span> And Daniel, who might have had rich food from the king's table, <span class="stiki" id="note300405"><a href="../bible/dan001.htm#verse8">Daniel&nbsp;1:8</a></span> preferred the mower's breakfast, brought to him by Habakkuk,  which must have been but country fare. He was called <q>a man of desires,</q>  because he would not eat the bread of desire or drink the wine of concupiscence.</p>

<p>10. There are, in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, countless divine answers condemning <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a> and approving simple food. But as <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> is not my present theme and an adequate discussion of it would require a treatise to itself, these few observations must suffice of the many which the subject suggests. By them you will understand why the first man, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> his belly and not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was cast down from paradise into this vale of tears;  and why <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> used hunger to tempt the Lord Himself in the wilderness; <span class="stiki" id="note300409"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;4:2-3</a></span> and why the apostle cries: <q>Meats for the belly and the belly for meats, but God shall destroy both it and them;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300410"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:13</a></span> and why he speaks of the self-indulgent as men <q>whose God is their belly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300411"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians&nbsp;3:19</a></span> For men invariably worship what they like best. Care must be taken, therefore, that abstinence may bring back to Paradise those whom satiety once drove out.</p>

<p>11. You will tell me, perhaps, that, high-born as you are, reared in luxury and used to lie softly, you cannot do without wine and dainties, and would find a stricter rule of life unendurable. If so, I can only say: <q>Live, then, by your own rule, since God's rule is too hard for you.</q> Not that the Creator and Lord of all takes pleasure in a rumbling and empty stomach, or in fevered lungs; but that these are indispensable as means to the preservation of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Job was dear to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, perfect and upright before Him; <span class="stiki" id="note300412"><a href="../bible/job002.htm#verse3">Job&nbsp;2:3</a></span> yet hear what he says of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>: <q>His strength is in the loins, and his force is in the navel.</q> </p>

<p>The terms are chosen for decency's sake, but the reproductive organs of the two sexes are meant. Thus, the descendant of David, who, according to the promise is to sit upon his throne, is said to come from his loins.  And the seventy-five <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> descended from Jacob who entered <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> are said to come out of his thigh. <span class="stiki" id="note300415"><a href="../bible/gen046.htm#verse26">Genesis&nbsp;46:26</a></span> So, also, when his thigh shrank after the Lord had wrestled with him, <span class="stiki" id="note300416"><a href="../bible/gen032.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;32:24-25</a></span> he ceased to beget children. The <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, again, are told to celebrate the passover with loins girded and mortified. <span class="stiki" id="note300417"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;12:11</a></span> God says to Job: <q>Gird up your loins as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300418"><a href="../bible/job038.htm#verse3">Job&nbsp;38:3</a></span> John wears a leathern girdle. <span class="stiki" id="note300419"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;3:4</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> must gird their loins to carry the lamps of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300420"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse35">Luke&nbsp;12:35</a></span> When Ezekiel tells us how Jerusalem is found in the plain of wandering, covered with blood, he uses the words: <q>Your navel has not been cut.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300421"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse4">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:4-6</a></span> In his assaults on men, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> strength is in the loins; in his attacks on <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> his force is in the navel.</p>

<p>12. Do you wish for <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of my assertions? Take examples. Sampson was braver than a lion and tougher than a rock; alone and unprotected he pursued a thousand armed men; and yet, in Delilah's embrace, his resolution melted away. David was a man after God's own heart, and his lips had often sung of the Holy One, the future Christ; and yet as he walked upon his housetop he was fascinated by Bathsheba's nudity, and added <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> to <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300422"><a href="../bible/2sa011.htm">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;xi</a></span> Notice here how, even in his own house, a man cannot use his eyes without danger. Then repenting, he says to the Lord: <q>Against you, you only, have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> and done this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in Your sight.</q>  Being a king he feared no one else. So, too, with Solomon. Wisdom used him to sing her praise,  and he treated of all plants <q>from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the <a href="../cathen/07612a.htm">hyssop</a> that springs out of the wall;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300425"><a href="../bible/1ki004.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;4:33</a></span> and yet he went back from God because he was a lover of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300426"><a href="../bible/1ki011.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;11:1-4</a></span> And, as if to show that near relationship is no safeguard,  Amnon burned with illicit passion for his sister Tamar. <span class="stiki" id="note300427"><a href="../bible/2sa013.htm">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;xiii</a></span> </p>

<p>13. I cannot bring myself to speak of the many <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who daily fall and are lost to the bosom of the church, their mother: stars over which the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> foe sets up his throne, <span class="stiki" id="note300428"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;14:13</a></span> and rocks hollowed by the serpent that he may dwell in their fissures. You may see many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> before wedded, who try to conceal their miserable fall by a lying garb. Unless they are betrayed by swelling wombs or by the crying of their infants, they walk abroad with tripping feet and heads in the air. Some go so far as to take potions, that they may insure barrenness, and thus <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings almost before their conception. Some, when they find themselves with child through their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, use drugs to procure <a href="../cathen/01046b.htm">abortion</a>, and when (as often happens) they die with their offspring, they enter the lower world laden with the guilt not only of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> against Christ but also of suicide and child <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Yet it is these who say: <q>'Unto the pure all things are pure;' <span class="stiki" id="note300429"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse15">Titus&nbsp;1:15</a></span> my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> is sufficient guide for me. A pure heart is what God looks for. Why should I abstain from meats which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has created to be received with thanksgiving?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300430"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:3</a></span> And when they wish to appear agreeable and entertaining they first drench themselves with wine, and then joining the grossest profanity to intoxication, they say <q>Far be it from me to abstain from the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> And when they see another pale or sad they call her <q>wretch</q> or <q><a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a>;</q>  quite <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a>, indeed, for on their principles <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> involves <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. When they go out they do their best to attract notice, and with nods and winks encourage troops of young fellows to follow them. Of each and all of these the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> words are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: <q>You have a whore's forehead; you refuse to be ashamed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300432"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:3</a></span> Their robes have but a narrow purple stripe,  it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; and their head-dress is somewhat loose, so as to leave the hair free. From their shoulders flutters the lilac mantle which they call <q>ma-forte;</q> they have their feet in cheap slippers and their arms tucked up tight-fitting sleeves. Add to these marks of their profession an easy gait, and you have all the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> that they possess. Such may have eulogizers of their own, and may fetch a higher price in the market of perdition, merely because they are called <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. But to such <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> as these I prefer to be displeasing.</p>

<p>14. I blush to speak of it, it is so shocking; yet though sad, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. How comes this plague of the agapet&aelig;  to be in the church? Whence come these unwedded wives, these novel concubines, these harlots, so I will call them, though they cling to a single partner? One house holds them and one chamber. They often occupy the same bed, and yet they call us suspicious if we fancy anything amiss. A brother leaves his virgin sister; a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, slighting her unmarried brother, seeks a brother in a stranger. Both alike profess to have but one object, to find spiritual consolation from those not of their kin; but their real aim is to indulge in sexual intercourse. It is on such that Solomon in the book of proverbs heaps his scorn. <q>Can a man take fire in his bosom,</q> he says, <q>and his clothes not be burned? Can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300435"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse27">Proverbs&nbsp;6:27-28</a></span> </p>

<p>15. We cast out, then, and banish from our sight those who only wish to seem and not to be <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Henceforward I may bring all my speech to bear upon you who, as it is your lot to be the first virgin of noble birth in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, have to labor the more diligently not to lose <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come, as well as those that are present. You have at least learned from a case in your own <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> the troubles of wedded life and the uncertainties of marriage. Your sister, Bl&aelig;silla, before you in age but behind you in declining the vow of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, has become a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> but seven months after she has taken a husband. Hapless plight of us mortals who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what is before us! She has lost, at once, the crown of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and the pleasures of wedlock. And, although, as a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, the second degree of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is hers, still can you not <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> the continual crosses which she has to bear, daily seeing in her sister what she has lost herself; and, while she finds it hard to go without the pleasures of wedlock, having a less reward for her present continence? Still she, too, may take heart and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. The fruit which is an hundredfold and that which is sixtyfold both spring from one seed, and that seed is <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300436"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;13:8</a></span> </p>

<p>16. Do not court the company of married ladies or visit the houses of the high-born. Do not look too often on the life which you despised to become a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Women of the world, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, plume themselves because their husbands are on the bench or in other high positions. And the wife of the emperor always has an eager throng of visitors at her door. Why do you, then, wrong your husband? Why do you, God's bride, hasten to visit the wife of a mere man? Learn in this respect a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are better than they. And not only must you avoid intercourse with those who are puffed up by their husbands' <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, who are hedged in with troops of eunuchs, and who wear robes inwrought with threads of gold. You must also shun those who are <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> from necessity and not from choice. Not that they ought to have desired the death of their husbands; but that they have not welcomed the opportunity of continence when it has come. As it is, they only change their garb; their old self-seeking remains unchanged. To see them in their capacious litters, with red cloaks and plump bodies, a row of eunuchs walking in front of them, you would fancy them not to have lost husbands but to be seeking them. Their houses are filled with flatterers and with guests. The very <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, who ought to inspire them with respect by their teaching and authority, <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> these ladies on the forehead, and putting forth their hands (so that, if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> no better, you might suppose them in the act of blessing), take wages for their visits. They, meanwhile, seeing that <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> cannot do without them, are lifted up into <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>; and as, having had experience of both, they prefer the license of widowhood to the restraints of marriage, they call themselves chaste livers and <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nuns</a>. After an immoderate supper they retire to rest to dream of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. </p>

<p>17. Let your companions be <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> pale and thin with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, and approved by their years and conduct; such as daily sing in their hearts: <q>Tell me where you feed your flock, where you make it to rest at noon,</q>  and say, with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> earnestness, <q>I have a desire to depart and to be with Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300439"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse23">Philippians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> Be subject to your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, imitating the example of your spouse. <span class="stiki" id="note300440"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse51">Luke&nbsp;2:51</a></span> Rarely go abroad, and if you wish to seek the aid of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> seek it in your own chamber. For you will never need a pretext for going out if you always go out when there is need. Take food in moderation, and never overload your stomach. For many <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, while temperate as regards wine, are intemperate in the use of food. When you rise at night to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, let your breath be that of an empty and not that of an overfull stomach. Read often, learn all that you can. Let sleep overcome you, the roll still in your hands; when your head falls, let it be on the sacred page. Let your <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> be of daily occurrence and your refreshment such as avoids satiety. It is idle to carry an empty stomach if, in two or three days' time, the fast is to be made up for by repletion. When cloyed the mind immediately grows sluggish, and when the ground is watered it puts forth the thorns of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. If ever you feel the outward man sighing for the flower of youth, and if, as you lie on your couch after a meal, you are excited by the alluring train of sensual desires; then seize the shield of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for it alone can quench the fiery darts of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300441"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse16">Ephesians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> <q>They are all adulterers,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; <q>they have made ready their heart like an oven.</q>  But do you keep close to the footsteps of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and, intent upon His words, say: <q>Did not our heart burn within us by the way while Jesus opened to us the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300443"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse32">Luke&nbsp;24:32</a></span> and again: <q>Your word is tried to the uttermost, and your servant loves it.</q>  It is hard for the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to avoid loving something, and our mind must of necessity give way to affection of one kind or another. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the flesh is overcome by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the spirit. Desire is quenched by desire. What is taken from the one increases the other. Therefore, as you lie on your couch, say again and again: <q>By night have I sought Him whom my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> loves.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300445"><a href="../bible/son003.htm#verse1">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;3:1</a></span> <q>Mortify, therefore,</q> says the apostle, <q>your members which are upon the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300446"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> Because he himself did so, he could afterwards say with confidence: <q>I live, yet not I, but Christ, lives in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300447"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span> He who mortifies his members, and feels that he is walking in a vain show,  is not afraid to say: <q>I have become like a bottle in the frost.

By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</q> </p>

<p>18. Be like the grasshopper and make night musical. Nightly wash your bed and water your couch with your tears.  Watch and be like the sparrow alone upon the housetop.  Sing with the spirit, but sing with the understanding also. <span class="stiki" id="note300453"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:15</a></span> And let your song be that of the psalmist: <q>Bless the Lord, O my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and forget not all his benefits; who forgives all your iniquities; who heals all your diseases; who redeems your life from destruction.</q>  Can we, any of us, honestly make his words our own: <q>I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping?</q>  Yet, should we not weep and groan when the serpent invites us, as he invited our first <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, to eat forbidden fruit, and when after expelling us from the paradise of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> he desires to clothe us with mantles of skins such as that which Elijah, on his return to paradise, left behind him on earth? <span class="stiki" id="note300456"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;2:13</a></span> Say to yourself: <q>What have I to do with the pleasures of sense that so soon come to an end?

When God says to Eve, <q>In pain and in sorrow you shall bring forth children,</q> say to yourself, <q>That is a law for a married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, not for me.</q> And when He continues, <q>Your desire shall be to your husband,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300457"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;3:16</a></span> say again: <q>Let her desire be to her husband who has not Christ for her spouse.</q> And when, last of all, He says, <q>You shall surely die,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300458"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;2:17</a></span> once more, say, <q>Marriage indeed must end in death; but the life on which I have resolved is independent of sex. Let those who are wives keep the place and the time that properly belong to them.

<p>19. Some one may say, <q>Do you dare detract from wedlock, which is a state blessed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>?</q> I do not detract from wedlock when I set <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> before it. No one compares a bad thing with a good. Wedded <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> may congratulate themselves that they come next to <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. <q>Be fruitful,</q> God says, <q>and multiply, and replenish the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300459"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> He who desires to replenish the earth may increase and multiply if he will. But the train to which you belong is not on earth, but in heaven. The command to increase and multiply first finds fulfilment after the expulsion from paradise, after the nakedness and the fig-leaves which speak of sexual passion. Let them marry and be given in marriage who eat their bread in the sweat of their brow; whose land brings forth to them thorns and thistles, <span class="stiki" id="note300460"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;3:18-19</a></span> and whose crops are choked with briars. My seed produces fruit a hundredfold.  <q>All men cannot receive God's saying, but they to whom it is given.</q></p>

<p>Some people may be eunuchs from necessity; I am one of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300462"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;19:11-12</a></span> <q>There is a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing. There is a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300463"><a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;3:5</a></span> Now that out of the hard stones of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> God has raised up children unto <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300464"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;3:9</a></span> they begin to be <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> stones rolling upon the earth.</q>  They pass through the whirlwinds of the world, and roll on in God's chariot on rapid wheels.

In paradise Eve was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and it was only after the coats of skins that she began her married life. Now paradise is your home too. Keep therefore your birthright and say: <q>Return unto your rest, O my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q>  To show that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is natural while wedlock only follows guilt, what is born of wedlock is virgin flesh, and it gives back in fruit what in root it has lost. <q>There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a flower shall grow out of his roots.</q>  The rod  is the mother of the Lord&mdash; simple, pure, unsullied; drawing no germ of life from without but fruitful in singleness like God Himself. The flower of the rod is Christ, who says of Himself: <q>I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300470"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse1">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:1</a></span> In another place He is foretold to be <q>a stone cut out of the mountain without hands,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300471"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse45">Daniel&nbsp;2:45</a></span> a figure by which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> signifies that He is to be born a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. For the hands are here a figure of wedlock as in the passage: <q>His left hand is under my head and his right hand does embrace me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300472"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse6">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:6</a></span> It agrees, also, with this interpretation that the unclean animals are led into <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah's</a> ark in pairs, while of the clean an uneven number is taken. <span class="stiki" id="note300473"><a href="../bible/gen007.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;7:2</a></span> Similarly, when <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and Joshua were bidden to remove their shoes because the ground on which they stood was <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,  the command had a mystical meaning. So, too, when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were appointed to preach the gospel they were told to take with them neither shoe nor shoe-latchet;  and when the soldiers came to cast lots for the garments of Jesus <span class="stiki" id="note300476"><a href="../bible/joh019.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;19:23-24</a></span> they found no boots that they could take away. For the Lord could not Himself possess what He had forbidden to His servants.</p>

<p>20. I praise wedlock, I praise marriage, but it is because they give me <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. I gather the rose from the thorns, the gold from the earth, the pearl from the shell. <q>Does the plowman plow all day to sow?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300477"><a href="../bible/isa028.htm#verse24">Isaiah&nbsp;28:24</a></span> Shall he not also enjoy the fruit of his labor? Wedlock is the more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, the more what is born of it is loved. Why, mother, do you grudge your daughter her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>? She has been reared on your milk, she has come from your womb, she has grown up in your bosom. Your watchful affection has kept her a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. Are you <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with her because she chooses to be a king's wife and not a soldier's? She has conferred on you a high privilege; you are now the mother-in-law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>Concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>,</q> says the apostle, <q>I have no commandment of the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300478"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:25</a></span> Why was this? Because his own <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> was due, not to a command, but to his free choice. For they are not to be heard who feign him to have had a wife; for, when he is discussing continence and commending perpetual <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, he uses the words, <q>I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as I myself.</q> And farther on, <q>I say, therefore, to the unmarried and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for them if they abide even as I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300479"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7-8</a></span> And in another place, <q>have we not power to lead about wives even as the rest of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300480"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:5</a></span> Why then has he no commandment from the Lord concerning <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>? Because what is freely offered is worth more than what is extorted by force, and to command <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> would have been to abrogate wedlock. It would have been a hard enactment to compel opposition to nature and to extort from men the angelic life; and not only so, it would have been to condemn what is a divine ordinance.</p>

<p>21. The old law had a different ideal of blessedness, for therein it is said: <q>Blessed is he who has seed in Zion and a <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in Jerusalem:</q>  and <q>Cursed is the barren who bears not:</q>  and <q>Your children shall be like olive-plants round about your table.</q>  Riches too are promised to the faithful and we are told that <q>there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</q>  But now even to eunuchs it is said, <q>Say not, behold I am a dry tree,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300485"><a href="../bible/isa056.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;56:3</a></span> for instead of sons and daughters you have a place forever in heaven. Now the poor are blessed, now Lazarus is set before Dives in his purple.  Now he who is weak is counted strong. But in those days the world was still unpeopled: accordingly, to pass over instances of childlessness meant only to serve as types, those only were considered <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> who could boast of children. It was for this reason that <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> in his old age married Keturah; <span class="stiki" id="note300487"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;25:1</a></span> that Leah hired Jacob with her son's mandrakes, <span class="stiki" id="note300488"><a href="../bible/gen030.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;30:14-16</a></span> and that fair Rachel&mdash; a type of the church&mdash; complained of the closing of her womb. <span class="stiki" id="note300489"><a href="../bible/gen030.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;30:1-2</a></span> But gradually the crop grew up and then the reaper was sent forth with his sickle. Elijah lived a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> life, so also did Elisha and many of the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. To Jeremiah the command came: <q>You shall not take you a wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300490"><a href="../bible/jer016.htm#verse2">Jeremiah&nbsp;16:2</a></span> He had been sanctified in his mother's womb, <span class="stiki" id="note300491"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:5</a></span> and now he was forbidden to take a wife because the captivity was near. The apostle gives the same counsel in different words. <q>I think, therefore, that this is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> by reason of the present distress, namely that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man to be as he is.</q>  What is this distress which does away with the joys of wedlock? The apostle tells us, in a later verse: <q>The time is short: it remains that those who have wives be as though they had none.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300493"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:29</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> is hard at hand. The lion is bestirring himself from his lair. What good will marriage be to me if it is to end in slavery to the haughtiest of kings? What good will little ones be to me if their lot is to be that which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> sadly describes: <q>The tongue of the sucking child cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread and no man breaks it unto them</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note300494"><a href="../bible/lam004.htm#verse4">Lamentations&nbsp;4:4</a></span> In those days, as I have said, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of continence was found only in men: Eve still continued to travail with children. But now that a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> has conceived <span class="stiki" id="note300495"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> in the womb and has borne to us a child of which the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says that <q>Government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called the mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the everlasting Father,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300496"><a href="../bible/isa009.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;9:6</a></span> now the chain of the curse is broken. Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary. And thus the gift of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> has been bestowed most richly upon <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, seeing that it has had its beginning from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. As soon as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> set foot upon the earth, He formed for Himself a new household there; that, as He was adored by <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven, <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> might serve Him also on earth. Then chaste Judith once more cut off the head of Holofernes. <span class="stiki" id="note300497"><a href="../bible/jth013.htm">Judith&nbsp;xiii</a></span> Then Haman&mdash; whose name means iniquity&mdash; was once more burned in fire of his own kindling. <span class="stiki" id="note300498"><a href="../bible/est007.htm#verse10">Esther&nbsp;7:10</a></span> Then James and John forsook father and net and ship and followed the Saviour: neither kinship nor the world's ties, nor the care of their home could hold them back. Then were the words heard: <q>Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300499"><a href="../bible/mar008.htm#verse34">Mark&nbsp;8:34</a></span> For no soldier goes with a wife to battle. Even when a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> would have buried his father, the Lord forbade him, and said: <q>Foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests, but the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> has not where to lay His head.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300500"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;8:20-22</a></span> So you must not complain if you have but scanty house-room. In the same strain, the apostle writes: <q>He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is married cares for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife. There is difference also between a wife and a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. The unmarried <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cares for the things of the Lord that she may be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and in spirit. But she that is married cares for the things of the world how she may please her husband.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300501"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:32-34</a></span> </p>

<p>22. How great inconveniences are involved in wedlock and how many anxieties encompass it I have, I think, described shortly in my treatise&mdash; published against Helvidius &mdash; on the perpetual <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> of the blessed Mary. It would be tedious to go over the same ground now; and any one who pleases may draw from that fountain. But lest I should seem wholly to have passed over the matter, I will just say now that the apostle bids us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing, <span class="stiki" id="note300503"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> and that he who in the married state renders his wife her due  cannot so <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. Either we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> always and are <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, or we cease to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may fulfil the claims of marriage. Still he says: <q>If a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> marry she has not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300505"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:28</a></span> At the outset I promised that I should say little or nothing of the embarrassments of wedlock, and now I give you notice to the same effect. If you want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from how many vexations a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> is free and by how many a wife is fettered you should read <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> <q>to a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> friend,</q>  and his other treatises on <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, the blessed Cyprian's noble volume, the writings of Pope Damasus  in prose and verse, and the treatises recently written for his sister by our own Ambrose.  In these he has poured forth his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with such a flood of eloquence that he has sought out, set forth, and put in order all that bears on the praise of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>.</p>

<p>23. We must proceed by a different path, for our purpose is not the praise of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> but its preservation. To <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is a good thing is not enough: when we have chosen it we must guard it with jealous care. The first only requires judgment, and we share it with many; the second calls for toil, and few compete with us in it. <q>He that shall endure unto the end,</q> the Lord says, <q>the same shall be saved,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300509"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;24:13</a></span> and <q>many are called but few are chosen.</q>  Therefore I conjure you before God and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> and His elect <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> to guard that which you have received, not readily exposing to the public gaze the vessels of the Lord's temple (which only the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are by right allowed to see), that no profane person may look upon God's sanctuary. Uzzah, when he touched the ark which it was not lawful to touch, was struck down suddenly by death. <span class="stiki" id="note300511"><a href="../bible/2sa006.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;6:6-7</a></span> And assuredly no gold or silver vessel was ever so dear to God as is the temple of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> body. The shadow went before, but now the reality has come. You indeed may speak in all simplicity, and from motives of amiability may treat with courtesy the veriest strangers, but unchaste eyes see nothing aright. They fail to appreciate the beauty of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and only value that of the body. Hezekiah showed God's treasure to the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300512"><a href="../bible/2ki020.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;20:12-13</a></span> who ought never to have seen what they were sure to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>. The consequence was that Jud&aelig;a was torn by continual <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and that the very first things carried away to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> were these vessels of the Lord. We find Belshazzar at his feast and among his concubines (<a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> always glories in defiling what is noble) drinking out of these sacred cups. <span class="stiki" id="note300513"><a href="../bible/dan005.htm#verse1">Daniel&nbsp;5:1-3</a></span> </p>

<p>24. Never incline your ear to words of mischief. For men often say an improper word to make trial of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> steadfastness, to see if she hears it with pleasure, and if she is ready to unbend at every silly jest. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> applaud whatever you affirm and deny whatever you deny; they speak of you as not only <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> but accomplished, and say that in you there is no guile. <q>Behold,</q> say they, <q>a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> hand-maid of Christ; behold entire singleness of heart. How different from that rough, unsightly,  countrified fright, who most likely never married because she could never find a husband.</q> Our natural weakness induces us readily to listen to such flatterers; but, though we may blush and reply that such praise is more than our due, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> within us rejoices to hear itself praised.</p>

<p>Like the ark of the covenant Christ's spouse should be overlaid with gold within and without; <span class="stiki" id="note300514"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;25:11</a></span> she should be the guardian of the law of the Lord. Just as the ark contained nothing but the tables of the covenant, <span class="stiki" id="note300515"><a href="../bible/1ki008.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;8:9</a></span> so in you there should be no thought of anything that is outside. For it pleases the Lord to sit in your mind as He once sat on the mercy-seat and the cherubims. <span class="stiki" id="note300516"><a href="../bible/exo025.htm#verse22">Exodus&nbsp;25:22</a></span> As He sent His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to loose Him the foal of an ass that he might ride on it, so He sends them to release you from the cares of the world, that leaving the bricks and straw of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, you may follow Him, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, through the wilderness and may enter the land of promise.

Jesus entering into the temple cast out those things which belonged not to the temple. For God is jealous and will not allow the father's house to be made a den of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>.  Where money is counted, where doves are sold, where simplicity is stifled where, that is, a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin's</a> breast glows with cares of this world; straightway the veil of the temple is rent, <span class="stiki" id="note300520"><a href="../bible/mat027.htm#verse51">Matthew&nbsp;27:51</a></span> the bridegroom rises in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, he says: <q>Your house is left unto you desolate.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300521"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;23:38</a></span> Read the gospel and see how Mary sitting at the feet of the Lord is set before the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> Martha.

<p>Go not from home nor visit the daughters of a strange land, though you have patriarchs for brothers and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> for a father.

Jesus is jealous. He does not choose that your face should be seen of others. You may excuse yourself and say: <q>I have drawn close my veil, I have covered my face and I have sought You there and have said: 'Tell me, O Thou whom my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> loves, where You feed Your flock, where You make it to rest at noon. For why should I be as one that is veiled beside the flocks of Your companions?'</q>  Yet in spite of your excuses He will be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, He will swell with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and say: <q>If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not yourself, O you fairest among <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, go your way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed your goats beside the shepherd's tents.</q>  You may be fair, and of all faces yours may be the dearest to the Bridegroom; yet, unless you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourself, and keep your heart with all diligence, <span class="stiki" id="note300540"><a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse23">Proverbs&nbsp;4:23</a></span> unless also you avoid the eyes of the young men, you will be turned out of My bride-chamber to feed the goats, which shall be set on the left hand. <span class="stiki" id="note300541"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;25:33</a></span> </p>

<p>26. These things being so, my <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, daughter, lady, fellow-servant, sister&mdash; these names refer the first to your age, the second to your rank, the third to your religious vocation, the last to the place which you hold in my affection&mdash; hear the words of Isaiah: <q>Come, my people, enter thou into your chambers, and shut your doors about you: hide yourself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation</q> of the Lord <q>be overpast.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300542"><a href="../bible/isa026.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;26:20</a></span> Let foolish <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> stray abroad, but for your part stay at home with the Bridegroom; for if you shut your door, and, according to the precept of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300543"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;6:6</a></span> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to your Father in secret, He will come and knock, saying: <q>Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if any man...open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300544"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse20">Revelation&nbsp;3:20</a></span> Then straightway you will eagerly reply: <q>It is the voice of my beloved that knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, my dove, my undefiled.</q> It is impossible that you should refuse, and say: <q>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?

Do you too keep your windows open, but only on the side where light may enter and whence you may see the eye of the Lord.

<p>27. You must also be careful to avoid the snare of a passion for vainglory. <q>How,</q> Jesus says, <q>can you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> which receive <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> one from another?</q>  What an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that must be the victim of which cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>! Let us rather say: <q>You are my glorying,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300551"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse24">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:24</a></span> and <q>He that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glories</a>, let him <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300552"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse31">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:31</a></span> and <q>If I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300553"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> and <q>Far be it from me to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> save in the cross of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through whom the world has been crucified unto me and I unto the world;</q>  and once more: <q>In God we boast all the day long; my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall make her boast in the Lord.</q>  When you do <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, let God alone see you. When you fast, be of a cheerful countenance.  Let your dress be neither too neat nor too slovenly; neither let it be so remarkable as to draw the attention of passers-by, and to make men point their fingers at you. Is a brother dead? Has the body of a sister to be carried to its burial? Take care lest in too often performing such offices you die yourself. Do not wish to seem very devout nor more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> than need be, lest you seek <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> by shunning it. For many, who screen from all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> sight their poverty, charity, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, desire to excite admiration by their very disdain of it, and strangely seek for praise while they profess to keep out of its way. From the other disturbing influences which make men <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, despond, hope, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> I find many free; but this is a defect which few are without, and he is best whose character, like a fair skin, is disfigured by the fewest blemishes. I do not think it necessary to warn you against boasting of your riches, or against priding yourself on your birth, or against setting yourself up as superior to others. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your humility; I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you can say with sincerity: <q>Lord, my heart is not <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a> nor my eyes lofty;</q>  I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in your breast as in that of your mother the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> through which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> fell has no place. It would be time wasted to write to you about it; for there is no greater folly than to teach a pupil what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> already. But now that you have despised the boastfulness of the world, do not let the fact inspire you with new boastfulness. Harbor not the secret thought that having ceased to court attention in garments of gold you may begin to do so in mean attire. And when you come into a room full of brothers and sisters, do not sit in too low a place or plead that you are unworthy of a footstool. Do not deliberately lower your voice as though worn out with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; nor, leaning on the shoulder of another, mimic the tottering gait of one who is faint. Some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. <span class="stiki" id="note300558"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;6:16</a></span> As soon as they catch sight of any one they groan, they look down; they cover up their faces, all but one eye, which they keep free to see with. Their dress is sombre, their girdles are of sackcloth, their hands and feet are dirty; only their stomachs&mdash; which cannot be seen&mdash; are hot with food. Of these the psalm is sung daily: <q>The Lord will scatter the bones of them that please themselves.</q>  Others change their garb and assume the mien of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, being ashamed of being what they were born to be&mdash; <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. They cut off their hair and are not ashamed to look like eunuchs. Some clothe themselves in goat's hair, and, putting on hoods, think to become children again by making themselves look like so many owls. </p>

<p>28. But I will not speak only of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>. Avoid men, also, when you see them loaded with chains and wearing their hair long like <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, contrary to the apostle's precept, <span class="stiki" id="note300561"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:14</a></span> not to speak of beards like those of goats, black cloaks, and bare feet braving the cold. All these things are tokens of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Such an one Rome groaned over some time back in Antimus; and Sophronius is a still more recent instance. Such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, when they have once gained admission to the houses of the high-born, and have deceived <q>silly <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> laden with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, ever learning and never able to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300562"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:6-7</a></span> feign a sad mien and pretend to make long <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> while at night they feast in secret. Shame forbids me to say more, for my language might appear more like invective than admonition. There are others&mdash; I speak of those of my own order&mdash; who seek the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a> and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">diaconate</a> simply that they may be able to see <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with less restraint. Such men think of nothing but their dress; they use perfumes freely, and see that there are no creases in their leather shoes. Their curling hair shows traces of the tongs; their fingers glisten with rings; they walk on tiptoe across a damp road, not to splash their feet. When you see men acting in this way, think of them rather as bridegrooms than as clergymen. Certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have devoted the whole of their energies and life to the single object of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the names, houses, and characters of married ladies. I will here briefly describe the head of the profession, that from the master's likeness you may recognize the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. He rises and goes forth with the sun; he has the order of his visits duly arranged; he takes the shortest road; and, troublesome old man that he is, forces his way almost into the bedchambers of ladies yet asleep. If he sees a pillow that takes his fancy or an elegant table-cover&mdash; or indeed any article of household furniture&mdash; he praises it, looks admiringly at it, takes it into his hand, and, complaining that he has nothing of the kind, begs or rather extorts it from the owner. All the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, in fact, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to cross the news-carrier of the town. Chastity and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> are alike distasteful to him. What he likes is a savory breakfast&mdash; say off a plump young crane such as is commonly called a cheeper. In speech he is rude and forward, and is always ready to bandy reproaches. Wherever you turn he is the first man that you see before you. Whatever news is noised abroad he is either the originator of the rumor or its magnifier. He changes his horses every hour; and they are so sleek and spirited that you would take him for a brother of the Thracian king. </p>

<p>29. Many are the stratagems which the wily enemy employs against us. <q>The serpent,</q> we are told, <q>was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300564"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;3:1</a></span> And the apostle says: <q>We are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his devices.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300565"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> Neither an affected shabbiness nor a stylish smartness becomes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. If there is anything of which you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, if you have any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about Scripture, ask one whose life commends him, whose age puts him above suspicion, whose <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> does not belie him; one who may be able to say: <q>I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a chaste virgin to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> Or if there should be none such able to explain, it is better to avoid danger at the price of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> than to court it for the sake of learning. Remember that you walk in the midst of snares, and that many veteran <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, of a <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> never called in question, have, on the very threshold of death, let their crowns fall from their hands.</p>

<p>If any of your handmaids share your vocation, do not lift up yourself against them or <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> yourself because you are their mistress. You have all chosen one Bridegroom; you all sing the same psalms; together you receive the Body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Why then should your thoughts be different?  You must try to win others, and that you may attract the more readily you must treat the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> in your train with the greatest respect. If you find one of them weak in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, be attentive to her, comfort her, caress her, and make her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> your treasure. But if a girl pretends to have a vocation simply because she desires to escape from service, read aloud to her the words of the apostle: <q>It is better to marry than to burn.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300567"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:9</a></span> </p>

<p>Idle <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> and busybodies, whether <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> or <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>; such as go from house to house calling on married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and displaying an unblushing effrontery greater than that of a stage parasite, cast from you as you would the plague. For <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications corrupt good manners,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300568"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse33">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:33</a></span> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> like these care for nothing but their lowest appetites. They will often urge you, saying, <q>My dear creature, make the best of your advantages, and live while life is yours,</q> and <q>Surely you are not laying up money for your children.</q> Given to wine and wantonness, they instill all manner of mischief into people's minds, and induce even the most austere to indulge in enervating pleasures. And <q>when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ they will marry, having condemnation because they have rejected their first <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300569"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:11-12</a></span> </p>

<p>Do not seek to appear over-eloquent, nor trifle with verse, nor make yourself gay with lyric songs. And do not, out of affectation, follow the sickly taste  of married ladies who, now pressing their teeth together, now keeping their lips wide apart, speak with a lisp, and purposely clip their words, because they fancy that to pronounce them naturally is a mark of country breeding. Accordingly they find pleasure in what I may call an <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> of the tongue. For <q>what communion has light with darkness?

<p>30. Many years ago, when for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven's</a> sake I had cut myself off from home, <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, sister, relations, and&mdash; harder still&mdash; from the dainty food to which I had been accustomed; and when I was on my way to Jerusalem to wage my warfare, I still could not bring myself to forego the <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> which I had formed for myself at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> with great care and toil. And so, miserable man that I was, I would fast only that I might afterwards read Cicero. After many nights spent in vigil, after floods of tears called from my inmost heart, after the recollection of my past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I would once more take up Plautus. And when at times I returned to my right <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and began to read the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, their style seemed rude and repellent. I failed to see the light with my blinded eyes; but I attributed the fault not to them, but to the sun. While the old serpent was thus making me his plaything, about the middle of Lent a deep-seated fever fell upon my weakened body, and while it destroyed my rest completely&mdash; the story seems hardly credible&mdash; it so wasted my unhappy frame that scarcely anything was left of me but skin and bone. Meantime preparations for my funeral went on; my body grew gradually colder, and the warmth of life lingered only in my throbbing breast. Suddenly I was caught up in the spirit and dragged before the judgment seat of the Judge; and here the light was so bright, and those who stood around were so radiant, that I cast myself upon the ground and did not dare to look up. Asked who and what I was I replied: <q>I am a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</q> But He who presided said: <q>Thou liest, you are a follower of Cicero and not of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For 'where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300577"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;6:21</a></span> Instantly I became dumb, and amid the strokes of the lash&mdash; for He had ordered me to be scourged&mdash; I was tortured more severely still by the fire of <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, considering with myself that verse, <q>In the grave who shall give you thanks?</q>  Yet for all that I began to cry and to bewail myself, saying: <q>Have mercy upon me, O Lord: have mercy upon me.</q> Amid the sound of the scourges this cry still made itself heard. At last the bystanders, falling down before the knees of Him who presided, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that He would have pity on my youth, and that He would give me space to repent of my <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. He might still, they urged, inflict torture on me, should I ever again read the works of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Under the stress of that awful moment I should have been ready to make even still larger promises than these. Accordingly I made <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and called upon His name, saying: <q>Lord, if ever again I possess worldly books, or if ever again I read such, I have denied You.</q> Dismissed, then, on taking this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, I returned to the upper world, and, to the surprise of all, I opened upon them eyes so drenched with tears that my distress served to convince even the incredulous. And that this was no sleep nor idle dream, such as those by which we are often mocked, I call to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> the tribunal before which I lay, and the terrible judgment which I feared. May it never, hereafter, be my lot to fall under such an inquisition! I profess that my shoulders were black and blue, that I felt the bruises long after I awoke from my sleep, and that thenceforth I read the books of God with a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> greater than I had previously given to the books of men.</p>

<p>31. You must also avoid the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, and this not merely by refusing to seize upon what belongs to others, for that is punished by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the state, but also by not keeping your own property, which has now become no longer yours. <q>If have not been faithful,</q> the Lord says, <q>in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300579"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;16:12</a></span> <q>That which is another man's</q> is a quantity of gold or of silver, while <q>that which is our own</q> is the spiritual heritage of which it is elsewhere said: <q>The ransom of a man's life is his riches.</q>  <q>No man can serve two masters, for either he will <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the one and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the other; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">Mammon</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300581"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> Riches, that is; for in the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> tongue of the Syrians riches are called <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>.

<p>But you will say: <q>I am a girl delicately reared, and I cannot labor with my hands. Suppose that I live to old age and then fall sick, who will take pity on me?</q> Hear Jesus speaking to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>: <q>Take no thought what you shall eat; nor yet for your body what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300585"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;6:25-26</a></span> Should clothing fail you, set the lilies before your eyes. Should hunger seize you, think of the words in which the poor and hungry are blessed.

Let the words be ever on your lips: <q>Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return there;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300588"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job&nbsp;1:21</a></span> and <q>We brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300589"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:7</a></span> </p>

<p>32. Today you may see <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> cramming their wardrobes with dresses, changing their gowns from day to day, and for all that unable to vanquish the moths. Now and then one more scrupulous wears out a single dress; yet, while she appears in rags, her boxes are full. Parchments are dyed purple, gold is melted into lettering, manuscripts are decked with jewels, while Christ lies at the door naked and dying. When they hold out a hand to the needy they sound a trumpet; <span class="stiki" id="note300590"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;6:2</a></span> when they invite to a <a href="../cathen/01200b.htm">love-feast</a>  they engage a crier. I lately saw the noblest lady in Rome&mdash; I suppress her name, for I am no satirist&mdash; with a band of eunuchs before her in the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of the blessed Peter. She was giving money to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, a coin apiece; and this with her own hand, that she might be accounted more religious. Hereupon a by no means uncommon incident occurred. An old <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <q>full of years and rags,</q>  ran forward to get a second coin, but when her turn came she received not a penny but a blow hard enough to draw blood from her guilty veins.</p>

<p><q>The <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">love of money</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300593"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:10</a></span> and the apostle speaks of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> as being <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300594"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span> <q>Seek ye first the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and all these things shall be added unto you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300595"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;6:33</a></span> The Lord will never allow a righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to perish of hunger. <q>I have been young,</q> the psalmist says, <q>and now am old, yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread.</q>  Elijah is fed by ministering ravens. <span class="stiki" id="note300597"><a href="../bible/1ki017.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;17:4,&nbsp;6</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> of Zarephath, who with her sons expected to die the same night, went without food herself that she might feed the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>.

<p>33. As I have been led to touch to the subject&mdash; it shall have a treatise to itself if Christ permit&mdash; I will relate what took place not very many years ago at Nitria. A brother, more thrifty than <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the Lord had been sold for thirty pieces of silver, <span class="stiki" id="note300604"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;26:15</a></span> left behind him at his death a hundred pieces of money which he had earned by weaving linen. As there were about five thousand <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in the neighborhood, living in as many separate cells, a council was held as to what should be done. Some said that the coins should be distributed among the poor; others that they should be given to the church, while others were for sending them back to the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> of the deceased. However, Macarius, Pambo, Isidore and the rest of those called fathers, speaking by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, decided that they should be interred with their owner, with the words: <q>Your money perish with you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300605"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse20">Acts&nbsp;8:20</a></span> Nor was this too harsh a decision; for so great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> has fallen upon all throughout <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, that it is now a crime to leave after one a single shilling.</p>

<p>34. As I have mentioned the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you like to hear about <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things, lend an ear to me for a few moments. There are in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> three classes of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. First, there are the c&oelig;nobites,  called in their Gentile language Sauses,  or, as we should say, men living in a community.  Secondly, there are the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>,  who live in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, each man by himself, and are so called because they have withdrawn from <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> society. Thirdly, there is the class called Remoboth,  a very inferior and little regarded type, peculiar to my own province,  or, at least, originating there. These live together in twos and threes, but seldom in larger numbers, and are bound by no rule; but do exactly as they choose. A portion of their earnings they contribute to a common fund, out of which food is provided for all. In most cases they reside in cities and strongholds; and, as though it were their workmanship which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and not their life, all that they sell is extremely dear. They often quarrel because they are unwilling, while supplying their own food, to be subordinate to others. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that they compete with each other in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>; they make what should be a private concern an occasion for a triumph. In everything they study effect: their sleeves are loose, their boots bulge, their garb is of the coarsest. They are always sighing, or visiting <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, or sneering at the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>; yet when a holiday comes, they make themselves sick&mdash; they eat so much.</p>

<p>35. Having then rid ourselves of these as of so many plagues, let us come to that more numerous class who live together, and who are, as we have said, called C&oelig;nobites. Among these the first principle of union is to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> superiors and to do whatever they command. They are divided into bodies of ten and of a hundred, so that each tenth man has authority over nine others, while the hundredth has ten of these officers under him. They live apart from each other, in separate cells. According to their rule, no <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> may visit another before the ninth hour;  except the deans  above mentioned, whose office is to comfort, with soothing words, those whose thoughts disquiet them. After the ninth hour they meet together to sing psalms and read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> according to usage. Then when the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> have ended and all have sat down, one called the father stands up among them and begins to expound the portion of the day. While he is speaking the silence is profound; no man ventures to look at his neighbor or to clear his throat. The speaker's praise is in the weeping of his hearers.  Silent tears roll down their cheeks, but not a sob escapes from their lips. Yet when he begins to speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> kingdom, and of future bliss, and of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is to come, every one may be noticed saying to himself, with a gentle sigh and uplifted eyes: <q>Oh, that I had wings like a dove! For then would I fly away and be at rest.</q>  After this the meeting breaks up and each company of ten goes with its father to its own table. This they take in turns to serve each for a week at a time. No noise is made over the food; no one talks while eating. Bread, pulse and greens form their fare, and the only seasoning that they use is <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>. Wine is given only to the old, who with the children often have a special meal prepared for them to repair the ravages of age and to save the young from premature decay. When the meal is over they all rise together, and, after singing a hymn, return to their dwellings. There each one talks till evening with his comrade thus: <q>Have you noticed so-and-so? What <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> he has! How silent he is! How soberly he walks!</q> If any one is weak they comfort him; or if he is fervent in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they encourage him to fresh earnestness. And because at night, besides the public <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, each man keeps vigil in his own chamber, they go round all the cells one by one, and putting their ears to the doors, carefully ascertain what their occupants are doing. If they find a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a>, they do not scold him; but, dissembling what they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, they visit him more frequently, and at first exhort rather than compel him to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> more. Each day has its allotted task, and this being given in to the dean, is by him brought to the steward. This latter, once a month, gives a scrupulous account to their common father. He also tastes the dishes when they are cooked, and, as no one is allowed to say, <q>I am without a tunic or a cloak or a couch of rushes,</q> he so arranges that no one need ask for or go without what he wants. In case a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> falls ill, he is moved to a more spacious chamber, and there so attentively nursed by the old men, that he misses neither the luxury of cities nor a mother's kindness. Every Lord's day they spend their whole time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and reading; indeed, when they have finished their tasks, these are their usual occupations. Every day they learn by heart a portion of Scripture. They keep the same <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> all the year round, but in Lent they are allowed to live more strictly. After Whitsuntide they exchange their evening meal for a midday one; both to satisfy the tradition of the church and to avoid overloading their stomachs with a double supply of food.</p>

<p>A similar description is given of the <a href="../cathen/05546a.htm">Essenes</a> by <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>,  <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> imitator; also by <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>,  the Greek Livy, in his narrative of the Jewish captivity.</p>

<p>36. As my present subject is <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, I have said rather too much about <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. I will pass on, therefore, to the third class, called <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a>, who go from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> into the deserts, with nothing but bread and <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>  introduced this way of life; Antony made it famous, and&mdash; to go farther back still&mdash; John the Baptist set the first example of it. The <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah describes one such in the words: <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. He sits alone and keeps silence, because he has borne it upon him. He gives his cheek to him that smites him, he is filled full with reproach. For the Lord will not cast off forever.</q>  The struggle of the <a href="../cathen/01462b.htm">anchorites</a> and their life&mdash; in the flesh, yet not of the flesh&mdash; I will, if you wish, explain to you at some other time. I must now return to the subject of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which I left to speak of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. With them before your eyes you will despise, not only gold and silver in general, but earth itself and heaven. United to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you will sing, <q>The Lord is my portion.</q> </p>

<p>37. Farther, although the apostle bids us to <q><a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300621"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> and although to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> their very sleep is a supplication, we ought to have fixed hours of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that if we are detained by work, the time may remind us of our duty. Prayers, as every one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, ought to be said at the third, sixth and ninth hours, at dawn and at evening.  No meal should be begun without <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and before leaving table thanks should be returned to the Creator. We should rise two or three times in the night, and go over the parts of Scripture which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by heart. When we leave the roof which shelters us, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> should be our armor; and when we return from the street we should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> before we sit down, and not give the frail body rest until the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is fed. In every act we do, in every step we take, let our hand trace the Lord's cross. Speak against nobody, and do not <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> your mother's son.  <q>Who are you that judgest the servant of another? To his own lord he stands or falls; yea, he shall be made to stand, for the Lord has power to make him stand.</q>  If you have fasted two or three days, do not think yourself better than others who do not fast. You fast and are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>; another eats and wears a smiling face. You work off your irritation and hunger in quarrels. He uses food in moderation and gives God thanks.  Daily Isaiah cries: <q>Is it such a fast that I have chosen, says the Lord?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300626"><a href="../bible/isa058.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;58:5</a></span> and again: <q>In the day of your fast ye find your own pleasure, and oppress all your laborers. Behold ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. How fast ye unto me?</q>  What kind of fast can his be whose <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> is such that not only does the night go down upon it, but that even the moon's changes leave it unchanged?</p>

<p>38. Look to yourself and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in your own success and not in others' failure. Some <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> care for the flesh and reckon up their income and daily expenditure: such are no fit models for you. Judas was a traitor, but the eleven <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> did not waver. Phygellus and Alexander made shipwreck; but the rest continued to run the race of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  Say not: <q>So-and-so enjoys her own property, she is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, her brothers and sisters come to see her. Has she then ceased to be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>?</q> In the first place, it is doubtful if she is a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>. For <q>the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks upon the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300629"><a href="../bible/1sa016.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;16:7</a></span> Again, she may be a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> in body and not in spirit. According to the apostle, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> virgin is <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and in spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300630"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse34">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:34</a></span> Lastly, let her <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in her own way. Let her override <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> opinion and live in the enjoyment of her <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. But you and I must follow better examples.</p>

<p>Set before you the blessed Mary, whose surpassing purity made her meet to be the mother of the Lord. When the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> Gabriel came down to her, in the form of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and said: <q>Hail, you that are highly favored; the Lord is with you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300631"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;1:28</a></span> she was terror-stricken and unable to reply, for she had never been saluted by a man before. But, on learning who he was, she spoke, and one who had been afraid of a man conversed fearlessly with an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. Now you, too, may be the Lord's mother. <q>Take you a great roll and write in it with a man's pen Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</q>  And when you have gone to the prophetess, and have conceived in the womb, and have brought forth a son,  say: <q>Lord, we have been with child by your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, we have been in pain, we have brought forth the spirit of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which we have wrought upon the earth.</q>  Then shall your Son reply: <q>Behold my mother and my brethren.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300635"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse49">Matthew&nbsp;12:49</a></span> And He whose name you have so recently inscribed upon the table of your heart, and have written with a pen upon its renewed surface &mdash; He, after He has recovered the spoil from the enemy, and has spoiled principalities and powers, nailing them to His cross <span class="stiki" id="note300637"><a href="../bible/col002.htm#verse14">Colossians&nbsp;2:14-15</a></span> &mdash; having been miraculously conceived, grows up to manhood; and, as He becomes older, regards you no longer as His mother, but as His bride. To be as the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, or as the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, or as Christ, involves a hard struggle, but brings with it a great reward.</p>

<p>All such efforts are only of use when they are made within the church's pale;  we must celebrate the passover in the one house, <span class="stiki" id="note300639"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse46">Exodus&nbsp;12:46</a></span> we must enter the ark with <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300640"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:20-21</a></span> we must take refuge from the fall of <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> with the justified harlot, Rahab. <span class="stiki" id="note300641"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse25">James&nbsp;2:25</a></span> Such <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> as there are said to be among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and among the followers of the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> Manes  must be considered, not <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, but prostitutes. For if&mdash; as they allege&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the author of the body, how can they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> that which is fashioned by their foe? No; it is because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the name virgin brings <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> with it, that they go about as wolves in sheep's clothing. <span class="stiki" id="note300643"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> As antichrist pretends to be Christ, such <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> assume an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> name, that they may the better cloak a discreditable life. Rejoice, my sister; <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, my daughter; <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, my virgin; for you have resolved to be, in reality, that which others insincerely feign.</p>

<p>39. The things that I have here set forth will seem hard to her who loves not Christ. But one who has come to regard all the splendor of the world as off-scourings, and to hold all things under the sun as vain, that he may win Christ; <span class="stiki" id="note300644"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;3:8</a></span> one who has died with his Lord and risen again, and has crucified the flesh with its affections and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>;  he will boldly cry out: <q>Who shall separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</q> and again: <q>I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, nor principalities nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, our Lord.</q> </p>

<p>For our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is made the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>.  Nine months He awaits His birth in the womb, undergoes the most revolting conditions,  and comes forth covered with blood, to be swathed in rags and covered with caresses. He who shuts up the world in His fist  is contained in the narrow limits of a <a href="../cathen/04488c.htm">manger</a>. I say nothing of the thirty years during which he lives in obscurity, satisfied with the poverty of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300650"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse51">Luke&nbsp;2:51-52</a></span> When He is scourged He holds His peace; when He is crucified, He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> for His crucifiers. <q>What shall I render unto the Lord for all His benefits towards me? I will take the cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and call upon the name of the Lord. Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</q>  The only fitting return that we can make to Him is to give blood for blood; and, as we are redeemed by the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, gladly to lay down our lives for our Redeemer. What saint has ever won his crown without first contending for it? Righteous Abel is murdered. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is in danger of losing his wife. And, as I must not enlarge my book unduly, seek for yourself: you will find that all <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men have suffered adversity. Solomon alone lived in luxury and perhaps it was for this reason that he fell. For <q>whom the Lord loves, He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300652"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6</a></span> Which is best&mdash; for a short time to do battle, to carry stakes for the palisades, to bear arms, to faint under heavy bucklers, that ever afterwards we may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as victors? Or to become slaves forever, just because we cannot endure for a single hour? </p>

<p>40. Love finds nothing hard; no task is difficult to the eager. Think of all that Jacob bore for Rachel, the wife who had been promised to him. <q>Jacob,</q> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>served seven years for Rachel. And they seemed unto him but a few days for the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he had to her.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300654"><a href="../bible/gen029.htm#verse20">Genesis&nbsp;29:20</a></span> Afterwards he himself tells us what he had to undergo. <q>In the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300655"><a href="../bible/gen031.htm#verse40">Genesis&nbsp;31:40</a></span> So we must <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> Christ and always seek His embraces. Then everything difficult will seem easy; all things long we shall account short; and smitten with His arrows,  we shall say every moment: <q>Woe is me that I have prolonged my pilgrimage.</q>  For <q>the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300658"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;8:18</a></span> For <q>tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope makes not ashamed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300659"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;5:3-5</a></span> When your lot seems hard to bear read <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> second epistle to the Corinthians: <q>In labors more abundant; in stripes above measure; in prisons more frequent; in deaths oft. Of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> five times received I forty stripes save one; thrice was I beaten with rods; once was I <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>; thrice I suffered shipwreck; a night and a day I have been in the deep; in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, in perils by my own countrymen, in perils by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren, in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> often, in cold and nakedness.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300660"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse23">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:23-27</a></span> Which of us can claim the veriest fraction of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> here enumerated? Yet it was these which afterwards made him bold to say: <q>I have finished my course, I have kept the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300661"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:7-8</a></span> </p>

<p>But we, if our food is less appetizing than usual, get sullen, and fancy that we do God a favor by drinking watered wine. And if the water brought to us is a trifle too warm, we break the cup and overturn the table and scourge the servant in fault until blood comes. <q>The <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> suffers <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and the violent take it by force.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300662"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;11:12</a></span> Still, unless you use force you will never seize the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Unless you knock importunately you will never receive the sacramental bread. <span class="stiki" id="note300663"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;11:5-8</a></span> Is it not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, think you, when the flesh desires to be as God and ascends to the place whence <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> have fallen <span class="stiki" id="note300664"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse12">Isaiah&nbsp;14:12-13</a></span> to judge <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>?</p>

<p>41. Emerge, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, for a while from your prison-house, and paint before your eyes the reward of your present toil, a reward which <q>eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300665"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:9</a></span> What will be the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of that day when Mary, the mother of the Lord, shall come to meet you, accompanied by her virgin choirs! When, the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> past and <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> drowned with his host, Miriam, <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron's</a> sister, her timbrel in her hand, shall chant to the answering <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>: <q>Sing ye unto the Lord, for he has triumphed <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a>; the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300666"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse20">Exodus&nbsp;15:20-21</a></span> Then shall Thecla  fly with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to embrace you. Then shall your Spouse himself come forward and say: <q>Rise up, my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, my fair one, and come away, for lo!

The one will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in having borne, the other will exult in having taught you. Then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> will the Lord ride upon his ass,  and thus enter the heavenly Jerusalem. Then the little ones (of whom, in Isaiah, the Saviour says: <q>Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300673"><a href="../bible/isa008.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;8:18</a></span>) shall lift up palms of victory and shall sing with one voice: <q><a href="../cathen/07472b.htm">Hosanna</a> in the highest, blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord, hosanna in the highest.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300674"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;21:9</a></span> Then shall the <q>hundred and forty and four thousand</q> hold their harps before the throne and before the elders and shall sing the new song.
