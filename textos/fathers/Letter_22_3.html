<h1>Letter 22</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">St. Ambrose in a letter to his sister gives an account of the finding of the bodies of SS. Gervasius and Protasius, and of his addresses to the people on that occasion. Preaching from <a href="../bible/psa018.htm">Psalm xix.</a>, he allegorically expounded the <q>heavens</q> to represent the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and the <q>day</q> he takes to be their confession. They were humbled by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and then raised again. He then gives an account of the state in which their bodies were found, and of their translation to the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>. In another address he speaks of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> who denied the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> that were being wrought, as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> used to do, and points out that their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is quite different from that of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and that since the devils acknowledge the Trinity, and they do not, they are worse than the very devils themselves.</span> </p>

<p>To the lady, his sister, dearer to him than his eyes and life, Ambrose Bishop.</p>

<p>1. As I do not wish anything which takes place here in your absence to escape the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that we have found some bodies of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. For after I had dedicated the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>,  many, as it were, with one mouth began to address me, and said: Consecrate this as you did the Roman <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a>. And I answered: <q>Certainly I will if I find any relics of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</q> And at once a kind of prophetic ardour seemed to enter my heart.</p>

<p>2. Why should I use many words? God favoured us, for even the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> were afraid who were bidden to clear away the earth from the spot before the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a> screen of SS. Felix and Nabor. I found the fitting signs, and on bringing in some on whom hands were to be laid,  the power of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> became so manifest, that even while I was still silent, one  was seized and thrown prostrate at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> burial-place. We found two men of marvellous stature, such as those of ancient days. All the bones were perfect, and there was much blood. During the whole of those two days there was an enormous concourse of people. Briefly we arranged the whole in order, and as evening was now coming on transferred them to the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> of Fausta,  where watch was kept during the night, and some received the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>. On the following day we translated the relics to the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> called Ambrosian. During the translation a blind man was healed.  I addressed the people then as follows:</p>

<p>3. When I considered the immense and unprecedented numbers of you who are here gathered together, and the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> which have shone forth in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, I must confess that I felt myself unequal to this task, and that I could not express in words what we can scarcely conceive in our minds or take in with our eyes. But when the course of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture began to be read, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> Who spoke in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> granted me to utter something worthy of so great a gathering, of your expectations, and of the merits of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</p>

<p>4. <q>The heavens,</q> it is said, <q>declare the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  When this Psalm is read, it occurs to one that not so much the material elements as the heavenly merits seem to offer praise worthy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And by the chance of this day's lessons it is made clear what <q>heavens</q> declare the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Look at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> relics at my right hand and at my left, see men of heavenly conversation, behold the trophies of a heavenly mind. These are the heavens which declare the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, these are His handiwork which the firmament proclaims. For not worldly enticements, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the divine working, raised them to the firmament of the most sacred Passion, and long before by the testimony of their character and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> bore <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of them, that they continued steadfast against the dangers of this world.</p>

<p>5. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was a heaven, when he said: <q>Our conversation is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343528"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse20">Philippians&nbsp;3:20</a></span> James and John were heavens, and then were called <q>sons of thunder</q>; <span class="stiki" id="note343529"><a href="../bible/mar003.htm#verse17">Mark&nbsp;3:17</a></span> and John, being as it were a heaven, saw the Word with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note343530"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span> The Lord Jesus Himself was a heaven of perpetual light, when He was declaring the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which no man had seen before. And therefore He said: <q>No man has seen God at any time, except the only-begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He has declared Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343531"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;1:17-18</a></span> If you seek for the handiwork of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, listen to Job when he says: <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> Who has made me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343532"><a href="../bible/job033.htm#verse4">Job&nbsp;33:4</a></span> And so strengthened against the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, he kept his footsteps constantly without offense. But let us go on to what follows.</p>

<p>6. <q>Day,</q> it is said, <q>unto day utters speech.</q>  Behold the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> days, where no darkness of night intervenes. Behold the days full of life and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> brightness, which uttered the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not in speech which passes away, but in their inmost heart, by constancy in confession, and perseverance in their <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>.</p>

<p>7. Another Psalm which was read says: <q>Who is like the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who dwells on high, and regards lowly things in heaven and in the earth?</q>  The Lord regarded indeed lowly things when He revealed to His Church the relics of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> lying hidden under the unnoted turf, whose <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were in heaven, their bodies in the earth: <q>raising the poor out of the dust, and lifting the needy from the mire,</q>  and you see how He has <q>set them with the princes of His people.</q>  Whom are we to esteem as the princes of the people but the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>? Among whose number Protasius and Gervasius long unknown are now enrolled, who have caused the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Milan, barren of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> hitherto, now as the mother of many children, to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the distinctions and instances of her own sufferings.</p>

<p>8. Nor let this seem at variance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: <q>Day unto day utters the word;</q> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> unto <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, life unto life, resurrection unto resurrection; <q>and night unto night shows <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>;</q>  that is, flesh unto flesh, they, that is, whose passion has shown to all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Good are these nights, bright nights, not without stars: <q>For as star differs from star in brightness, so too is the resurrection of the dead.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343538"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse41">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:41</a></span> </p>

<p>9. For not without reason do many call this the resurrection of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. I do not say whether they have risen for themselves, for us certainly the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> have risen. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>&mdash; nay, you have yourselves seen&mdash; that many are cleansed from <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a>, that very many also, having touched with their hands the robe of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, are freed from those ailments which oppressed them; you see that the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of old time are renewed, when through the coming of the Lord Jesus <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> was more largely shed forth upon the earth, and that many bodies are healed as it were by the shadow of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> bodies. How many napkins are passed about! How many garments, laid upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> relics and endowed with healing power, are claimed! All are glad to touch even the outside thread, and whosoever touches will be made whole.</p>

<p>10. Thanks be to You, Lord Jesus, that at this time You have stirred up for us the spirits of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, when Your Church needs greater protection.  Let all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what sort of champions I desire, who are able to defend, but desire not to attack. These have I gained for you, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people, such as may help all and injure none. Such defenders do I desire, such are the soldiers I have, that is, not soldiers of this world, but soldiers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> no ill-will on account of them, the more powerful their patronage is the greater safety is there in it. And I wish for their protection for those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who grudge them to me. Let them come, then, and see my attendants. I do not deny that I am surrounded by such arms: <q>Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will boast in the Name of the Lord our God.</q> </p>

<p>11. The course of <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> relates that Elisha, when surrounded by the army of the Syrians, told his servant, who was afraid, not to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; <q>for,</q> said he, <q>they that be for us are more than those against us;</q>  and in order to prove this, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the eyes of Gehazi might be opened, and when they were opened, he saw that numberless hosts of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> were present. And we, though we cannot see them, yet feel their presence. Our eyes were shut, so long as the bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> lay hidden. The Lord opened our eyes, and we saw the aids wherewith we have been often protected. We used not to see them, but yet we had them. And so, as though the Lord had said to us when trembling, <q>See what great <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> I have given you,</q> so we with opened eyes behold the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, which is passed in the passion of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and present in their working. We have escaped, brethren, no slight lead of shame; we had patrons and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not. We have found this one thing, in which we seem to excel those who have gone before us. That <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, which they lost, we have regained.</p>

<p>12. The <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> relics are taken out of an ignoble burying-place, the trophies are displayed under heaven. The tomb is wet with blood. The marks of the bloody triumph are present, the relics are found undisturbed in their order, the head separated from the body. Old men now repeat that they once heard the names of these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and read their titles. The city which had carried off the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of other places had lost her own. Though this be the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet I cannot deny the favour which the Lord Jesus has granted to the time of my <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and since I myself am not worthy to be a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, I have obtained these <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> for you.</p>

<p>13. Let these triumphant victims be brought to the place where Christ is the victim. But He upon the altar, Who suffered for all; they beneath the altar, who were redeemed by His Passion. I had destined this place for myself, for it is fitting that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> should rest there where he has been wont to offer, but I yield the right hand portion to the sacred victims; that place was due to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Let us, then, deposit the sacred relics, and lay them up in a worthy resting-place, and let us celebrate the whole day with faithful devotion.</p>

<p>14. The people called out and demanded that the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> should be postponed until the Lord's day, but at length it was agreed that it should take place the following day. On the following day again I preached to the people on this sort.</p>

<p>15. Yesterday I handled the verse, <q>Day unto day utters speech,</q>  as my ability enabled me; today <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture seems to me not only to have prophesied in former times, but even at the present. For when I behold your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> celebration continued day and night, the oracles of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet's</a> song have declared that these days, yesterday and today, are the days of which it is most opportunely said: <q>Day unto day utters speech;</q> and these the nights of which it is most fittingly said that <q>Night unto night shows <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> For what else but the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> have you during these two days uttered with inmost affection, and have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> yourselves to have the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<p>16. And they who usually do so have a grudge against this <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of yours; and since because of their <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> disposition they cannot endure this <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of it, and go so far in their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> as to deny the merits of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> even the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> confess. But this is not to be wondered at since such is the faithlessness of unbelievers that the confession of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is often more easy to endure. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> said: <q>Jesus, Son of the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, why are You come to torment us before the time?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343543"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;8:29</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> hearing this, even themselves denied Him to be the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And at this time you have heard the devils crying out, and confessing to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> that they cannot bear their sufferings, and saying, <q>Why are you come to torment us so severely?</q> And the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> say: <q>These are not <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and they cannot torment the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, nor deliver any one,</q> while the torments of the devils are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by their own words, and the benefits of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> are declared by the restoring of the healed, and the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of those that are loosed.</p>

<p>17. They deny that the blind man received sight, but he denies not that he is healed. He says: I who could not see now see. He says: I ceased to be blind, and proves it by the fact. They deny the benefit, who are unable to deny the fact.  The man is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: so long as he was well he was employed in the public service; his name is Severus, a butcher by trade. He had given up his occupation when this hindrance befell him. He calls for evidence those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> by whose kindness he was supported; he adduces those as able to affirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his visitation whom he had as witnesses of his blindness. He declares that when he touched the hem of the robe of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, wherewith the sacred relics were covered, his sight was restored.</p>

<p>18. Is not this like that which we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? For we praise the power of the same Author in each case, nor does it be a work or a gift, since He confers a gift in His works, and works in His gift. For that which He gave to others to be done, this His Name effects in the work of others. So we read in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when they saw the gift of healing in the blind man, called for the testimony of his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and asked: <q>How does your son see?</q> when he said: <q>Whereas I was blind, now I see.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343545"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;9:25</a></span> And in this case the man says, <q>I was blind and now I see.</q> Ask others if you do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me; ask strangers if you think his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> are in collusion with me. The obstinacy of these men is more hateful than that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, for the latter, when they <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, at least asked his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; the others enquire in secret and deny in public, incredulous not as to the work, but as to its Author.</p>

<p>19. But I ask what it is that they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; is it whether any one can be aided by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>? This is the same thing as not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for He Himself said: <q>You shall do greater things than these.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343546"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;14:12</a></span> How? By those <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> whose merits have been long efficacious, whose bodies were long since found? Here I ask, do they bear a grudge against me, or against the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>? If against me, are any <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> wrought by me? By my means or in my name? Why, then, grudge me what is not mine? If it be against the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> (for if they bear no grudge against me, it can only be against them), they show that the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> were of another <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than that which they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For otherwise they would not have any feeling against their works, did they not judge that they have not the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which was in them, that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> established by the tradition of our forefathers, which the devils themselves cannot deny, but the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> do.</p>

<p>21. We have today heard those on whom hands were laid say, that no one can be saved unless he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; that he is dead and buried who denies the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and believes not the almighty power of the Trinity. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> confesses this, but the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> refuse to do so. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> says: Let him who denies the Godhead of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> be so tormented as himself was tormented by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>.</p>

<p>22. I do not accept the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> testimony but his confession. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> spoke unwillingly, being compelled and tormented. That which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> suppresses, torture extracts. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> yields to blows, and the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> have not yet learned to yield. How great have been their sufferings, and yet, like <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, they are hardened by their calamities! The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> said, as we find it written: <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You Who You are, You are the Son of the living God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343547"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse24">Mark&nbsp;1:24</a></span> And the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> said: <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence He is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343548"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse30">John&nbsp;9:30</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> said today, yesterday, and during the night, We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> say, We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, we will not understand, we will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> say to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, You have come to destroy us. The <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> say, The torments of the devils are not real but fictitious and made-up tales. I have heard of many things being made up, but no one has ever been able to feign that he was an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit. What is the meaning of the torment we see in those on whom hands are laid? What room is there here for fraud? What suspicion of pretence?</p>

<p>23. But I will not make use of the voice of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">evil spirits</a> in support of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>. Their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sufferings are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the benefits they confer. These have <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to judge of them, namely, those who are cleansed, and witnesses, namely, those who are set free. That voice is better than that of devils, which the soundness of those utters who came infirm; better is the voice which blood sends forth, for blood has a loud voice reaching from earth to heaven. You have read how God said: <q>Your brother's blood cries unto Me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343549"><a href="../bible/gen004.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;4:10</a></span> This blood cries by its colour, the blood cries by the voice of its effects, the blood cries by the triumph of its passion. We have acceded to your request, and have postponed till today the deposition of the relics which was to have taken place yesterday.</p>
