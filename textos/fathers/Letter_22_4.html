<h1>Letter 22</h1>

<p> <em>The first from Flavian, Bp. of Constantinople to Pope Leo.</em></p>

<h2>I. The designs of the devil have led Eutyches astray.</h2>

<p>To the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and God-loving father and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Leo, Flavian greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>There is nothing which can stay the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, that <q>restless <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, full of deadly poison <span class="stiki" id="note360222"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse8">James&nbsp;3:8</a></span> .</q> Above and below it <q>goes about,</q> seeking <q>whom it may</q> strike, dismay, and <q>devour <span class="stiki" id="note360223"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> .</q> Whence to watch, to be sober unto <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, to draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to eschew foolish questionings, to follow the fathers and not to go beyond the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> bounds, this we have learned from Holy Writ. And so I give up the excess of grief and abundant tears over the capture of one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who are under me, and whom I could not save nor snatch from the wolf, although I was ready to lay down my life for him. How was he caught, how did he leap away, hating the voice of the caller and turning aside also from the memory of the Fathers and thoroughly detesting their paths. And thus I proceed with my account.</p>

<h2>II. The seductions of heretics capture the unwary.</h2>

<p>There are some <q>in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves <span class="stiki" id="note360224"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span>:</q> whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by their fruit. These men seem indeed at first to be of us, but they are not of us: <q>for if they had been of us, they would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have continued with us <span class="stiki" id="note360225"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> .</q> But when they have spewed out their impiety, throwing out the guile that is in them, and seizing the weaker ones, and those who have their senses unpractised in the divine utterances, they carry them along with themselves to destruction, wresting and doing despite to the Father.' doctrines, just as they do the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> also to their own destruction: whom we must be forewarned of and take heed lest some should be misled by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and shaken in their firmness. <q>For they have sharpened their tongues like serpents: adder's poison is under their lips ,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has cried out about them.</p>

<h2>III. Eutyches' heresy stated.</h2>

<p>Such a one, therefore, has now shown himself among us, Eutyches, for many years a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> and archimandrite , pretending to hold the same belief as ours, and to have the right Faith in him: indeed he resists the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and feigns a controversy with him, but the exposition of the Faith composed by the 318 <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers, and the letter that Cyril of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory wrote to <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, and one by the same author on the same subject to the Easterns, these writings, to which all have given their assent, he has tried to upset, and revive the old <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>. He has not feared the warning of the True King: <q>Whoso shall <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> one of the least of these little ones to stumble, it was better that a millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depth of the sea. </q> But casting away all shame, and shaking off the cloak which covered his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> , he openly in our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod persisted in saying that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> ought not to be understood by us as having two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> after His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> in one substance and in one person: nor yet that the Lord's flesh was of the same substance with us, as if assumed from us and united to <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> hypostatically: but he said that the Virgin who bare him was indeed of the same substance with us according to the flesh, but the Lord Himself did not assume from her flesh of the same substance with us: but the Lord's body was not a man's body, although that which issued from the Virgin was a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body, resisting all the expositions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers.</p>

<h2>IV. He has sent Leo the minutes of their proceedings that he may see all the details.</h2>

<p>But not to make my letter too long by detailing everything, we have sent your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> the proceedings which some time since we took in the matter: therein we deprived him as convicted on these charges, of his <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, of the management of his <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and of our communion: in order that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the facts of his case may make his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> manifest to all the God-loving <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are under your reverence; lest perchance if they do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the views which he holds, and of which he has been openly convicted, they may be found to be in correspondence with him as a fellow-believer by letter or by other means. I and those who are with me give much greeting to you and to all the brotherhood in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. The Lord keep you in safety and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> for us, O most God-Loving Father. </p>
