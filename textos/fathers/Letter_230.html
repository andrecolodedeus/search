<h1>Letter 230</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p>To the magistrates of Nicopolis.</p>

<p>The government of the Churches is carried on by those to whom the chief offices in them have been entrusted, but their hands are strengthened by the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. The measures which lay with the God-beloved <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been taken. The rest concerns you, if you deign to accord a hearty reception to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has been given you, and to make a vigorous resistance to attacks from outside. For nothing is so likely to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> discouragement to all, whether rulers or the rest who <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> your peaceful position, as agreement in affection to the appointed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and firmness in maintaining your ground. They are likely to despair of every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> attempt, if they see that their counsels are accepted neither by <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> nor by <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Bring it about then that your own sentiments as to the right  may be shared by all the city, and so speak to the citizens, and to all the inhabitants of the district, in confirmation of their good sentiments, that the genuineness of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to God may be everywhere <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. I trust that it may be permitted me one day to visit and inspect a Church which is the nursing mother of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, honoured by me as a metropolis of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, because it has from of old been under the government of men right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and the elect of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who have held fast to <q>the faithful word as we have been taught.</q>  You have approved him who has just been appointed as worthy of these predecessors, and I have agreed. May you be preserved by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. May He scatter the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsels of our enemies, and fix in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> strength and constancy to preserve what has been rightly determined on.</p>
