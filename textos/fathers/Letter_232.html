<h1>Letter 232</h1>

<p> <em>To the People of Madaura, My Lords Worthy of Praise, and Brethren Most Beloved, Augustine Sends Greeting, in Reply to the Letter Received by the Hands of Brother Florentinus.</em></p>

<p>1. If, perchance, such a letter as I have received was sent to me by those among you who are <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the only thing at which I am surprised is, that it was sent in the name of the municipality, and not in their own name. If, however, it has pleased all or almost all of your men of rank to send a letter to me, I am surprised at the title <q>Father</q> and the <q>salutation in the Lord</q> addressed to me by you, of whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> certainly, and with much regret, that you regard with superstitious veneration those <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> against which your temples are more easily shut than your hearts; or, I should rather say, those <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> which are not more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> shut up in your temples than in your hearts.  Can it be that you are at last, after wise reflection, seriously thinking of that <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, in whose name you have chosen to salute me? For if it be not so, I ask you, my lords worthy of all praise, and brethren most beloved, in what have I injured, in what have I offended your benevolence, that you should think it right to treat me with ridicule rather than with respect in the salutation prefixed to your letter?</p>

<p>2. For when I read the words, <q>To Father Augustine, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>,</q> I was suddenly elated with such fullness of hope, that I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> you either already converted to the Lord Himself, and to that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of which He is the author, or desirous, through our ministry, to be so converted. But when I read the rest of the letter my heart was chilled. I inquired, however, from the bearer of the letter, whether you were already <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or were desirous to be so. After I learned from his answer that you were in no way changed, I was deeply grieved that you thought it right not only to reject the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to whom you already see the whole world submitting, but even to insult His name in my person; for I could not think of any other Lord than Christ the Lord in whom a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could be addressed by you as a father, and if there had been any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the meaning to be attached to your words, it would have been removed by the closing sentence of your letter, where you say plainly, <q>We desire that, for many years, your lordship may always, in the midst of your <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, be glad in God and His Christ.</q> After reading and pondering all these things, what could I (or, indeed, could any man) think but that these words were written either as the genuine expression of the mind of the writers, or with an intention to deceive? If you write these things as the genuine expression of your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, who has barred your way to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Who has strewn it with thorns? What enemy has placed masses of rock across your path? In fine, if you are desiring to come in, who has shut the door of our places of worship against you, so that you are unwilling to enjoy the same <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with us in the same Lord in whose name you salute us? But if you write these things deceitfully and mockingly, do you, then, in the very act of imposing on me the care of your affairs, presume to insult, with the language of feigned adulation, the name of Him through whom alone I can do anything, instead of honouring Him with the veneration which is due to Him?</p>

<p>3. Be assured, dearest brethren, that it is with inexpressible trembling of heart on your account that I write this letter to you, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much greater in the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> must be your guilt and your doom if I shall have said these things to you in vain. In regard to everything in the history of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> which our forefathers observed and handed down to us, and not less in regard to everything connected with the seeking and holding of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion which we now see and put on record for those who come after us, the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> have not been silent; so far from this, all things come to pass exactly according to the predictions of Scripture. You cannot deny that you see the Jewish people torn from the abodes of their ancestry, dispersed and scattered over almost every country: now, the origin of that people, their gradual increase, their losing of the kingdom, their dispersion through all the world, have happened exactly as foretold. You cannot deny that you see that the word of the Lord, and the law coming forth from that people through Christ, who was miraculously born among their nation, has taken and retained possession of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of all nations: now we read of all these announced beforehand as we see them. You cannot deny that you see what we call <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms, that is, many cut off from the root of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> society, which by means of the Apostolic Sees, and the successions of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, is spread abroad in an indisputably world-wide diffusion, claiming the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and as withering branches boasting of the mere appearance of being derived from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> vine: all this has been foreseen, predicted, and described in Scripture. You cannot deny that you see some temples of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> fallen into ruin through neglect, others thrown down by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, others closed, and some applied to other purposes; you see the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> themselves either broken to pieces, or burnt, or shut up, or destroyed, and the same powers of this world, who in defence of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, now vanquished and subdued by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, who did not fight for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> but died for it, and directing their attacks and their <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> against the very <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> in defence of which they put <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to death, and the highest dignitary of the noblest empire laying aside his crown and kneeling as a suppliant at the tomb of the fisherman Peter.</p>

<p>4. The <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a>, which have now come into the hands of all, testified long before that all these things would come to pass. We <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that all these things have happened, with a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is strong in proportion to the discovery thereby made of the greatness of the authority with which they are declared in the sacred Scriptures. Seeing, then, that all these things have come to pass as foretold, are we, I ask, to suppose that the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which we read of in the same Scriptures as appointed to separate finally between the believing and the unbelieving, is the only event in regard to which the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> is to fail? Yea, certainly, as all these events have come, it shall also come. Nor shall there be a man of our time who shall be able in that day to plead anything in defence of his unbelief. For the name of Christ is on the lips of every man: it is invoked by the just man in doing <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjurer</a> in the act of deceiving, by the king to confirm his rule, by the soldier to nerve himself for battle, by the husband to establish his authority, by the wife to confess her submission, by the father to enforce his command, by the son to declare his <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, by the master in supporting his right to govern, by the slave in performing his duty, by the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in quickening <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, by the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> in stimulating ambition, by the rich man when he gives, and by the poor when he receives an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, by the drunkard at his wine-cup, by the beggar at the gate, by the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man in keeping his word, by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man in violating his promises: all frequently use the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> with genuine reverence, the Pagan with feigned respect; and they shall undoubtedly give to that same Being whom they invoke an account both of the spirit and of the language in which they repeat His name.</p>

<p>5. There is One invisible, from whom, as the Creator and First Cause, all things seen by us derive their being: He is supreme, <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, unchangeable, and comprehensible by none save Himself alone. There is One by whom the supreme Majesty utters and reveals Himself, namely, the Word, not inferior to Him by whom it is begotten and uttered, by which Word He who begets it is manifested. There is One who is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, the sanctifier of all that becomes <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, who is the inseparable and undivided mutual communion between this unchangeable Word by whom that First Cause is revealed, and that First Cause who reveals Himself by the Word which is His equal. But who is able with perfectly calm and pure mind to contemplate this whole Essence (whom I have endeavoured to describe without giving His name, instead of giving His name without describing Him), and to draw blessedness from that <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, and by sinking, as it were, in the rapture of such meditation, to become oblivious of self, and to press on to that the sight of which is beyond our sphere of perception; in other words, to be clothed with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, and obtain that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which you were pleased to desire on my behalf in your greeting? Who, I say, is able to do this but the man who, confessing his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, shall have levelled with the dust all the vain risings of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and prostrated himself in meekness and humility to receive God as his Teacher?</p>

<p>6. Since, therefore, it is necessary that we be first brought down from vain self-sufficiency to lowliness of spirit, that rising thence we may attain to real exaltation, it was not possible that this spirit could be produced in us by any method at once more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and more gentle (subduing our haughtiness by persuasion instead of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>) than that the Word by whom the Father reveals Himself to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who is His Power and Wisdom, who could not be discerned by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> heart so long as it was blinded by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the things which are seen, should condescend to assume our nature, and so to exercise and manifest His personality when incarnate as to make men more afraid of being elated by the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, than of being brought low after the example of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore the Christ who is preached throughout the whole world is not Christ adorned with an earthly crown, nor Christ rich in earthly treasures, nor Christ illustrious for earthly prosperity, but Christ crucified. This was ridiculed, at first, by whole nations of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> men, and is still ridiculed by a remnant among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, but it was the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> at first to a few and now to whole nations, because when Christ crucified was preached at that time, notwithstanding the ridicule of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, to the few who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, the lame received power to walk, the dumb to speak, the deaf to hear, the blind to see, and the dead were restored to life. Thus, at length, the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of this world was convinced that, even among the things of this world, there is nothing more powerful than the humility of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note113008"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:23-25</a></span> so that beneath the shield of a divine example that humility, which it is most profitable for men to practise, might find defence against the contemptuous assaults of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</p>

<p>7. O men of Madaura, my brethren, nay, my fathers,  I beseech you to awake at last: this opportunity of writing to you God has given to me. So far as I could, I rendered my service and help in the business of brother Florentinus, by whom, as God willed it, you wrote to me; but the business was of such a nature, that even without my assistance it might have been easily transacted, for almost all the men of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, who reside at Hippo, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Florentinus, and deeply regret his bereavement. But the letter was sent by you to me, that, having occasion to reply, it might not seem presumptuous on my part, when the opportunity was afforded me by yourselves, to say something concerning Christ to the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. But I beseech you, if you have not taken His name in vain in that epistle, suffer not these things which I write to you to be in vain; but if in using His name you wished to mock me, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> Him whom the world formerly in its <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> scorned as a condemned criminal, and whom the same world now, subjected to His sway, awaits as its Judge. For the desire of my heart for you, expressed as far as in my power by this letter, shall <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against you at the judgment-seat of Him who shall establish for ever those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him and confound the unbelieving. May the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God deliver you wholly from the vanity of this world, and turn you to Himself, my lords worthy of all praise and brethren most beloved.</p>
