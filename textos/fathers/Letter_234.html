<h1>Letter 234</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

 

<p>To the same, in answer to another question.</p>

<p>Do you worship what you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> or what you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? If I answer, I worship what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, they immediately reply, What is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the object of worship? Then, if I confess that I am <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, they turn on me again and say, So you worship you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what. I answer that the word to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> has many meanings. We say that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the greatness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, His power, His wisdom, His goodness, His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> over us, and the justness of His judgment; but not His very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. The question is, therefore, only put for the sake of dispute. For he who denies that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> does not confess himself to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because our idea of God is gathered from all the attributes which I have enumerated. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he says, is simple, and whatever attribute of Him you have reckoned as knowable is of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But the absurdities involved in this sophism are innumerable. When all these high attributes have been enumerated, are they all names of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>? And is there the same mutual force in His awfulness and His loving-kindness, His <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and His creative power, His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> and His foreknowledge, and His bestowal of rewards and punishments, His majesty and His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a>? In mentioning any one of these do we declare His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>? If they say, yes, let them not ask if we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but let them enquire of us whether we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God to be awful, or just, or merciful. These we confess that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. If they say that <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is something distinct, let them not put us in the wrong on the score of simplicity. For they confess themselves that there is a distinction between the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and each one of the attributes enumerated. The operations are various, and the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> simple, but we say that we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> our God from His operations, but do not undertake to approach near to His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. His operations come down to us, but His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> remains beyond our reach.</p>

<p>2. But, it is replied, if you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Himself. Retort, If you say that you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Himself. A man who has been bitten by a mad dog, and sees a dog in a dish, does not really see any more than is seen by people in good health; he is to be pitied because he thinks he sees what he does not see. Do not then admire him for his announcement, but pity him for his insanity. Recognise that the voice is the voice of mockers, when they say, if you are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you worship what you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. I do <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He exists; what His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is, I look at as beyond intelligence. How then am I saved? Through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> sufficient to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God exists, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what He is; and <q>He is a rewarder of them that seek Him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322956"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;11:6</a></span> So <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the divine <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> involves perception of His incomprehensibility, and the object of our worship is not that of which we comprehend the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, but of which we comprehend that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> exists.</p>

<p>3. And the following counter question may also be put to them. <q>No man has seen God at any time, the Only-begotten which is in the bosom has declared him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322957"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;1:18</a></span> What of the Father did the Only-begotten Son declare? His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or His power? If His power, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> so much as He declared to us. If His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, tell me where He said that His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> was the being unbegotten?  When did <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> worship? Was it not when he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>? And when did he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Was it not when he was called? Where in this place is there any testimony in Scripture to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> comprehending? When did the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> worship Him? Was it not when they saw creation subject to Him? It was from the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of sea and winds to Him that they recognised His Godhead. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> came from the operations, and the worship from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. <q>Believest thou that I am able to do this?</q> <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, Lord;</q>  and he worshipped Him. So worship follows <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is confirmed by power. But if you say that the believer also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> from what he believes; and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> versa he believes from what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God from His power. We, therefore, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him who is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and we worship Him who is <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in.</p>
