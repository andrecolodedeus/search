<h1>Letter 236</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p>To the same Amphilochius.</p>

<p>1. Enquiry has already frequently been made concerning the saying of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> as to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the day and of the hour of the end; <span class="stiki" id="note322976"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark&nbsp;13:32</a></span> an objection constantly put forward by the Anom&oelig;ans to the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Only-Begotten, in order to show Him to be unlike in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and subordinate in dignity; inasmuch as, if He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not all things, He cannot possess the same nature nor be regarded as of one likeness with Him, who by His own prescience and faculty of forecasting the future has <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> coextensive with the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>. This question has now been proposed to me by your intelligence as a new one. I can give in reply the answer which I heard from our fathers when I was a boy, and which on account of my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, I have received without question. I do not expect that it can undo the shamelessness of them that fight against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for where is the reasoning strong enough to stand their attack? It may, however, suffice to convince all that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord, and in whom the previous assurance supplied them by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is stronger than any demonstration of reason.</p>

<p>Now <q>no man</q> seems to be a general expression, so that not even one person is excepted by it, but this is not its use in Scripture, as I have observed in the passage <q>there is none good but one, that is, God.</q>  For even in this passage the Son does not so speak to the exclusion of Himself from the good nature. But, since the Father is the first good, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the words <q>no man</q> to have been uttered with the understood addition of <q>first.</q>  So with the passage <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Son but the Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322979"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;11:27</a></span> even here there is no charge of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but only a testimony that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His own nature naturally belongs to the Father first. Thus also we understand <q>No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322980"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;24:36</a></span> to refer to the Father the first <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things, both present and to be, and generally to exhibit to men the first <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. Otherwise how can this passage fall in with the rest of the evidence of Scripture, or agree with the common notions of us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the Only-Begotten is the image of the invisible <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and image not of the bodily figure, but of the very Godhead and of the mighty qualities attributed to the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, image of power, image of wisdom, as Christ is called <q>the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the wisdom of God</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note322981"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:24</a></span> Now of wisdom <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is plainly a part; and if in any part He falls short, He is not an image of the whole; and how can we understand the Father not to have shown that day and that hour&mdash; the smallest portion of the ages&mdash; to Him through Whom He made the ages? How can the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> fall short of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the smallest portion of the things created by Him? How can He who says, when the end is near, that such and such signs shall appear in heaven and in earth, be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the end itself? When He says, <q>The end is not yet.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322982"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;24:6</a></span> He makes a definite statement, as though with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and not in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Then further, it is plain to the fair enquirer that our Lord says many things to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, in the character of man; as for instance, <q>give me to drink</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322983"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse7">John&nbsp;4:7</a></span> is a saying of our Lord, expressive of His bodily necessity; and yet the asker was not soulless flesh, but Godhead using flesh endued with <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.  So in the present instance no one will be carried beyond the bounds of the interpretation of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, who understands the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of him who had received all things according to the &oelig;conomy,  and was advancing with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> in favour and wisdom. </p>

<p>2. It would be worthy of your diligence to set the phrases of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> side by side, and compare together those of Matthew and those of Mark, for these two alone are found in concurrence in this passage. The wording of Matthew is <q>of that day and hour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, no, not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of heaven, but my Father only.</q>  That of Mark runs, <q>But of that day and that hour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, no, not the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> which are in heaven, neither the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, but the Father.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322988"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark&nbsp;13:32</a></span> What is noticeable in these passages is this; that Matthew says nothing about the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and seems to agree with Mark as to sense in saying <q>but my Father only.</q> Now I understand the word <q>only</q> to have been used in contradistinction to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, but that the Son is not included with His own servants in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>.</p>

<p>He could not say what is false Who said <q>All things that the Father has are Mine,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322989"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;16:15</a></span> but one of the things which the Father has is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that day and of that hour. In the passage in Matthew, then, the Lord made no mention of His own Person, as a matter beyond controversy, and said that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not and that His Father alone <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, tacitly asserting the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His Father to be His own <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> too, because of what He had said elsewhere, <q>as the Father <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> me even so <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322990"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;10:15</a></span> and if the Father has complete <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, nothing excepted, so that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to dwell in Him, He will clearly be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as fully by the Son with all His inherent wisdom and all His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things to come. This modification, I think, may be given to the words of Matthew, <q>but my Father only.</q> Now as to the words of Mark, who appears distinctly to exclude the Son from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, my opinion is this. No man <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, neither the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; nor yet the Son would have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unless the Father had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: that is, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the Son's <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> comes from the Father. To a fair hearer there is no <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in this interpretation, because the word <q>only</q> is not added as it is in Matthew. Mark's sense, then, is as follows: of that day and of that hour <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no man, nor the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but even the Son would not have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> if the Father had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, for the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> naturally His was given by the Father. This is very decorous and becoming the divine nature to say of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He has, His <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> and His being, beheld in all the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which become His Godhead, from Him with Whom He is consubstantial.</p>

<p>3. As to Jeconias, whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah declares in these words to have been rejected from the land of Judah, <q>Jeconias was dishonoured like a vessel for which there is no more use; and because he was cast out he and his seed; and none shall rise from his seed sitting upon the throne of David and ruling in Judah,</q>  the matter is plain and clear. On the destruction of Jerusalem by <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, the kingdom had been destroyed, and there was no longer an hereditary succession of reigns as before. Nevertheless, at that time, the deposed descendants of David were living in captivity. On the return of Salathiel and Zerubbabel the supreme government rested to a greater degree with the people, and the sovereignty was afterwards transferred to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, on account of the intermingling of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> and royal tribes; whence the Lord, in things pertaining to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is both King and High Priest. Moreover, the royal tribe did not fail until the coming of the Christ; nevertheless, the seed of Jeconias sat no longer upon the throne of David. Plainly it is the royal dignity which is described by the term <q>throne.</q> You remember the history, how all Jud&aelig;a, Idum&aelig;a, Moab, both the neighbouring regions of <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and the further countries up to Mesopotamia, and the country on the other side as far as the river of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, were all tributary to David. If then none of his descendants appeared with a sovereignty so wide, how is not the word of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that no one of the seed of Jeconias should any longer sit upon the throne of David, for none of his descendants appears to have attained this dignity. Nevertheless, the <a href="../cathen/08536a.htm">tribe of Judah</a> did not fail, until He for whom it was destined came. But even He did not sit upon the material throne. The kingdom of Jud&aelig;a was transferred to <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a>, the son of Antipater the Ascalonite, and his sons who divided Jud&aelig;a into four principalities, when <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> was Procurator and <a href="../cathen/14717b.htm">Tiberius</a> was Master of the Roman Empire. It is the indestructible kingdom which he calls the throne of David on which the Lord sat. He is the expectation of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> <span class="stiki" id="note322992"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;49:10</a></span> and not of the smallest division of the world, for it is written, <q>In that day there shall be a root of Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> seek.</q>  <q>I have called you...for a covenant of the people for a light of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a></q>;  and thus then God remained a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> although He did not receive the sceptre of Judah, and King of all the earth; so the blessing of Jacob was fulfilled, and in Him <span class="stiki" id="note322995"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm#verse18">Genesis&nbsp;22:18</a></span> <q>shall all the nations of the earth be blessed,</q> and all the nations shall call the Christ blessed.</p>

<p>4. And as to the tremendous question put by the facetious <a href="../cathen/05412c.htm">Encratites</a>, why we do not eat everything? Let this answer be given, that we turn with disgust from our excrements. As far as dignity goes, to us flesh is grass; but as to distinction between what is and what is not serviceable, just as in vegetables, we separate the unwholesome from the wholesome, so in flesh we distinguish between that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and that which is bad for food. Hemlock is a vegetable, just as vulture's flesh is flesh; yet no one in his senses would eat henbane nor dog's flesh unless he were in very great straits. If he did, however, he would not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<p>5. Next as to those who maintain that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs are governed by <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, do not ask information from me, but stab them with their own shafts of rhetoric. The question is too long for my present infirmity. With regard to emerging in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash; I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how it came into your mind to ask such a question, if indeed you understood immersion to fulfil the figure of the three days. It is impossible for any one to be immersed three times, without emerging three times. We write the word <span class="greek">&#x03C6;&#x1F71;&#x03B3;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> paroxytone. </p>

<p>6. The distinction between <span class="greek">&#x03BF;&#x1F50;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1F51;</span> <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1F79;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03B1;&#x03C3;&#x03B9;&#x03C2;</span> is the same as that between the general and the particular; as, for instance, between the animal and the particular man. Wherefore, in the case of the Godhead, we confess one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or substance so as not to give a variant definition of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but we confess a particular hypostasis, in order that our conception of Father, Son and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> may be without confusion and clear.  If we have no distinct perception of the separate characteristics, namely, fatherhood, sonship, and sanctification, but form our conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the general idea of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, we cannot possibly give a sound account of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We must, therefore, confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by adding the particular to the common. The Godhead is common; the fatherhood particular. We must therefore combine the two and say, <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father.</q> The like course must be pursued in the confession of the Son; we must combine the particular with the common and say <q>I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in God the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>,</q> so in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> we must make our utterance conform to the appellation and say <q>in God  the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> Hence it results that there is a satisfactory preservation of the unity by the confession of the one Godhead, while in the distinction of the individual properties regarded in each there is the confession of the peculiar properties of the Persons. On the other hand those who identify <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or substance and hypostasis are compelled to confess only three Persons,  and, in their hesitation to speak of three hypostases, are convicted of failure to avoid the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Sabellius, for even Sabellius himself, who in many places confuses the conception, yet, by asserting that the same hypostasis changed its form  to meet the needs of the moment, does endeavour to distinguish <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>.</p>

<p>7. Lastly as to your enquiry in what manner things neutral and indifferent are ordained for us, whether by some chance working by its own accord, or by the righteous <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my answer is this: Health and sickness, riches and poverty, credit and discredit, inasmuch as they do not render their possessors good, are not in the category of things naturally good, but, in so far as in any way they make life's current flow more easily, in each case the former is to be preferred to its contrary, and has a certain kind of value. To some men these things are given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> for stewardship's sake,  as for instance to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, to Job and such like. To inferior characters they are a challenge to improvement. For the man who persists in unrighteousness, after so goodly a token of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, subjects himself to condemnation without defence. The <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, however, neither turns his heart to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> when he has it, nor seeks after it if he has it not. He treats what is given him as given him not for his selfish enjoyment, but for wise administration. No one in his senses runs after the trouble of distributing other people's property, unless he is trying to get the praise of the world, which admires and envies anybody in authority.</p>

<p>Good men take sickness as athletes take their contest, waiting for the crowns that are to reward their endurance. To ascribe the dispensation of these things to any one else is as inconsistent with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion as it is with common sense.</p>
