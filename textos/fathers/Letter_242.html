<h1>Letter 242</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To the Westerns</em>. </p>

<p>1. The Holy God has promised a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> of issue out of all their infirmities to those that trust in Him. We, therefore, though we have been cut off in a mid-ocean of troubles, though we are tossed by the great waves raised up against us by the spirits of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, nevertheless hold out in Christ Who strengthens us. We have not slackened the strength of our <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, nor, as though despairing of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, while the billows in the tempest rise above our heads, do we look to be destroyed. On the contrary, we are still holding out with all possible earnestness, remembering how even he who was swallowed by the sea monster, because he did not despair of his life, but cried to the Lord, was saved. Thus too we, though we have reached the last pitch of peril, do not give up our hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On every side we see His succour round about us. For these reasons now we turn our eyes to you, right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> brethren. In many an hour of our affliction we have expected that you would be at our side; and disappointed in that hope we have said to ourselves, <q>I looked for some to take pity and there was none; and for comforters but I found none.</q>  Our sufferings are such as to have reached the confines of the empire; and since, when one member suffers, all the members suffer, <span class="stiki" id="note323033"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:26</a></span> it is doubtless right that your pity should be shown to us who have been so long in trouble. For that sympathy, which we have hoped you of your charity feel for us, is caused less by nearness of place than by union of spirit.</p>

<p>2. How comes it to pass then that we have received nothing of what is due to us by the law of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; no letter of consolation, no visit from brethren? This is now the thirteenth year since the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> began against us.  In this the Churches have suffered more tribulations than all those which are on record since Christ's gospel was first preached.  I am unwilling to describe  these one by one, lest the feebleness of my narrative should make the evidence of the calamities less convincing. It is moreover the less necessary for me to tell you of them, because you have long <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> what has happened from the reports which will have reached you. The sum and substance of our troubles is this: the people have left the houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and are holding congregations in the wildernesses. It is a sad sight. Women, boys, old men, and those who are in other ways infirm, remain in the open air, in heavy rain, in the snow, the gales and the frost of winter as well as in summer under the blazing heat of the sun. All this they are suffering because they refuse to have anything to do with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> leaven of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>.</p>

<p>3. How could mere words give you any clear idea of all this without your being stirred to sympathy by personal experience and the evidence of eyewitnesses? We implore you, therefore, to stretch out a helping hand to those that have already been stricken to the ground, and to send messengers to remind us of the prizes in store for the reward of all who patiently suffer for Christ. A voice that we are used to is naturally less able to comfort us than one which sounds from afar, and that one coming from men who over all the world are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to be among the noblest; for common report everywhere represents you as having remained steadfast, without suffering a wound in your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and as having kept the deposit of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> inviolate. This is not our case. There are among us some who, through <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and that puffing up which is especially wont to destroy the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men, have audaciously uttered certain novelties of expression with the result that the Churches have become like cracked pots and pans and have let in the inrush of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> impurity. But do you, whom we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and long for, be to us as surgeons for the wounded, as trainers for the whole, healing the limb that is diseased, and anointing the limb that is sound for the service of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion.</p>
