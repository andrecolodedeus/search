<h1>Letter 243</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> concerning the condition and confusion of the Churches.</p>

<p>1. To his brethren <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> God-beloved and very dear, and fellow ministers of like <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, Basil, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea in Cappadocia. <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Who has deigned to style the universal <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> His body, and has made us individually members one of another, has moreover granted to all of us to live in intimate association with one another, as befits the agreement of the members. Wherefore, although we dwell far away from one another, yet, as regards our close conjunction, we are very near. Since, then, the head cannot say to the feet, I have no need of you, <span class="stiki" id="note323037"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:21</a></span> you will not, I am sure, endure to reject us; you will, on the contrary, sympathize with us in the troubles to which, for our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, we have been given over, in proportion as we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> together with you in your glorying in the peace which the Lord has bestowed on you. Ere now we have also at another time invoked your charity to send us succour and sympathy; but our punishment was not full, and you were not suffered to rise up to succour us. One chief object of our desire is that through you the state of confusion in which we are situated should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the emperor of your part of the world.  If this is difficult, we beseech you to send envoys to visit and comfort us in our affliction, that you may have the evidence of eyewitnesses of those sufferings of the East which cannot be told by word of mouth, because language is inadequate to give a clear report of our condition.</p>

<p>2. Persecution has come upon us, right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> brethren, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> in the severest form. Shepherds are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> that their flocks may be scattered. And the worst of all is that those who are being treated ill cannot accept their sufferings in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their testimony, nor can the people reverence the athletes as in the army of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, because the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is applied to the persecutors. The one charge which is now sure to secure severe punishment is the careful keeping of the traditions of the Fathers. For this the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> are exiled from their homes, and are sent away to dwell in distant regions. No reverence is shown by the judges of iniquity to the hoary head, to practical <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, to the life lived from boyhood to old age according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. No malefactor is doomed without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been convicted on <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> alone, and are consigned to penalties on charges wholly unsupported by evidence. Some have not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> who has accused them, nor been brought before any tribunal, nor even been <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accused at all. They have been apprehended with <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> late at night, have been exiled to distant places, and, through the hardships of these remote wastes, have been given over to death.  The rest is notorious, though I make no mention of it&mdash; the flight of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>; the flight of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>; the foraying of all the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Either the image must be worshipped, or we are delivered to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> flame of whips.  The <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> groan; tears are falling without ceasing in public and in private; all are mutually lamenting their woes. No one's heart is so hard as to lose a father, and bear the bereavement meekly. There is a sound of them that mourn in the city&mdash; a sound in the fields, in the roads, in the deserts. But one voice is heard from all that utter sad and piteous words. Joy and spiritual <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> are taken away. Our feasts are turned into mourning. <span class="stiki" id="note323041"><a href="../bible/amo008.htm#verse10">Amos&nbsp;8:10</a></span> Our houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> are shut. The altars of the spiritual service are lying idle. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> no longer assemble together; teachers no longer preside. The doctrines of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> are no longer taught. We have no more solemn assemblies, no more evening <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a>, no more of that blessed <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> which arises in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of all that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Lord at communions, and the imparting of spiritual boons.  We may well say, <q>Neither is there at this time prince, or <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, or reader, or offering, or <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, or place to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> before you, and to find mercy.</q> </p>

<p>3. We are writing to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these things, for there is not a region of the world which is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of our calamities. Do not suppose that we are using these words as though to give information, or to recall ourselves to your recollection. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you could no more forget us than a mother forget the sons of her womb. <span class="stiki" id="note323044"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse15">Isaiah&nbsp;49:15</a></span> But all who are crushed by any weight of agony find some natural alleviation for their pain in uttering groans of distress, and it is for this that we are doing as we do. We get rid of the load of our grief in telling you of our manifold misfortunes, and in expressing the hope that you may haply be the more moved to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for us, and may prevail on the Lord to be reconciled to us. And if these afflictions had been confined to ourselves, we might even have determined to keep silence, and to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in our sufferings for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, since <q>the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which shall be revealed in us.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note323045"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;8:18</a></span> But at the present time we are alarmed, lest the mischief growing day by day, like a flame spreading through some burning wood, when it has consumed what is close at hand, may catch distant objects too. The plague of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is spreading, and there is ground of apprehension lest, when it has devoured our Churches, it may afterwards creep on even so far as to the sound portion of your district.  Peradventure it is because with us iniquity has abounded that we have been first delivered to be devoured by the cruel teeth of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the gospel of the kingdom began in our regions, and then went forth over all the world. So, perhaps&mdash; and this is most probable&mdash; the common enemy of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, is striving to bring it about that the seeds of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, originating in the same quarter, should be distributed throughout the world. For the darkness of impiety plots to come upon the very hearts whereon the <q>light of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a></q> of Christ has shone. </p>

<p>4. Reckon then, as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Lord, that our sufferings are yours. We are not being attacked for the sake of riches, or <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, or any temporal advantages. We stand in the arena to fight for our common heritage, for the treasure of the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, derived from our Fathers. Grieve with us, all you who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the brethren, at the shutting of the mouths of our men of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, and at the opening of the bold and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> lips of all that utter unrighteousness against God.  The pillars and foundation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are scattered abroad. We, whose insignificance has allowed of our being overlooked, are deprived of our right of free speech. Do ye enter into the struggle, for the people's sake. Do not think only of your being yourselves moored in a safe haven, where the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God gives you shelter from the tempest of the winds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. Reach out a helping hand to the Churches that are being buffeted by the storm, lest, if they be abandoned, they suffer complete shipwreck of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Lament for us, in that the Only-begotten is being <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>, and there is none to offer contradiction. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is being set at nought and he who is able to confute the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> has been sent into exile. Polytheism has prevailed. Our opponents own a great God and a small God. <q>Son</q> is no longer a name of nature, but is looked upon as a title of some kind of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is regarded not as complemental of the Holy Trinity, nor as participating in the divine and blessed Nature, but as in some sort one of the number of created beings, and attached to Father and Son, at mere haphazard and as occasion may require. <q>Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note323049"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse1">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:1</a></span> and I will weep many days for the people who are being driven to destruction by these vile doctrines. The ears of the simple are being led astray, and have now got used to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> impiety. The nurslings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are being brought up in the doctrines of iniquity. What are they to do? Our opponents have the command of baptisms; they speed the dying on their way;  they visit the sick; they console the sorrowful; they aid the distressed; they give succour of various kinds; they communicate the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. All these things, as long as the performance of them is in their hands, are so many ties to bind the people to their views. The result will be that in a little time, even if some liberty be conceded to us, there is small hope that they who have been long under the influence of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> will be recalled to recognition of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>5. Under these circumstances it would have been well for many of us to have travelled to your reverences, and to have individually reported each his own position. You may now take as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the sore straits in which we are placed the fact that we are not even free to travel abroad. For if any one leaves his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even for a very brief space, he will leave his people at the mercy of those who are plotting their ruin. By God's mercy instead of many we have sent one, our very reverend and beloved brother the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Dorotheus. He is fully able to supply by his personal report whatever has been omitted in our letter, for he has carefully followed all that has occurred, and is jealous of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>. Receive him in peace, and speedily send him back to us, bringing us good news of your readiness to succour the brotherhood.</p>
