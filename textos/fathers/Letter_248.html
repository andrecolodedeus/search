<h1>Letter 248</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

 

<p>To Amphilochius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Iconium.</p>

<p>So far as my own wishes are concerned I am grieved at living at such a distance from your reverence. But, as regards the peace of your own life, I thank the Lord Who has kept you out of this conflagration which has specially ravaged my diocese. For the just Judge has sent me, in accordance with my works, a messenger of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>,  who is buffeting me  severely enough, and is vigorously defending the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. Indeed to such a pitch has he carried the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against us, that he does not shrink even from shedding the blood of those who trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. You cannot fail to have heard that a man of the name of Asclepius,  because he would not consent to communion with Doeg,  has died under the blows inflicted on him by them, or rather, by their blows has been translated into life. You may suppose that the rest of their doings are of a piece with this; the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and teachers, and all that might be expected to be done by men abusing the imperial authority at their own caprice. But, in answer to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the Lord will give us release from these things, and patience to bear the weight of our trials worthily of our hope in Him. Pray write frequently to me of all that concerns yourself. If you find any one who can be trusted to carry you the book that I have finished, be so kind as to send for it, that so, when I have been cheered by your approval, I may send it on to others also. By the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Holy One may you be granted to me and to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord in good health rejoicing in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for me.</p>
