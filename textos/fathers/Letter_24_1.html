<h1>Letter 24</h1>

<p><strong>To Marcella</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Concerning the virgin Asella. Dedicated to God before her birth, Marcella's sister had been made a church-virgin at the age of ten. From that time she had lived a life of the severest <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">asceticism</a>, first as a member and then as the head of Marcella's community upon the Aventine. Jerome, who subsequently wrote her a letter (XLV) on his departure from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, now holds her up as a model to be admired and imitated. Written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> A.D. 384.</span> </p>

<p>1. Let no one blame my letters for the eulogies and censures which are contained in them. To arraign sinners is to admonish those in like case, and to praise the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> is to quicken the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of those who wish to do right. The day before yesterday I spoke to you concerning Lea of blessed memory,  and I had hardly done so, when I was pricked in my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. It would be wrong for me, I thought, to ignore a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> after speaking of one who, as a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, held a lower place. Accordingly, in my present letter, I mean to give you a brief sketch of the life of our dear Asella. Please do not read it to her; for she is sure to be displeased with eulogies of which she is herself the object. Show it rather to the young girls of your acquaintance, that they may guide themselves by her example, and may take her behavior as the pattern of a perfect life.</p>

<p>2. I pass over the facts that, before her birth, she was blessed while still in her mother's womb, and that, virgin-like, she was delivered to her father in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> in a bowl of shining glass brighter than a mirror. And I say nothing of her consecration to the blessed life of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, a ceremony which took place when she was hardly more than ten years old, a mere babe still wrapped in swaddling clothes. For all that comes before works should be counted of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note300698"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;11:6</a></span> although, doubtless, God foreknew the future when He sanctified  Jeremiah as yet unborn, <span class="stiki" id="note300699"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:5</a></span> when He made John to leap in his mother's womb, <span class="stiki" id="note300700"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;1:41</a></span> and when, before the foundation of the world, He set apart <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to preach the gospel of His son. <span class="stiki" id="note300701"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;1:4</a></span> </p>

<p>3. I come now to the life which after her twelfth year she, by her own exertion, chose, laid hold of, held fast to, entered upon, and fulfilled. Shut up in her narrow cell she roamed through paradise. Fasting was her recreation and hunger her refreshment. If she took food it was not from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of eating, but because of bodily exhaustion; and the bread and <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> and cold water to which she restricted herself sharpened her appetite more than they appeased it.</p>

<p>But I have almost forgotten to mention that of which I should have spoken first. When her resolution was still fresh she took her gold necklace made in the lamprey pattern (so called because bars of metal are linked together so as to form a flexible chain), and sold it without her <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Then putting on a dark dress such as her mother had never been willing that she should wear, she concluded her <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> enterprise by consecrating herself immediately to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. She thus showed her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> that they need hope to wring no farther concessions from one who, by her very dress, had condemned the world.</p>

<p>4. To go on with my story, her ways were quiet and she lived in great privacy. In fact, she rarely went abroad or spoke to a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. More wonderful still, much as she loved her virgin sister,  she did not care to see her. She worked with her own hands, for she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that it was written: <q>If any will not work neither shall he eat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300703"><a href="../bible/2th003.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:10</a></span> To the Bridegroom she spoke constantly in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and psalmody. She hurried to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs'</a> shrines unnoticed. Such visits gave her pleasure, and the more so because she was never recognized. All the year round she observed a continual fast, remaining without food for two or three days at a time; but when Lent came she hoisted&mdash; if I may so speak&mdash; every stitch of canvas and fasted nearly from week's end to week's end with <q>a cheerful countenance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300704"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;6:17</a></span> What would perhaps be incredible, were it not that <q>with God all things are possible,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300705"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;19:26</a></span> is that she lived this life until her fiftieth year without weakening her digestion or bringing on herself the pain of colic. Lying on the dry ground did not affect her limbs, and the rough sackcloth that she wore failed to make her skin either foul or rough. With a sound body and a still sounder <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>  she sought all her delight in solitude, and found for herself a <a href="../cathen/10459a.htm">monkish</a> hermitage in the centre of busy Rome.</p>

<p>5. You are better acquainted with all this than I am, and the few details that I have given I have learned from you. So intimate are you with Asella that you have seen, with your own eyes, her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> knees hardened like those of a camel from the frequency of her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. I merely set forth what I can glean from you. She is alike pleasant in her serious moods and serious in her pleasant ones: her manner, while winning, is always grave, and while grave is always winning. Her pale face indicates continence but does not betoken ostentation. Her speech is silent and her silence is speech. Her pace is neither too fast nor too slow. Her demeanor is always the same. She disregards refinement and is careless about her dress. When she does attend to it it is without attending. So entirely consistent has her life been that here in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the centre of vain shows, wanton license, and idle pleasure, where to be <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> is to be held spiritless, the good praise her conduct and the bad do not venture to impugn it. Let <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> imitate her, let wedded wives make much of her, let sinful <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> her, and let <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>  look up to her.</p>
