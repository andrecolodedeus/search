<h1>Letter 24</h1>

<p>Leo the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to Theodosius Augustus.</p>

<h2>I. He praises the Emperor's piety and mentions Eutyches' appeal.</h2>

<p>How much protection the Lord has vouchsafed His Church through your clemency and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, is shown again by this letter which you have sent me: so that we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at there being not only a kingly, but also a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> mind within you. Seeing that, besides your imperial and public cares, you have a most devout anxiety for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, lest schisms or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> or other offenses should grow up among God's people. For your realm is then in its best state when men serve the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and unchangeable Trinity by the confession of one Godhead.  What the disturbance was which occurred in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Constantinople, and which could have so moved my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Flavian, that he deprived Eutyches, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, of communion, I have not yet been able to understand clearly. For although the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> sent in writing a complaint concerning his trouble to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, yet he only briefly touched on some points, asserting that he kept the constitutions of the Nicene synod and had been vainly blamed for difference of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</p>

<h2>II. He finds fault with Flavian's silence.</h2>

<p>But the statement of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Eusebius, his accuser, copies of which the said <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> has sent us, contained nothing clear about his objections, and though he charged a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, he did not say expressly what opinion he disapproved of in him: although the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself also professed that he adhered to the decrees of the Nicene synod: for which reason we had no means of learning anything more fully. And because the method of our Faith and the laudable anxiety shown by your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> requires the merits of the case to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, there must now be no place allowed for deception, but we must be informed of the points on which he considers him unsound, that the right judgment may be passed after full information. I have sent a letter to the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, from which he may gather that I am displeased at his still keeping silence upon what has been done in so grave a matter, when he ought to have been forward in disclosing all to us at the outset: and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even after the reminder he will acquaint us with the whole, in order that, when what now seems obscure, has been brought into the light, judgment may be passed agreeably to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and the Apostles. Dated the 18th of February , in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>
