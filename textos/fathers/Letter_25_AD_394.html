<h1>Letter 25 (A.D. 394)</h1>

<p> <em>To Augustine, Our Lord and Brother Beloved and Venerable, from <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a> and Therasia, Sinners.</em></p>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ which constrains us, and which unites us, though separated by distance, in the bond of a common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, has itself emboldened me to dismiss my <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> and address a letter to you; and it has given you a place in my inmost heart by means of your writings&mdash; so full of the stores of learning, so sweet with celestial honey, the medicine and the nourishment of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. These I at present have in five books, which, through the kindness of our blessed and venerable Bishop Alypius, I received, not only as a means of my own instruction, but for the use of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in many towns. These books I am now reading: in them I take great delight: in them I find food, not that which perishes, but that which imparts the substance of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life through our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whereby we are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> made members of His body; for the writings and examples of the faithful do greatly strengthen that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which, not looking at things seen, longs after things not seen with that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which accepts implicitly all things which are according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11251c.htm">omnipotent</a> God. O <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth, by which our hearts are preserved from being corrupted by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the world! O light worthy of your place on the candlestick of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, diffusing widely in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> towns the brightness of a flame fed by the oil of the seven-branched lamp of the upper sanctuary, you also disperse even the thick mists of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and rescue the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from the confusion of darkness by the beams of your luminous demonstrations.</p>

<p>2. You see, my brother beloved, esteemed, and welcomed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our Lord, with what intimacy I claim to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, with what amazement I admire and with what <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> I embrace you, seeing that I enjoy daily converse with you by the medium of your writings, and am fed by the breath of your mouth. For your mouth I may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> call a pipe conveying living water, and a channel from the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> fountain; for Christ has become in you a fountain of <q>living water springing up into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111502"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span> Through desire for this my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> thirsted within me, and my parched ground longed to be flooded with the fullness of your river. Since, therefore, you have armed me completely by this your Pentateuch against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, if you have prepared any treatises in defence of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against other enemies (for our enemy, with his thousand pernicious stratagems, must be defeated by weapons as various as the artifices by which he assails us), I beg you to bring these forth from your armoury for me, and not refuse to furnish me with the <q>armour of righteousness.</q> For I am oppressed even now in my work with a heavy burden, being, as a sinner, a veteran in the ranks of sinners, but an untrained recruit in the service of the King <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>. The wisdom of this world I have unhappily hitherto regarded with admiration, and, devoting myself to literature which I now see to be unprofitable, and wisdom which I now reject, I was in the sight of God foolish and dumb. When I had become old in the fellowship of my enemies, and had laboured in vain in my thoughts, I lifted my eyes to the mountains, looking up to the precepts of the law and to the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, whence my help came from the Lord, who, not requiting me according to mine iniquity, enlightened my blindness, loosed my bonds, humbled me who had been sinfully exalted, in order that He might exalt me when graciously humbled.</p>

<p>3. Therefore I follow, with halting pace indeed as yet, the great examples of the just, if I may through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> apprehend that for which I have been apprehended by the compassion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Guide, therefore, this infant creeping on the ground, and by your steps teach him to walk. For I would not have you judge of me by the age which began with my natural birth, but by that which began with my spiritual new birth. For as to the natural life, my age is that which the cripple, healed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> by the power of their word at the gate Beautiful, had attained.  But with respect to the birth of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, mine is as yet the age of those infants who, being <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> by the death-blows which were aimed at Christ, preceded with blood worthy of such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the offering of the Lamb, and were the harbingers of the passion of the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note111504"><a href="../bible/mat002.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;2:16</a></span> Therefore, as I am but a babe in the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and as to spiritual age a sucking child, satisfy my vehement desire by nourishing me with your words, the breasts of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and wisdom, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. If you consider only the office which we both hold, you are my brother; but if you consider the ripeness of your understanding and other powers, you are, though my junior in years, a father to me; because the possession of a venerable wisdom has promoted you, though young, to a maturity of worth, and to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which belongs to those who are old. Foster and strengthen me, then, for I am, as I have said, but a child in the sacred Scriptures and in spiritual studies; and seeing that, after long contendings and frequent shipwreck, I have but little skill, and am even now with difficulty rising above the waves of this world, do you, who have already found firm footing on the shore, receive me into the safe refuge of your bosom, that, if it please you, we may together sail towards the harbour of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Meanwhile, in my efforts to escape from the dangers of this life and the abyss of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, support me by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, as by a plank, that from this world I may escape as one does from a shipwreck, leaving all behind.</p>

<p>4. I have therefore been at pains to rid myself of all baggage and garments which might impede my progress, in order that, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the command and sustained by the help of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I may swim, unhindered by any clothing for the flesh or care for the morrow, across the sea of this present life, which, swelling with waves and echoing with the barking of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, like the dogs of Scylla, separates between us and God. I do not boast that I have accomplished this: even if I might so boast, I would <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> only in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, whose it is to accomplish what it is our part to desire; but my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is in earnest that the judgments of the Lord be her chief desire. You can judge how far he is on the way to efficiently performing the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is desirous that he may desire to perform it. Nevertheless, so far as in me lies, I have loved the beauty of His sanctuary, and, if left to myself, would have chosen to occupy the lowest place in the Lord's house. But to Him who was pleased to separate me from my mother's womb, and to draw me away from the friendship of flesh and blood to His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to raise me from the earth and from the gulf of misery, though destitute of all merit, and to take me from the mire and from the dunghill, to set me among the princes of His people, and appoint my place in the same rank with yourself; so that, although you excel me in worth, I should be associated with you as your equal in office.</p>

<p>5. It is not therefore by my own presumption, but in accordance with the pleasure and appointment of the Lord, that I appropriate the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of which I own myself unworthy, claiming for myself the bond of brotherhood with you; for I am persuaded, from the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of your character, that you are taught by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <q>not to mind high things, but to condescend to men of low estate.</q> Therefore I hope that you will readily and kindly accept the assurance of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which in humility we bear to you, and which, I trust, you have already received through the most blessed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> Alypius, whom (with his permission) we call our father. For he doubtless has himself given you an example of loving us both while we are yet strangers, and above our desert; for he has found it possible, in the spirit of far-reaching and self-diffusing genuine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, to behold us by affection, and to come in contact with us by writing, even when we were unknown to him, and severed by a wide interval both of land and sea. He has presented us with the first <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of his affection to us, and evidences of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in the above-mentioned gift of books. And as he was greatly concerned that we should be constrained to ardent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for you, when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, not by his testimony alone, but more fully by the eloquence and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> seen in your own writings; so do we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he has taken care, with equal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, to bring you to imitate his example in cherishing a very warm <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards us in return. O brother in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, beloved, venerable, and ardently longed for, we desire that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it is with you, may abide for ever. We salute, with the utmost affection of cordial brotherhood, your whole household, and every one who is in the Lord a companion and imitator of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. We beg you to bless, in accepting it, one loaf which we have sent to your Charity, in token of our oneness of heart with you.</p>
