<h1>Letter 263</h1>

<p> <em>To the Eminently Religious Lady and Holy Daughter Sapida, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. The gift prepared by the just and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> industry of your own hands, and kindly presented by you to me, I have accepted, lest I should increase the grief of one who needs, as I perceive, much rather to be comforted by me; especially because you expressed yourself as esteeming it no small consolation to you if I would wear this tunic, which you had made for that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> servant of God your brother, since he, having departed from the land of the dying, is raised above the need of the things which perish in the using. I have, therefore, complied with your desire, and whatever be the kind and degree of consolation which you may feel this to yield, I have not refused it to your affection for your brother.  The tunic which you sent I have accordingly accepted,  and have already begun to wear it before writing this to you. Be therefore of good cheer; but apply yourself, I beseech you, to far better and far greater consolations, in order that the cloud which, through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness, gathers darkness closely round your heart, may be dissipated by the words of divine authority; and, at all times, so live that you may live with your brother, since he has so died that he lives still.</p>

<p>2. It is indeed a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for tears that your brother, who loved you, and who honoured you especially for your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> life, and your profession as a <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> virgin, is no more before your eyes, as hitherto, going in and out in the assiduous discharge of his <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> duties as a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and that you shall no more hear from his lips the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> testimony which, with kindly, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, and becoming affection, he was wont to render to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of a sister so dear to him. When these things are pondered, and are regretfully desired  with all the vehemence of long-cherished affection, the heart is pierced, and, like blood from the pierced heart, tears flow apace. But let your heart rise heavenward, and your eyes will cease to weep.  The things over the loss of which you mourn have indeed passed away, for they were in their nature temporary, but their loss does not involve the annihilation of that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with which Timotheus loved [his sister] Sapida, and loves her still: it abides in its own treasury, and is hidden with Christ in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Does the miser lose his gold when he stores it in a secret place? Does he not then become, so far as lies in his power, more confidently assured that the gold is in his possession when he keeps it in some safer hiding-place, where it is hidden even from his eyes? Earthly <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> believes that it has found a safer guardianship for its loved treasures when it no longer sees them; and shall heavenly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> sorrow as if it had lost for ever that which it has only sent before it to the garner of the upper world? O Sapida, give yourself wholly to your high calling, and set your affections  on things above, where, at the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Christ sits, who condescended for us to die, that we, though we were dead, might live, and to secure that no man should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death as if it were destined to destroy him, and that no one of those for whom the Life died should after death be mourned for as if he had lost life. Take to yourself these and other similar divine consolations, before which <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sorrow may blush and flee away.</p>

<p>3. There is nothing in the sorrow of mortals over their dearly beloved dead which merits displeasure; but the sorrow of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> ought not to be prolonged. If, therefore, you have been grieved till now, let this grief suffice, and sorrow not as do the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, <q>who have no hope.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note113028"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:12</a></span> For when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> said this, he did not prohibit sorrow altogether, but only such sorrow as the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> manifest who have no hope. For even Martha and Mary, <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sisters, and <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, wept for their brother Lazarus, of whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he would rise again, though they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not that he was at that time to be restored to life; and the Lord Himself wept for that same Lazarus, whom He was going to bring back from death; <span class="stiki" id="note113029"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;11:19-35</a></span> wherein doubtless He by His example permitted, though He did not by any precept enjoin, the shedding of tears over the graves even of those regarding whom we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that they shall rise again to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life. Nor is it without good reason that <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says in the book of Ecclesiasticus: <q>Let tears fall down over the dead, and begin to lament as if you had suffered great harm yourself;</q> but adds, a little further on, this counsel, <q>and then comfort yourself for your heaviness. For of heaviness comes death, and the heaviness of the heart breaks strength.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note113030"><a href="../bible/sir038.htm#verse16">Sirach&nbsp;38:16-18</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Your brother, my daughter, is alive as to the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, is asleep as to the body: <q>Shall not he who sleeps also rise again from sleep?</q>  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has already received his spirit, shall again give back to him his body, which He did not take away to annihilate, but only took aside to restore. There is therefore no reason for protracted sorrow, since there is a much stronger reason for everlasting <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. For even the mortal part of your brother, which has been buried in the earth, shall not be for ever lost to you&mdash;that part in which he was visibly present with you, through which also he addressed you and conversed with you, by which he spoke with a voice not less thoroughly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your ear than was his countenance when presented to your eyes, so that, wherever the sound of his voice was heard, even though he was not seen, he used to be at once recognised by you. These things are indeed withdrawn so as to be no longer perceived by the senses of the living, that the absence of the dead may make surviving friends mourn for them. But seeing that even the bodies of the dead shall not perish (as not even a hair of the head shall perish), <span class="stiki" id="note113032"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse18">Luke&nbsp;21:18</a></span> but shall, after being laid aside for a time, be received again never more to be laid aside, but fixed finally in the higher condition of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> into which they shall have been changed, certainly there is more <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for thankfulness in the sure hope for an immeasurable <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, than for sorrow in the transient experience of a very short span of time. This hope the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> do not possess, because they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> nor the power of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note113033"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;22:29</a></span> who is able to restore what was lost, to quicken what was dead, to renew what has been subjected to corruption, to re-unite things which have been severed from each other, and to preserve thenceforward for evermore what was originally corruptible and shortlived. These things He has promised, who has, by the fulfilment of other promises, given our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> good ground to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these also shall be fulfilled. Let your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> often discourse now to you on these things, because your hope shall not be disappointed, though your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> may be now for a season interrupted in its exercise; ponder these things; in them find more solid and abundant consolation. For if the fact that I now wear (because he could not) the garment which you had woven for your brother yields some comfort to you, how much more full and satisfactory the comfort which you should find in considering that he for whom this was prepared, and who then did not require an imperishable garment, shall be clothed with incorruption and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>!</p>
