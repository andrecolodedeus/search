<h1>Letter 265</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p>To Eulogius, Alexander, and Harpocration, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, in exile.</p>

<p>1. In all things we find that the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> exercised by our good God over His Churches is mighty, and that thus the very things which seem to be gloomy, and do not turn out as we should like, are ordained for the advantage of most, in the hidden wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in the unsearchable judgments of His righteousness. Now the Lord has removed you from the regions of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and has brought you and established you in the midst of Palestine, after the manner of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> of old, whom He carried away by captivity into the land of the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a>, and there extinguished <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> through the sojourn of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Now too we find the same thing, when we observe that the Lord is making <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> your struggle for the sake of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion, opening to you through your exile the arena of your blessed contests, and to all who see before them your noble constancy, giving the boon of your good example to lead them to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. By God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, I have heard of the correctness of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and of your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the brethren and that it is in no careless or perfunctory spirit that you provide what is profitable and necessary for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and that you support all that conduces to the edification of the Churches. I have therefore thought it right that I should be brought into communion with your goodness, and be united to your reverences by letter. For these reasons I have sent my very dear brother the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Elpidius, who not only conveys my letter, but is moreover fully qualified to announce to you whatever may have been omitted in my letter.</p>

<p>2. I have been specially moved to desire union with you by the report of the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of your reverences in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. The constancy of your hearts has been stirred neither by multiplicity of books nor by variety of ingenious arguments. You have on the contrary, recognised those who endeavoured to introduce innovations in opposition to the apostolic doctrines, and you have refused to keep silence concerning the mischief which they are causing. I have in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> found great distress among all who cleave to the peace of the Lord at the various innovations of Apollinarius of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>. He has all the more distressed me from the fact that he seemed at the beginning on our side. A sufferer can in a certain sense endure what comes to him from an open enemy, even though it be exceedingly painful, as it is written, <q>For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it.</q>  But it is intolerable, and beyond the power of comfort, to be wronged by a close and sympathetic friend. Now that very man whom I have expected to have at my right hand in defence of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I have found in many ways hindering those who are being saved, by seducing their minds and drawing them away from direct doctrine. What rash and hasty deed has he not done? What ill considered and dangerous argument has he not risked? Is not all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> divided against herself, specially since the day when men have been sent by him to the Churches governed by <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, to rend them asunder and to set up some peculiar and illegal service? Is not ridicule brought upon the great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion when <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> go about without people and <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, having nothing but the mere name and title, and effecting nothing for the advancement of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of peace and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? Are not his discourses about God full of impious doctrines, the old impiety of the insane Sabellius being now renewed by him in his writings? For if the works which are current among the Sebastenes are not the <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> of foes, and are really his composition, he has reached a height of impiety which cannot be surpassed, in saying that Father, Son, and Spirit are the same, and other dark pieces of irreverence which I have declined even to hear, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that I may have nothing to do with those who have uttered them. Does he not confuse the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>? Has not the &oelig;conomy of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> been made doubtful to the many on account of his dark and cloudy speculations about it? To collect them all, and refute them, requires long time and much discussion. But where have the promises of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> been blunted and destroyed as by his figments? So meanly and poorly has he dared to explain the blessed hope laid up for all who live according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as to reduce it to mere old wives' fables and doctrines of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. He proclaims the renewal of the Temple, the observance of the worship of the Law, a typical <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> over again after the real High Priest, and a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> after the Lamb of God Who takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world. <span class="stiki" id="note323201"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> He preaches partial baptisms after the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which, through its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has not spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; <span class="stiki" id="note323202"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> cleansing of <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> after the painless state of the resurrection; an offering of jealousy  when they neither marry nor are given in marriage; <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">show-bread</a> after the Bread from heaven; burning lamps after the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Light. In a word, if the law of the Commandments has been done away with by <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>, it is plain that under these circumstances the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of Christ will be nullified by the injunctions of the law.  At these things shame and disgrace have covered my face,  and heavy grief has filled my heart. Wherefore, I beseech you, as skilful physicians, and instructed how to discipline antagonists with gentleness, to try and bring him back to the right order of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and to persuade him to despise the wordiness of his own works; for he has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the proverb <q>in the multitude of words there wants not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note323206"><a href="../bible/pro010.htm#verse19">Proverbs&nbsp;10:19</a></span> Put boldly before him the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, in order that his amendment may be published abroad, and his repentance made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to his brethren.</p>

<p>3. It is also desirable that I should remind your reverence about the followers of Marcellus, in order that you may decide nothing in their case rashly or inconsiderately. On account of his impious doctrines he has gone out from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  It is therefore necessary that his followers should only be received into communion on condition that they <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, in order that those who are united to me through you may be accepted by all the brethren. And now most men are moved to no small grief on hearing that you have both received them and admitted them to <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> communion on their coming to your excellency. Nevertheless you ought to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you do not stand alone in the East, but have many in communion with you, who vindicate the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> of the Fathers, and who put forth the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> doctrine of the Faith at Nic&aelig;a. The Westerns also all agree with you and with me, whose exposition of the Faith I have received and keep with me, assenting to their sound doctrine. You ought, then, to have satisfied all who are in agreement with you, that the action which is being taken may be ratified by the general consent, and that peace may not be broken by the acceptance of some while others are kept apart. Thus you ought to have at the same time seriously and gently taken counsel about matters which are of importance to all the Churches throughout the world. Praise is not due to him who hastily determines any point, but rather to him who rules every detail firmly and unalterably, so that when his judgment is enquired into, even at a later time, it may be the more esteemed. This is the man who is acceptable both to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and man as one who guides his words with discretion.  Thus I have addressed your reverence in such terms as are possible in a letter. May the Lord grant that one day we may meet, that so, after arranging everything together with you for the government of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, I may with you receive the reward prepared by the righteous Judge for faithful and wise stewards. In the mean time be so good as to let me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> with what intention you have received the followers of Marcellus, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, that even if you secure everything, so far as you yourselves are concerned, you ought not to deal with a matter of such importance on your own sole responsibility. It is further necessary that the Westerns, and those who are in communion with them in the East, should concur in the restoration of these men.</p>
