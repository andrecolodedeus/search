<h1>Letter 26</h1>

<p> <em>A Second One from Flavian to Leo.</em></p>

<h2>1. Eutyches' heresy restated.</h2>

<p>To the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed father and fellow-minister Leo, Flavian greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>Nothing, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, most beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is more precious to <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> than <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and the right dividing of the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For all our hope and safety, and the recompense of promised good depend thereon. For this reason we must take all pains about the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith, and those things which have been set forth and decreed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, that always, and in all circumstances, they may be kept and guarded whole and uninjured. And so it was necessary on the present occasion for us, who see the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> Faith suffering harm, and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> and <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> being revived by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Eutyches, not to overlook it, but publicly to disclose it for the people's safety. For this man: this Eutyches, keeping his diseased and sickly opinion hid within him, has dared to attack our gentleness, and unblushingly and shamelessly to instil his own <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> into many minds: saying that before the Incarnation indeed, our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> had two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a>, Godhead and manhood: but that after the union they became one nature; not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>  what he says, or on what he is speaking so decidedly. For even the union of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> that came together in Christ did not, as your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, confuse their properties in the process: but the properties of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> remain entire even in the union. And he added another <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> also, saying that the Lord's body which sprang from Mary was not of our substance, nor of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> matter: but, though he calls it <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, he refuses to say it was consubstantial with us or with her who bare him, according to the flesh. </p>

<h2>II. The means Eutyches has taken to circumvent the Synod.</h2>

<p>And this notwithstanding that the acts of Ephesus , in the letter written by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical synod to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and deposed <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a>, contain these express words: <q>the natures which came together to form <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> unity are indeed different: and yet from them both there is but one Christ and Son. Not as if the difference between the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> was done away with through the union, but rather that these same natures, His Godhead and His Manhood perfected for us one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, through an ineffable and incomprehensible meeting which resulted in unity.</q> And this does not escape your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, who have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> read the record of what was done at Ephesus. Yet this same Eutyches attaching no weight to these words, thinks he is not liable to the penalties fixed by that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and ecumenical synod. For this reason, finding that many of the simpler-minded folk were injured in their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by his contention, upon his being accused by the devout Bishop Eusebius, and upon his attending at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council, and with his own mouth declaring what he thought to the members of the synod, we have deposed him for his estrangement from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith, as your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> will learn from the resolutions passed about him: which we have sent with this our letter. Moreover, it is fair in my opinion that you should be told this also that this same Eutyches, after suffering just and canonical deposition, instead of making amends for his earlier by his later conduct , and appeasing God by careful penitence and many tears, and by a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> repentance, comforting our heart which was greatly saddened at his fall: not only did not do so, but even made every effort to throw the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> church of this place into confusion: setting up in public placards full of insults and maledictions, and beyond this addressing his entreaties to our most religious and Christ-loving Emperor, and these too over-flowing with arrogance and sauciness, whereby he tried to override the divine canons in everything.</p>

<h2>III. He acknowledges the receipt of Leo's letter.</h2>

<p>But after all this had occurred, your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness'</a> letter was conveyed to us by the most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> count Pansophius: and from it we learned that the same Eutyches had sent you a letter full of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> and cunning, saying that at the time of trial he had presented letters of appeal to us, and to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who were then present, and had appealed to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>: this he certainly never did, but in this matter, too, he has been guilty of deceit, like the father of lies, thinking to gain your ear. Therefore, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> father, being stirred by all that he has ventured, and by what has been done, and is being done against us and the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, use your accustomed promptitude as becomes the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and in defending the commonweal and peace of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches, consent by your own letter  to endorse the resolution that has been canonically passed against him, and to confirm the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our most religious and Christ-loving Emperor. For the matter only requires your weight and support, which through your wisdom will at once bring about general peace and quietness. For thus both the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which has arisen, and the disorder it has excited, will easily be appeased by God's assistance through a letter from you: and the rumoured synod will also be prevented, and so the most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches throughout the world need not be disturbed. I and all that are with me salute all the brethren that are with you. May you be granted to us safe in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and still <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for us, O most God-Loving and Holy Father.</p>
