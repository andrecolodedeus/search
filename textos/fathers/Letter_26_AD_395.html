<h1>Letter 26 (A.D. 395)</h1>

<p> <em>To Licentius</em>  <em>from Augustine.</em></p>

<p>1. I have with difficulty found an opportunity for writing to you: who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it? Yet Licentius must take my word for it. I do not wish you to search curiously for the causes and reasons of this; for though they could be given, your confidence in me acquits me of obligation to furnish them. Moreover, I received your letters by messengers who were not available for the carrying back of my reply. And as to the thing which you asked me to ask, I attended to it by letter as far as it seemed to me right to bring it forward; but with what result you may have seen. If I have not yet succeeded, I will press the matter more earnestly, either when the result comes to my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or when you yourself remind me of it. Thus far I have spoken to you of the things in which we hear the sound of the chains of this life. I pass from them. Receive now in a few words the utterance of my heart's anxieties concerning your hope for <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>, and the question how a way may be opened for you to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, my dear Licentius, that you, while repeatedly rejecting and dreading the restraints of wisdom, as if these were bonds, are becoming firmly and fatally in bondage to mortal things. For wisdom, though at first it restrains men, and subdues them by some labours in the way of discipline, gives them presently <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> freedom, and enriches them, when free, with the possession and enjoyment of itself; and though at first it educates them by the help of temporary restraints, it folds them afterwards in its <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> embrace, the sweetest and strongest of all conceivable bonds. I admit, indeed, that these initial restraints are somewhat hard to bear; but the ultimate restraints of wisdom I cannot call grievous, because they are most sweet; nor can I call them easy, because they are most firm: in short, they possess a quality which cannot be described, but which can be the object of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and hope, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. The bonds of this world, on the other hand, have a real harshness and a delusive charm, certain pain and uncertain pleasure, hard toil and troubled rest, an experience full of misery, and a hope devoid of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. And are you submitting neck and hands and feet to these chains, desiring to be burdened with honours of this kind, reckoning your labours to be in vain if they are not thus rewarded, and spontaneously aspiring to become fixed in that to which neither persuasion nor force ought to have induced you to go? Perhaps you answer, in the words of the slave in Terence,</p>

<blockquote><p><q>So ho, you are pouring out wise words here.</q></p></blockquote>

<p>Receive my words, then, that I may pour them out without wasting them. But if I sing, while you prefer to dance to another tune, even thus I do not regret my effort to give advice; for the exercise of singing yields pleasure even when the song fails to stir to responsive motion the person for whom it is sung with loving care. There were in your letters some verbal mistakes which attracted my attention, but I judge it trifling to discuss these when solicitude about your actions and your whole life disturbs me.</p>

<p>3. If your verses were marred by defective arrangement, or violated the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of prosody, or grated on the ears of the hearer by imperfect rhythm, you would doubtless be ashamed, and you would lose no time, you would take no rest, until you arranged, corrected, remodelled, and balanced your composition, devoting any amount of earnest study and toil to the acquisition and practice of the art of versification: but when you yourself are marred by disorderly living, when you violate the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when your life accords neither with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> desires of friends on your behalf, nor with the light given by your own learning, do you think this is a trifle to be cast out of sight and out of mind? As if, forsooth, you thought yourself of less value than the sound of your own voice, and esteemed it a smaller matter to displease God by ill-ordered life, than to provoke the censure of grammarians by ill-ordered syllables.</p>

<p>4. You write thus: <q>Oh that the morning light of other days could with its gladdening chariot bring back to me bright hours that are gone, which we spent together in the heart of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and among the high mountains, when proving the generous leisure and pure privileges which belong to the good! Neither stern winter with its frozen snow, nor the rude blasts of Zephyrs and raging of Boreas, could deter me from following your footsteps with eager tread. You have only to express your wish.</q> </p>

<p>Woe be to me if I do not express this wish, nay, if I do not compel and command, or beseech and implore you to follow me. If, however, your ear is shut against my voice, let it be open to your own voice, and give heed to your own poem: listen to yourself, O friend, most unyielding, unreasonable, and unimpressible. What care I for your tongue of gold, while your heart is of iron? How shall I, not in verses, but in lamentations, sufficiently bewail these verses of yours, in which I discover what a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, what a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that is which I am not permitted to seize and present as an offering to our God? You are waiting for me to express the wish that you should become good, and enjoy rest and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>: as if any day could shine more pleasantly on me than that in which I shall enjoy in God your gifted <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, or as if you did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how I hunger and thirst for you, or as if you did not in this poem itself confess this. Return to the mind in which you wrote these things; say to me now again, <q>You have only to express your wish.</q> Here then is my wish, if my expression of it be enough to move you to comply: Give yourself to me&mdash; give yourself to my Lord, who is the Lord of us both and who has endowed you with your faculties: for what am I but through Him your servant, and under Him your fellow-servant?</p>

<p>5. Nay, has not He given expression to His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>? Hear the gospel: it declares, <q>Jesus stood and cried.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111507"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37</a></span> <q>Come unto me, all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: so shall you find rest to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111508"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;11:28-30</a></span> If these words are not heard, or are heard only with the ear, do you, Licentius, expect Augustine to issue his command to his fellow-servant, and not rather complain that the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of his Lord is despised, when He orders, nay invites, and as it were entreats all who labour to seek rest in Him? But to your strong and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> neck, forsooth, the yoke of the world seems easier than the yoke of Christ; yet consider, in regard to the yoke which He imposes, by whom and with what recompense it is imposed. Go to Campania, learn in the case of <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a>, that eminent and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how great worldly honours he shook off, without hesitation, from neck <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> noble because <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, in order that he might place it, as he has done, beneath the yoke of Christ; and now, with his mind at rest, he meekly rejoices in Him as the guide of his way. Go, learn with what <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of mind he offers to Him the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of praise, rendering unto Him all the good which he has received from Him, lest, by failing to store all that he has in Him from whom he received it, he should lose it all.</p>

<p>6. Why are you so excited? Why so wavering? Why do you turn your ear away from us, and lend it to the imaginations of fatal pleasures? They are false, they perish, and they lead to perdition. They are false, Licentius. <q>May the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> as you desire, <q>be made plain to us by demonstration, may it flow more clear than Eridanus.</q> The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> alone declares what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: Christ is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; let us come to Him that we may be released from labour. That He may heal us, let us take His yoke upon us, and learn of Him who is meek and lowly in heart, and we shall find rest unto our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>: for His yoke is easy, and His burden is light. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> desires to wear you as an ornament. Now, if you found in the earth a golden chalice, you would give it to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. But you have received from God talents that are spiritually valuable as gold; and do you devote these to the service of your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and surrender yourself to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>? Do it not, I entreat you. May you at some time perceive with what a sad and sorrowful heart I have written these things; and I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, have pity on me if you have ceased to be precious in your own eyes.</p>
