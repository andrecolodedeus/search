<h1>Letter 277</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

 

<p>To the learned Maximus.</p>

<p>The excellent Theotecnus has given mean account of your highness, whereby he has inspired me with a longing for your acquaintance, so clearly do his words delineate the character of your mind. He has enkindled in me so ardent an affection for you, that were it not that I am weighed down with age, that I am the victim of a congenital ailment, that I am bound hand and foot by the numberless cares of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nothing would have hindered my coming to you. For indeed it is no small gain that a member of a great house, a man of illustrious lineage, in adopting the life of the gospel, should bridle the propensities of youth by reflection, and subject to reason the affections of the flesh; should display a humility consistent with his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> profession, bethinking himself, as is his duty, whence he has come and whither he is going. For it is this consideration of our nature that reduces the swelling of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and banishes all boastfulness and arrogance. In a word it renders one a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of our Lord, Who said, <q>Learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note323234"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;11:29</a></span> And in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, very dear son, the only thing that deserves our exertions and praises is our everlasting welfare; and this is the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> that comes from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Human affairs are fainter than a shadow; more deceitful than a dream. Youth fades more quickly than the flowers of spring; our beauty wastes with age or sickness. Riches are uncertain; <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is fickle. The pursuit of arts and sciences is bounded by the present life; the charm of eloquence, which all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>, reaches but the ear: whereas the practice of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is a precious possession for its owner, a delightful spectacle for all who <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> it. Make this your study; so will you be worthy of the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things promised by the Lord.</p>

<p>But a recital of the means whereby to make the acquisition, and secure the enjoyment of these blessings, lies beyond the intention of this present letter. Thus much however, after what I heard from my brother Theotecnus, it occurred to me to write to you. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that he may always speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, especially in his accounts of you; that the Lord may be the more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> in you, abounding as you do in the most precious fruits of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, although derived from a foreign root.</p>
