<h1>Letter 27</h1>

<p><strong>To Marcella</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">In this letter Jerome defends himself against the charge of having altered the text of Scripture, and shows that he has merely brought the Latin Version of the N.T. into agreement with the Greek original. Written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> 384 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. After I had written my former letter,  containing a few remarks on some Hebrew words, a report suddenly reached me that certain contemptible creatures were deliberately assailing me with the charge that I had endeavored to correct passages in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, against the authority of the ancients and the opinion of the whole world. Now, though I might&mdash; as far as strict right goes&mdash; treat these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with contempt (it is idle to play the lyre for an ass ), yet, lest they should follow their usual habit and reproach me with superciliousness, let them take my answer as follows: I am not so dull-wilted nor so coarsely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> (qualities which they take for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, calling themselves the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of fishermen as if men were made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> by <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> nothing)&mdash; I am not, I repeat, so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> as to suppose that any of the Lord's words is either in need of correction or is not divinely inspired; but the Latin manuscripts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be faulty by the variations which all of them exhibit, and my object has been to restore them to the form of the Greek original, from which my detractors do not deny that they have been translated. If they dislike water drawn from the clear spring, let them drink of the muddy streamlet, and when they come to read the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, let them lay aside  the keen eye which they turn on woods frequented by game-birds and waters abounding in shellfish. Easily satisfied in this instance alone, let them, if they will, regard the words of Christ as rude sayings, albeit that over these so many great intellects have labored for so many ages rather to divine than to expound the meaning of each single word. Let them charge the great apostle with want of literary skill, although it is said of him that much learning made him mad. <span class="stiki" id="note300711"><a href="../bible/act026.htm#verse24">Acts&nbsp;26:24</a></span> </p>

<p>2. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that as you read these words you will knit your brows, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that my freedom of speech is sowing the seeds of fresh quarrels; and that, if you could, you would gladly put your finger on my mouth to prevent me from even speaking of things which others do not blush to do. But, I ask you, wherein have I used too great license? Have I ever embellished my dinner plates with engravings of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>? Have I ever, at a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> banquet, set before the eyes of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> the polluting spectacle of Satyrs embracing bacchanals? Or have I ever assailed any one in too bitter terms? Have I ever complained of beggars turned millionaires? Have I ever censured heirs for the funerals which they have given to their benefactors?  The one thing that I have unfortunately said has been that <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> ought to live more in the company of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> than of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>,  and by this I have made the whole city look scandalized and caused every one to point at me the finger of scorn. <q>They that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> me without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> are more than the hairs of mine head,</q>  and I have become <q>a proverb to them.</q>  Do you suppose after this that I will now say anything rash?</p>

<p>3. But <q>when I set the wheel rolling I began to form a wine flagon; how comes it that a waterpot is the result?</q>  Lest Horace laugh at me I come back to my two-legged asses, and din into their ears, not the music of the lute, but the blare of the trumpet.  They may say if they will, <q>rejoicing in hope; serving <em>the time</em>,</q> but we will say <q>rejoicing in hope; serving <em>the Lord</em>.</q>  They may see fit to receive an accusation against a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> unconditionally; but we will say in the words of Scripture, <q>Against an elder  receive not an accusation, <em>but before two or three witnesses</em>. Them that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> rebuke before all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300720"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:19-20</a></span> They may choose to read, <q>It is <em>a man's</em> saying, and worthy of all acceptation;</q> we are content to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> with the Greeks, that is to say with the apostle himself, who spoke Greek. Our version, therefore, is, it is <q>a <em>faithful</em> saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300721"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:15</a></span> Lastly, let them take as much pleasure as they please in their Gallican <q>geldings;</q>  we will be satisfied with the simple <q>ass</q> of Zechariah, loosed from its halter and made ready for the Saviour's service, which received the Lord on its back, and so fulfilled Isaiah's prediction: <q>Blessed is he that sows beside all waters, where the ox and the ass tread under foot.</q> </p>
