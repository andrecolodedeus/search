<h1>Letter 27 (A.D. 395)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Lord, Holy and Venerable, and Worthy of Highest Praise in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, My Brother <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a>, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. O excellent man and excellent brother, there was a time when you were unknown to my mind; and I charge my mind to bear patiently your being still unknown to my eyes, but it almost&mdash; nay, altogether&mdash; refuses to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>. Does it indeed bear this patiently? If so, why then does a longing for your presence rack my inmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? For if I were suffering bodily infirmities, and these did not interrupt the serenity of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, I might be <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> said to bear them patiently; but when I cannot bear with equanimity the privation of not seeing you, it would be intolerable were I to call my state of mind patience. Nevertheless, it would perhaps be still more intolerable if I were to be found patient while absent from you, seeing that you are such an one as you are. It is well, therefore, that I am unsatisfied under a privation which is such that, if I were satisfied under it, every one would <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> be dissatisfied with me. What has befallen me is strange, yet <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: I grieve because I do not see you, and my grief itself comforts me; for I neither admire nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> a <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> easily consoled under the absence of good men such as you are. For do we not long for the heavenly Jerusalem? And the more impatiently we long for it, do we not the more patiently submit to all things for its sake? Who can so withhold himself from <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in seeing you, as to feel no pain when you are no longer seen? I at least can do neither; and seeing that if I could, it could only be by trampling on right and natural feeling, I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that I cannot, and in this rejoicing I find some consolation. It is therefore not the removal, but the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, of this sorrow that consoles me. Blame me not, I beseech you, with that devout seriousness of spirit which so eminently distinguishes you; say not that I do wrong to grieve because of my not yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> you, when you have disclosed to my sight your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is the inner man. For if, when sojourning in any place, or in the city to which you belong, I had come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you as my brother and friend, and as one so eminent as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, so noble as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, how could you think that it would be no disappointment  to me if I were not permitted to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your dwelling? How, then, can I but mourn because I have not yet seen your face and form, the dwelling-place of that mind which I have come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as if it were my own?</p>

<p>2. For I have read your letter, which flows with milk and honey, which exhibits the simplicity of heart wherewith, under the guidance of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, you seek the Lord, and which brings <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to Him. The brethren have read it also, and find unwearied and ineffable satisfaction in those abundant and excellent gifts with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has endowed you. As many as have read it carry it away with them, because, while they read, it carries them away. Words cannot express how sweet is the savour of Christ which your letter breathes. How strong is the wish to be more fully acquainted with you which that letter awakens by presenting you to our sight! For it at once permits us to discern and prompts us to desire you. For the more effectually that it makes us in a certain sense realize your presence, the more does it render us impatient under your absence. All <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you as seen therein, and wish to be loved by you. Praise and thanksgiving are offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you are what you are. In your letter, Christ is awakened that He may be pleased to calm the winds and the waves for you, directing your steps towards His perfect steadfastness.  In it the reader beholds a wife  who does not bring her husband to effeminacy, but by union to him is brought herself to share the strength of his nature; and unto her in you, as completely one with you, and bound to you by spiritual ties which owe their strength to their purity, we desire to return our salutations with the respect due to your Holiness. In it, the cedars of Lebanon, levelled to the ground, and fashioned by the skilful craft of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> into the form of the Ark, cleave the waves of this world, fearless of decay. In it, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is scorned that it may be secured, and the world given up that it may be gained. In it, the little ones, yea, the mightier sons of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of turbulence and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, are dashed against the rock.</p>

<p>3. These and other such most delightful and hallowed spectacles are presented to the readers of your letter&mdash;that letter which exhibits a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, a good hope, a pure <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. How it breathes to us your thirst, your longing and fainting for the courts of the Lord! With what <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it is inspired! How it overflows with the abundant treasure of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart! What thanksgivings it renders to God! What blessings it procures from Him! Is it elegance or fervour, light or life-giving power, which shines most in your letter? For how can it at once soothe us and animate us? How can it combine fertilizing rains with the brightness of a cloudless sky? How is this? I ask; or how shall I repay you, except by giving myself to be wholly yours in Him whose you wholly are? If this be little, it is at least all I have to give. But you have made me think it not little, by your deigning to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> me in that letter with such praises, that when I requite you by giving myself to you, I would be chargeable if I counted the gift a small one, with refusing to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> your testimony. I am ashamed, indeed, to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> so much good spoken of myself, but I am yet more unwilling to refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you. I have one way of escape from the dilemma: I shall not credit your estimate of my character, because I do not recognise myself in the portrait you have drawn; but I shall <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> myself to be beloved by you, because I perceive and feel this beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. Thus I shall be found neither rash in judging of myself, nor ungrateful for your esteem. Moreover, when I offer myself to you, it is not a small offering; for I offer one whom you very warmly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and one who, though he is not what you suppose him to be, is nevertheless one for whom you are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that he may become such. And your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> I now beg the more earnestly, lest, thinking me to be already what I am not, you should be less solicitous for the supply of that which I lack.</p>

<p>4. The bearer of this letter  to your Excellency and most eminent Charity is one of my dearest friends, and most intimately <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me from early years. His name is mentioned in the treatise <em>De Religione</em>, which your Holiness, as you indicate in your letter, has read with very great pleasure, doubtless because it was made more acceptable to you by the recommendation of so good a man as he who sent it to you.  I would not wish you, however, to give credence to the statements which, perchance, one who is so intimately my friend may have made in praise of me. For I have often observed, that, without intending to say what was untrue, he was, by the bias of friendship, mistaken in his opinion concerning me, and that he thought me to be already possessed of many things, for the gift of which my heart earnestly waited on the Lord. And if he did such things in my presence, who may not conjecture that out of the fullness of his heart he may utter many things more excellent than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> concerning me when absent? He will submit to your esteemed attention, and review all my treatises; for I am not aware of having written anything, either addressed to those who are beyond the pale of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or to the brethren, which is not in his possession. But when you are reading these, my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a>, let not those things which Truth has spoken by my weak instrumentality, so carry you away as to prevent your carefully observing what I myself have spoken, lest, while you drink in with eagerness the things good and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which have been given to me as a servant, you should forget to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the pardon of my <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and mistakes. For in all that shall, if observed, <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> displease you, I myself am seen; but in all which in my books is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> approved by you, through the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> bestowed on you, He is to be loved, He is to be praised, with whom is the fountain of life, and in whose light we shall see light,  not darkly as we do here, but face to face. <span class="stiki" id="note111514"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:12</a></span> When, in reading over my writings, I discover in them anything which is due to the working of the old leaven in me, I blame myself for it with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sorrow; but if anything which I have spoken is, by God's gift, from the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> therein with trembling. For what have we that we have not received? Yet it may be said, his portion is better whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has endowed with larger and more numerous gifts, than his on whom smaller and fewer have been conferred. True; but, on the other hand, it is better to have a small gift, and to render to Him due thanks for it, than, having a large gift, to wish to claim the merit of it as our own. Pray for me, my brother, that I may make such acknowledgments sincerely, and that my heart may not be at variance with my tongue. Pray, I beseech you, that, not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveting</a> praise to myself, but rendering praise to the Lord, I may worship Him; and I shall be safe from mine enemies.</p>

<p>5. There is yet another thing which may move you to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more warmly the brother who bears my letter; for he is a kinsman of the venerable and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Alypius, whom you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with your whole heart, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a>: for whoever thinks highly of that man, thinks highly of the great mercy and wonderful gifts which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has bestowed on him. Accordingly, when he had read your request, desiring him to write for you a sketch of his history, and, while willing to do it because of your kindness, was yet unwilling to do it because of his humility, I, seeing him unable to decide between the respective claims of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and humility, transferred the burden from his shoulders to my own, for he enjoined me by letter to do so. I shall therefore, with God's help, soon place in your heart Alypius just as he is: for this I chiefly feared, that he would be afraid to declare all that God has conferred on him, lest (since what he writes would be read by others besides you) he should seem to any who are less competent to discriminate to be commending not God's goodness bestowed on men, but his own merits; and that thus you, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what construction to put on such statements, would, through his regard for the infirmity of others, be deprived of that which to you as a brother ought to be imparted. This I would have done already, and you would already be reading my description of him, had not my brother suddenly resolved to set out earlier than we expected. For him I bespeak a welcome from your heart and from your lips as kindly as if your acquaintance with him was not beginning now, but of as long standing as my own. For if he does not shrink from laying himself open to your heart, he will be in great measure, if not completely, healed by your lips; for I desire him to be often made to hear the words of those who cherish for their friends a higher <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than that which is of this world.</p>

<p>6. Even if Romanianus had not been going to visit your Charity, I had resolved to recommend to you by letter his son [Licentius], dear to me as my own (whose name you will find also in some of my books), in order that he may be encouraged, exhorted, and instructed, not so much by the sound of your voice, as by the example of your spiritual strength. I desire earnestly, that while his life is yet in the green blade, the tares may be turned into wheat, and he may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by experience the dangers to which he is eager to expose himself. From the poem of my young friend, and my letter to him, your most benevolent and considerate wisdom may perceive my grief, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and care on his account. I am not without hope that, by the Lord's favour, I may through your means be set free from such disquietude regarding him.</p>

<p>As you are now about to read much that I have written, your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> will be much more gratefully esteemed by me, if, moved by compassion, and judging impartially, you correct and reprove whatever displeases you. For you are not one whose oil anointing my head would make me afraid. </p>

<p>The brethren, not those only who dwell with us, and those who, dwelling elsewhere, serve God in the same way as we do, but almost all who are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> our warm friends, send you salutations, along with the expression of their veneration and affectionate longing for you as a brother, as a saint, and as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.  I dare not ask; but if you have any leisure from <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> duties, you may see for what favour all Africa, with myself, is thirsting.</p>
