<h1>Letter 295</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p>To <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>.</p>

<p>I do not think that I need further commend you to God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, after the words that I addressed to you in person. I then bade you adopt the life in common, after the manner of living of the Apostles. This you accepted as wholesome instruction, and gave God thanks for it.</p>

<p>Thus your conduct was due, not so much to the words I spoke, as to my instructions to put them into practice, conducive at once to your advantage who accepted, to my comfort who gave you the advice, and to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and praise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, by Whose name we are called.</p>

<p>For this reason I have sent to you our well-beloved brother, that he may learn of your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, may quicken your sloth, may report to me of opposition. For great is my desire to see you all united in one body, and to hear that you are not content to live a life without <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; but have undertaken to be both watchful of each other's diligence, and witnesses of each other's success.</p>

<p>Thus will each of you receive a reward in full, not only on his own behalf, but also for his brother's progress. And, as is fitting, you will be a source of mutual profit, both by your words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as a result of constant intercourse and exhortation. But above all I exhort you to be mindful of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Fathers, and not to be shaken by those who in your retirement would try to wrest you from it. For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that unless illumined by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, strictness of life avails nothing; nor will a right confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, if void of good works, be able to present you before the Lord.</p>

<p>Faith and works must be joined: so shall the man of God be perfect, and his life not halt through any imperfection.</p>

<p>For the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which saves us, as says the Apostle, is that which works by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>
