<h1>Letter 29</h1>

<h2>He notifies the appointment of his representatives at the Council of Ephesus</h2>

<p> <em>To C&aelig;sar Theodosius, the most religious and devout Augustus Leo pope of the CatholicChurch of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. </em></p>

<p>How much God's <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> vouchsafes to consult for the interests of men is shown by your merciful care which, incited by God's Spirit, is unwilling that there should be any disturbance or difference: since the Faith, which is absolutely one, cannot be different from itself in any thing. Hence although Eutyches, as the minutes of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops'</a> proceeds reveals, has been detected in an <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and unwise <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and ought to have withdrawn from his conviction which is rightly condemned, yet since your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which loves the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Truth with great jealousy for God's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, has determined on a synodal judgment at Ephesus, that that Truth on which he is blind may be brought home to the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> old man; I have sent my brothers Julius the Bishop, Renatus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and my son Hilary the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> to act as my representatives as the matter requires, and they shall bring with them such a spirit of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and kindness that while the whole misguided <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is condemned (for there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to what is the integrity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Faith), yet if he who has gone astray repents and entreats for pardon, he may receive the succour of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> indulgence: seeing that in his appeal  which he sent us, he reserved to himself the right of earning our forgiveness by promising to correct whatever our opinion disapproved of in his opinion. But what the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> universally believes and teaches on the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Lord's Incarnation is contained more fully in the letter which I have sent to my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Flavian. Dated 13th June in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>
