<h1>Letter 29 (A.D. 395)</h1>

<p> <em>A Letter from the Presbyter of the District of Hippo to Alypius the Bishop of Thagaste, Concerning the Anniversary of the Birth of Leontius</em>,  <em>Formerly Bishop of Hippo.</em></p>

<p>1. In the absence of brother Macharius, I have not been able to write anything definite concerning a matter about which I could not feel otherwise than anxious: it is said, however, that he will soon return, and whatever can be with God's help done in the matter shall be done. Although also our brethren, citizens of your town, who were with us, might sufficiently assure you of our solicitude on their behalf when they returned, nevertheless the thing which the Lord has granted to me is one worthy to be the subject of that epistolary intercourse which ministers so much to the comfort of us both; it is, moreover, a thing in the obtaining of which I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that I have been greatly assisted by your own solicitude regarding it, seeing that it could not but constrain you to intercession on our behalf.</p>

<p>2. Therefore let me not fail to relate to your Charity what has taken place; so that, as you joined us in pouring out <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for this mercy before it was obtained, you may now join us in rendering thanks for it after it has been received. When I was informed after your departure that some were becoming openly violent, and declaring that they could not submit to the prohibition (intimated while you were here) of that feast which they call L&aelig;titia, vainly attempting to disguise their revels under a fair name, it happened most opportunely for me, by the hidden fore-ordination of the Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that on the fourth <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day that</p>

<p>Chapter of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> fell to be expounded in ordinary course, in which the words occur: <q>Give not that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111526"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> I discoursed therefore concerning dogs and swine in such a way as to compel those who clamour with obstinate barking against the divine precepts, and who are given up to the abominations of carnal pleasures, to blush for shame; and followed it up by saying, that they might plainly see how criminal it was to do, under the name of religion, within the walls of the church, that which, if it were practised by them in their own houses, would make it necessary for them to be debarred from that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and from the privileges which are the pearls of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>3. Although these words were well received, nevertheless, as few had attended the meeting, all had not been done which so great an emergency required. When, however, this discourse was, according to the ability and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of each, made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> abroad by those who had heard it, it found many opponents. But when the morning of Quadragesima came round, and a great multitude had assembled at the hour of exposition of Scripture, that passage in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was read in which our Lord said, concerning those sellers who were driven out of the temple, and the tables of the money-changers which He had overthrown, that the house of His Father had been made a den of thieves instead of a house of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note111527"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;21:12</a></span> After awakening their attention by bringing forward the subject of immoderate indulgence in wine, I myself also read this chapter, and added to it an argument to prove with how much greater <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and vehemence our Lord would cast forth drunken revels, which are everywhere  disgraceful, from that temple from which He thus drove out merchandise lawful elsewhere, especially when the things sold were those required for the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> appointed in that dispensation; and I asked them whether they regarded a place occupied by men selling what was necessary, or one used by men drinking to excess, as bearing the greater resemblance to a den of thieves.</p>

<p>4. Moreover, as passages of Scripture which I had prepared were held ready to be put into my hands, I went on to say that the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation, with all its lack of spirituality in religion, never held feasts, even temperate feasts, much less feasts disgraced by intemperance, in their temple, in which at that time the body and blood of the Lord were not yet offered, and that in history they are not found to have been excited by wine on any public occasion bearing the name of worship, except when they held a feast before the idol which they had made. <span class="stiki" id="note111528"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;32:6</a></span> While I said these things I took the manuscript from the attendant, and read that whole passage. Reminding them of the words of the apostle, who says, in order to distinguish <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the obdurate <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, that they are his epistle written, not on tables of stone, but on the fleshly tables of the heart, <span class="stiki" id="note111529"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> I asked further, with the deepest sorrow, how it was that, although <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the servant of God broke both the tables of stone because of these rulers of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, I could not break the hearts of those who, though men of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> dispensation, were desiring in their celebration of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days to repeat often the public perpetration of excesses of which the people of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> economy were guilty only once, and that in an act of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</p>

<p>5. Having then given back the manuscript of Exodus, I proceeded to enlarge, so far as my time permitted, on the crime of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, and took up the writings of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, and showed among what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it is classed by him, reading the text, <q>If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one (ye ought) not even to eat;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111530"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:11</a></span> pathetically reminding them how great is our danger in eating with those who are guilty of intemperance even in their own houses. I read also what is added, a little further on, in the same epistle: <q>Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, nor thieves, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and by the Spirit of our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111531"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9-11</a></span> After reading these, I charged them to consider how <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> could hear these words, <q>but you are washed,</q> if they still tolerated in their own hearts&mdash; that is, in God's inner temple&mdash; the abominations of such <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> as these against which the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is shut. Then I went on to that passage: <q>When ye come together into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper: for in eating, every one takes before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken. What! Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in, or despise ye the church of God?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111532"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:20-22</a></span> After reading which, I more especially begged them to remark that not even innocent and temperate feasts were permitted in the church: for the apostle said not, <q>Have ye not houses of your own in which to be drunken?</q>&mdash; as if it was <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> alone which was unlawful in the church; but, <q>Have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?</q>&mdash; things lawful in themselves, but not lawful in the church, inasmuch as men have their own houses in which they may be recruited by necessary food: whereas now, by the corruption of the times and the relaxation of morals, we have been brought so low, that, no longer insisting upon sobriety in the houses of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, all that we venture to demand is, that the realm of tolerated excess be restricted to their own homes.</p>

<p>6. I reminded them also of a passage in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> which I had expounded the day before, in which it is said of the <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>: <q>You shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them by their fruits.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111533"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;7:16</a></span> I also bade them remember that in that place our works are signified by the word fruits. Then I asked among what kind of fruits <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> was named, and read that passage in the Epistle to the Galatians: <q>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, variance, emulations, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, strife, seditions, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, envyings, <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, revellings, and such like; of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111534"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19-21</a></span> After these words, I asked how, when God has commanded that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by their fruits, we could be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> by this fruit of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>? I added also, that we must read what follows there: <q>But the fruit of the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, meekness, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111535"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;5:22-23</a></span> And I pled with them to consider how shameful and lamentable it would be, if, not content with living at home in the practice of these works of the flesh, they even wished by them, forsooth, to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the church, and to fill the whole area of so large a place of worship, if they were permitted, with crowds of revellers and drunkards: and yet would not present to God those fruits of the Spirit which, by the authority of Scripture, and by my groans, they were called to yield, and by the offering of which they would most suitably celebrate the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints'</a> days.</p>

<p>7. This being finished, I returned the manuscript; and being asked to speak,  I set before their eyes with all my might, as the danger itself constrained me, and as the Lord was pleased to give strength, the danger shared by them who were committed to my care, and by me, who must give account to the Chief Shepherd, and implored them by His humiliation, by the unparalleled insults, the buffetings and spitting on the face which He endured, by His pierced hands and crown of thorns, and by His cross and blood, to have pity on me at least, if they were displeased with themselves, and to consider the inexpressible <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> cherished towards me by the aged and venerable Valerius, who had not scrupled to assign to me for their sakes the perilous burden of expounding to them the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and had often told them that in my coming here his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> were answered; not rejoicing, surely, that I had come to share or to behold the death of our hearers, but rejoicing that I had come to share his labours for the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. In conclusion, I told them that I was resolved to trust in Him who cannot lie, and who has given us a promise by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, saying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <q>If His children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes: nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not utterly take from Him.</q>  I declared, therefore, that I put my trust in Him, that if they despised the weighty words which had now been read and spoken to them, He would visit them with the rod and with stripes, and not leave them to be condemned with the world. In this appeal I put forth all the power in thought and utterance which, in an emergency so great and hazardous, our Saviour and Ruler was pleased to supply. I did not move them to weep by first weeping myself; but while these things were being spoken, I own that, moved by the tears which they began to shed, I myself could not refrain from following their example. And when we had thus wept together, I concluded my sermon with full persuasion that they would be restrained by it from the abuses denounced.</p>

<p>8. Next morning, however, when the day dawned, which so many were accustomed to devote to excess in eating and drinking, I received notice that some, even of those who were present when I preached, had not yet desisted from complaint, and that so great was the power of detestable custom with them, that, using no other argument, they asked, <q>Wherefore is this now prohibited? Were they not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who in former times did not interfere with this practice?</q> On hearing this, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not what more powerful means for influencing them I could devise; but resolved, in the event of their judging it proper to persevere, that after reading in Ezekiel's <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> that the watchman has delivered his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> if he has given warning, even though the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> warned refuse to give heed to him, I would shake my garments and depart. But then the Lord showed me that He leaves us not alone, and taught me how He encourages us to trust Him; for before the time at which I had to ascend the pulpit,  the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of whose complaint against interference with long-established custom I had heard came to me. Receiving them kindly, I by a few words brought them round to a right opinion; and when it came to the time for my discourse, having laid aside the lecture which I had prepared as now unnecessary, I said a few things concerning the question mentioned above, <q>Wherefore <em> now</em> prohibit this custom?</q> saying that to those who might propose it the briefest and best answer would be this: <q>Let us now at last put down what ought to have been earlier prohibited.</q></p>

<p>9. Lest, however, any slight should seem to be put by us on those who, before our time, either tolerated or did not dare to put down such manifest excesses of an undisciplined multitude, I explained to them the circumstances out of which this custom seems to have necessarily risen in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash;namely, that when, in the peace which came after such numerous and violent <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, crowds of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> who wished to assume the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> were kept back, because, having been accustomed to celebrate the feasts connected with their worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> in revelling and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, they could not easily refrain from pleasures so hurtful and so habitual, it had seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to our ancestors, making for the time a concession to this infirmity, to permit them to celebrate, instead of the festivals which they renounced, other feasts in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, which were observed, not as before with a profane design, but with similar self-indulgence. I added that now upon them, as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> bound together in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and submissive to the yoke of His august authority, the wholesome restraints of sobriety were laid&mdash; restraints with which the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> due to Him who appointed them should move them to comply&mdash; and that therefore the time had now come in which all who did not dare to cast off the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> profession should begin to walk according to Christ's will; and being now confirmed <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, should reject those concessions to infirmity which were made only for a time in order to their becoming such.</p>

<p>10. I then exhorted them to imitate the example of the churches beyond the sea, in some of which these practices had never been tolerated, while in others they had been already put down by the people complying with the counsel of good <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rulers; and as the examples of daily excess in the use of wine in the church of the blessed Apostle Peter were brought forward in defence of the practice, I said in the first place, that I had heard that these excesses had been often forbidden, but because the place was at a distance from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> control, and because in such a city the multitude of carnally-minded <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> was great, the foreigners especially, of whom there is a constant influx, clinging to that practice with an obstinacy proportioned to their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, the suppression of so great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> had not yet been possible. If, however, I continued, we would <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the Apostle Peter, we ought to hear his words, and look much more to the epistles by which his mind is made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us, than to the place of worship, by which it is not made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; and immediately taking the manuscript, I read his own words: <q>Forasmuch then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, when we walked in lasciviousness, <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111539"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:1-3</a></span> After this, when I saw that all were with one consent turning to a right <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and renouncing the custom against which I had protested, I exhorted them to assemble at noon for the reading of God's word and singing of psalms; stating that we had resolved thus to celebrate the festival in a way much more accordant with purity and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; and that, by the number of worshippers who should assemble for this purpose, it would plainly appear who were guided by reason, and who were the slaves of appetite. With these words the discourse concluded.</p>

<p>11. In the afternoon a greater number assembled than in the forenoon, and there was reading and praise alternately up to the hour at which I went out in company with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>; and after our coming two psalms were read. Then the old man [Valerius] constrained me by his express command to say something to the people; from which I would rather have been excused, as I was longing for the close of the anxieties of the day. I delivered a short discourse in order to express our gratitude to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And as we heard the noise of the feasting, which was going on as usual in the church of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who still prolonged their revelry while we were so differently engaged, I remarked that the beauty of day is enhanced by contrast with the night, and that when anything black is near, the purity of white is the more pleasing; and that, in like manner, our meeting for a spiritual feast might perhaps have been somewhat less sweet to us, but for the contrast of the carnal excesses in which the others indulged; and I exhorted them to desire eagerly such feasts as we then enjoyed, if they had tasted the goodness of the Lord. At the same time, I said that those may well be afraid who seek anything which shall one day be destroyed as the chief object of their desire, seeing that every one shares the portion of that which he worships; a warning expressly given by the apostle to such, when he says of them their <q>god is their belly,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111540"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse19">Philippians&nbsp;3:19</a></span> inasmuch as he has elsewhere said, <q>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111541"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:13</a></span> I added that it is our duty to seek that which is imperishable, which, far removed from carnal affections, is obtained through sanctification of the spirit; and when those things which the Lord was pleased to suggest to me had been spoken on this subject as the occasion required, the daily evening exercises of worship were performed; and when with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> I retired from the church, the brethren said a hymn there, a considerable multitude remaining in the church, and engaging in praise  even till daylight failed.</p>

<p>12. I have thus related as concisely as I could that which I am sure you longed to hear. Pray that God may be pleased to protect our efforts from giving offense or provoking odium in any way. In the tranquil prosperity which you enjoy we do with lively warmth of affection participate in no small measure, when tidings so frequently reach us of the gifts possessed by the highly spiritual church of Thagaste. The ship bringing our brethren has not yet arrived. At Hasna, where our brother Argentius is <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, the Circumcelliones, entering our church, demolished the altar. The case is now in process of trial; and we earnestly ask your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that it may be decided in a peaceful way and as becomes the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so as to silence the tongues of turbulent <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. I have sent a letter to the Asiarch. </p>

<p>Brethren most blessed, may you persevere in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and remember us. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
