<h1>Letter 2</h1>

<p> <em>For 330. Easter-day xxiv Pharmuthi; xiii Kal. Mai; &AElig;ra Dioclet. 46; Coss. Gallicianus, Valerius Symmachus; Pr&aelig;fect, Magninianus; Indict. iii.</em></p>

<p>Again, my brethren, is <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> come and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>; again the Lord has brought us to this season; so that when, according to custom, we have been nourished with His words, we may duly keep the feast. Let us celebrate it then, even heavenly <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, with those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who formerly proclaimed a like feast, and were ensamples to us of conversation in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For not only were they entrusted with the charge of preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, but, if we enquire, we shall see, as it is written, that its power was displayed in them. 'Be therefore followers of me <span class="stiki" id="note283930"><a href="../bible/1co004.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:16</a></span>,' he wrote to the Corinthians. Now the apostolic precept exhorts us all, for those commands which he sent to individuals, he at the same time enjoined upon every man in every place, for he was 'a teacher of all nations in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. ' And, generally, the commands of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> urge us on similarly, as Solomon makes use of proverbs, saying, 'Hear, my children, the instruction of a father, and attend to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> understanding; for I give you a good gift, forsake not my word: for I was an <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> son to my father, and beloved in the sight of my mother <span class="stiki" id="note283932"><a href="../bible/pro004.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;4:1</a></span>.' For a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> father brings up [his children] well, when he is diligent in teaching others in accordance with his own upright conduct, so that when he meets with opposition, he may not be ashamed on hearing it said, 'You therefore that teachest others, do you not teach yourself?' <span class="stiki" id="note283933"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;2:21</a></span> but rather, like the good servant, may both save himself and gain others; and thus, when the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> committed to him has been doubled, he may hear, 'You good and faithful servant, you have been faithful in a little, I will set you over much: enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your Lord <span class="stiki" id="note283934"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;25:21</a></span>.'</p>

<p>2. Let us  then, as is becoming, as at all times, yet especially in the days of the feast, be not hearers only, but doers of the commandments of our Saviour; that having imitated the behaviour of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, we may enter together into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of our Lord which is in heaven, which is not transitory, but <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> abides; of which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doers having deprived themselves, there remains to them as the fruit of their ways, sorrow and affliction, and groaning with torments. Let a man see what these become like, that they bear not the likeness  of the conversation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, nor of that right understanding, by which man at the beginning was rational, and in the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But they are compared to their disgrace to beasts without understanding, and becoming like them in unlawful pleasures, they are spoken of as wanton horses <span class="stiki" id="note283937"><a href="../bible/jer005.htm#verse8">Jeremiah&nbsp;5:8</a></span>; also, for their craftiness, and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> laden with death, they are called a 'generation of vipers,' as John says.  Now having thus fallen, and grovelling in the dust like the serpent , having their minds set on nothing beyond visible things, they esteem these things good, and rejoicing in them, serve their own <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and not God.</p>

<p>3. Yet even in this state, the man-loving Word, who came for this very reason, that He might seek and find that which was lost, sought to restrain them from such folly, crying and saying, 'Be not as the horse and the mule which have no understanding, whose cheeks you hold in with bit and bridle. ' Because they were careless and imitated the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> in spirit and says, 'You are to me like merchant-men of Ph&oelig;nicia. ' And the avenging Spirit protests against them in these words, 'Lord, in Your city You will despise their image. ' Thus, being changed into the likeness of fools, they fell so low in their understanding, that by their excessive reasoning, they even likened the Divine Wisdom to themselves, thinking it to be like their own arts. Therefore, 'professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the incorruptible God into the likeness of the corruptible image of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, and birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God gave them over to a reprobate <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to do those things which are not convenient. ' For they did not listen to the prophetic voice that reproved them (saying), 'To what have you likened the Lord, and with what have you compared Him <span class="stiki" id="note283944"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;40:18</a></span>?' neither to David, who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> concerning such as these, and sang, 'All those that make them are like them, and all those who put their trust in them. ' Being blind to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they looked upon a stone as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hence, like senseless creatures, they walked in darkness, and, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> cried, 'They hear indeed, but they do not understand; they see indeed, but they do not perceive; for their heart is waxen fat, and with their ears they hear heavily <span class="stiki" id="note283946"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;6:9</a></span>.'</p>

<p>4. Now those who do not observe the feast, continue such as these even to the present day, feigning indeed and devising names of feasts , but rather introducing days of mourning than of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>; 'For there is no peace to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, says the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note283948"><a href="../bible/isa048.htm#verse22">Isaiah&nbsp;48:22</a></span>.' And as Wisdom says, 'Gladness and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> are taken from their mouth. ' Such are the feasts of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. But the wise servants of the Lord, who have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> put on the man which is created in God <span class="stiki" id="note283950"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse24">Ephesians&nbsp;4:24</a></span>, have received gospel words, and reckon as a general commandment that given to Timothy, which says, 'Be an example to the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in word, in conversation, in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in purity <span class="stiki" id="note283951"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:12</a></span>.' So well do they keep the Feast, that even the unbelievers, seeing their order , may say, 'God is with them of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283953"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:25</a></span>.' For as he who receives an apostle receives Him who sent him <span class="stiki" id="note283954"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;10:40</a></span>, so he who is a follower of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, makes the Lord in every respect his end and aim, even as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, being a follower of Him, goes on to say, 'As I also of Christ <span class="stiki" id="note283955"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:1</a></span>.' For there were first our Saviour's own words, who from the height of His divinity, when conversing with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, said, 'Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you shall find rest to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283956"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;11:29</a></span>.' Then too when He poured water into a basin, and girded Himself with a towel, and washed His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples'</a> feet, He said to them, 'Know what I have done. You call Me Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If therefore I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet: for I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, you also should do <span class="stiki" id="note283957"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;13:12</a></span>.'</p>

<p>5. Oh! My brethren, how shall we admire the loving-kindness of the Saviour? With what power, and with what a trumpet should a man cry out, exalting these His benefits! That not only should we bear His image, but should receive from Him an example and pattern of heavenly conversation; that as He has begun, we should go on, that suffering, we should not threaten, being reviled, we should not revile again, but should bless them that curse, and in everything commit ourselves to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who judges righteously.  For those who are thus disposed, and fashion themselves according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, will be partakers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and imitators of apostolic conversation, on account of which they shall be deemed worthy of that praise from him, with which he praised the Corinthians, when he said, 'I praise you that in everything you are mindful of me <span class="stiki" id="note283959"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span>.' Afterwards, because there were men who used his words, but chose to hear them as suited their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and dared to pervert them, as the followers of Hymen&aelig;us and Alexander, and before them the <a href="../cathen/13323a.htm">Sadducees</a>, who as he said, 'having made shipwreck of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,' scoffed at the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the resurrection, he immediately proceeded to say, 'And as I have delivered to you traditions, hold them fast. ' That means, indeed, that we should think not otherwise than as the teacher has delivered.</p>

<p>6. For not only in outward form did those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men dissemble, putting on as the Lord says sheep's clothing, and appearing like whited sepulchres; but they took those divine words in their mouth, while they inwardly cherished <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> intentions. And the first to put on this appearance was the serpent, the inventor of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> from the beginning&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>&mdash;who, in disguise, conversed with Eve, and immediately deceived her. But after him and with him are all inventors of unlawful <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, who indeed refer to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, but do not hold such opinions as the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have handed down, and receiving them as the traditions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, because they do not rightly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them nor their <span class="stiki" id="note283961"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;22:29</a></span> power. Therefore <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> praises the Corinthians <span class="stiki" id="note283962"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span>, because their opinions were in accordance with his traditions. And the Lord most righteously reproved the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, saying, 'Wherefore do you also transgress the commandments of God on account of your traditions <span class="stiki" id="note283963"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;15:3</a></span>.' For they changed the commandments they received from God after their own understanding, preferring to observe the traditions of men. And about these, a little after, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> again gave directions to the Galatians who were in danger thereof, writing to them, 'If any man preach to you anything else than that you have received, let him be accursed <span class="stiki" id="note283964"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;1:9</a></span>.'</p>

<p>7. For there is no fellowship whatever between the words of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the fancies of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> invention; for the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> are the ministers of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, preaching the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, but those who are borne in the opposite direction have nothing better than to eat, and think their end is that they shall cease to be, and they say, 'Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die <span class="stiki" id="note283965"><a href="../bible/isa022.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;22:13</a></span>.' Therefore blessed Luke reproves the inventions of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and hands down the narrations of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, saying in the beginning of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, 'Since many have presumed to write narrations of those events of which we are assured, as those who from the beginning were witnesses and ministers of the Word have delivered to us; it has seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to me also, who have adhered to them all from the first, to write correctly in order to you, O excellent Theophilus, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> concerning the things in which you have been instructed <span class="stiki" id="note283966"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse1">Luke&nbsp;1:1</a></span>.' For as each of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> has received, that they impart without alteration, for the confirmation of the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. Of these the (divine) word would have us <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and these should of right be our teachers, and to them only is it necessary to give heed, for of them only is 'the word faithful and worthy of all acceptation <span class="stiki" id="note283967"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:15</a></span>;' these not being <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> because they heard from others, but being eye-witnesses and ministers of the Word, that which they had heard from Him have they handed down.</p>

<p>Now some have related the wonderful signs performed by our Saviour, and preached His <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> Godhead. And others have written of His being born in the flesh of the Virgin, and have proclaimed the festival of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> passover, saying, 'Christ our <a href="../cathen/08755a.htm">Passover</a> is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283968"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span>;' so that we, individually and collectively, and all the churches in the world may remember, as it is written, 'That Christ rose from the dead, of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, according to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283969"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:8</a></span>.' And let us not forget that which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> delivered, declaring it to the Corinthians; I mean His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, whereby 'He destroyed him that had the power of death, that is, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283970"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;2:14</a></span>;' and raised us up together with Him, having loosed the bands of death, and vouchsafed a blessing instead of a curse, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> instead of grief, a feast instead of mourning, in this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, which being continually in our hearts, we always <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> commanded; 'We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing; in everything we give thanks <span class="stiki" id="note283971"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:17</a></span>.' So we are not remiss in giving notice of its seasons, as we have received from the Fathers. Again we write, again keeping to the apostolic traditions, we remind each other when we come together for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and keeping the feast in common, with one mouth we <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> give thanks to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Thus giving thanks unto Him, and being followers of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, 'we shall make our praise in the Lord all the day ,' as the Psalmist says. So, when we rightly keep the feast, we shall be counted worthy of that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is in heaven.</p>

<p>8. We begin the fast of forty days on the 13th of the month Phamenoth <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm">Mark 9</a></span>. After we have given ourselves to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> in continued succession, let us begin the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Paschal  week on the 18th of the month Pharmuthi (April 13). Then resting on the 23rd of the same month Pharmuthi (April 18), and keeping the feast afterwards on the first of the week, on the 24th (April 19), let us add to these the seven weeks of the great Pentecost, wholly rejoicing and exulting in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, through Whom to the Father be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>The brethren which are with me salute you. Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. </p>

<p>Here ends the second Festal Letter of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lord Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria.</p>
