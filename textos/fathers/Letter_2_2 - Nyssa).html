<h1>Letter 2</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. GREGORY OF NYSSA</em></strong></p>

<p> <em>To the City of Sebasteia</em> </p>

<p>Some of the brethren whose heart is as our heart told us of the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> that were being propagated to our detriment by those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> peace, and privily backbite their neighbour; and have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the great and terrible judgment-seat of Him Who has declared that account will be required even of idle words in that trial of our life which we must all look for: they say that the charges which are being circulated against us are such as these; that we entertain opinions opposed to those who at Nic&aelig;a set forth the right and sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that without due discrimination and inquiry we received into the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> those who formerly assembled at Ancyra under the name of Marcellus. Therefore, that <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> may not overpower the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in another letter we made a sufficient defence against the charges levelled at us, and before the Lord we protested that we had neither departed from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Holy Fathers, nor had we done anything without due discrimination and inquiry in the case of those who came over from the communion of Marcellus to that of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: but all that we did we did only after the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> in the East, and our brethren in the ministry had entrusted to us the consideration of the case of these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, and had approved our action. But inasmuch as, since we composed that written defence of our conduct, again some of the brethren who are of one mind with us begged us to make separately  with our own lips a profession of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which we entertain with full conviction , following as we do the utterances of inspiration and the tradition of the Fathers, we deemed it necessary to discourse briefly of these heads as well. We confess that the doctrine of the Lord, which He taught His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, when He delivered to them the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of godliness, is the foundation and root of right and sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, nor do we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is anything else loftier or safer than that tradition. Now the doctrine of the Lord is this: <q>Go,</q> He said, <q>teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> Since, then, in the case of those who are regenerate from death to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, it is through the Holy Trinity that the life-giving power is bestowed on those who with <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are deemed worthy of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and in like manner the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is imperfect, if any one, whichever it be, of the names of the Holy Trinity be omitted in the saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash; for the sacrament of regeneration   is not completed in the Son and the Father alone without the Spirit: nor is the perfect boon of life imparted to Baptism in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if the name of the Son be suppressed: nor is the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of that Resurrection accomplished in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, if the Spirit be left out :&mdash; for this reason we rest all our <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a>, and the persuasion of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, upon the three Persons, recognized  by these names; and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, Who is the Fountain of life, and in the Only-begotten Son of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, Who is the Author of life, as says the Apostle, and in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, concerning Whom the Lord has spoken, <q>It is the Spirit that quickens</q>. And since on us who have been redeemed from death the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> is bestowed, as we have said, through <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, guided by these we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that nothing servile, nothing created, nothing unworthy of the majesty of the Father is to be associated in thought with the Holy Trinity; since, I say, our life is one which comes to us by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Holy Trinity, taking its rise from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, flowing through the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and working in us by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. Having, then, this full assurance, we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> as we were commanded, and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> as we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and we hold as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; so that with one accord our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and our ascription of praise are to  the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But if any one makes mention of two or three Gods, or of three God-heads, let him be accursed. And if any, following the perversion of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, says that the Son or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> were produced from things that are not, let him be accursed. But as many as walk by the rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and acknowledge the three Persons, devoutly recognized in Their several properties, and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that there is one Godhead, one goodness, one rule, one authority and power, and neither make void the supremacy of the Sole-sovereignty , nor fall away into <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>, nor confound the Persons, nor make up the Holy Trinity of heterogeneous and unlike elements, but in simplicity receive the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, grounding all their hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> upon the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>&mdash;these according to our judgment are of the same mind as we, and with them we also trust to have part in the Lord.</p>
