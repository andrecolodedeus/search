<h1>Letter 2</h1>

<p><strong>To Theodosius and the Rest of the Anchorites</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Written from <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, 374 A.D., while Jerome was still in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to his future course. Theodosius appears to have been the head of the solitaries in the Syrian Desert.</span> </p>

<p>How I long to be a member of your company, and with uplifting of all my powers to embrace your admirable community! Though, indeed, these poor eyes are not worthy to look upon it. Oh! That I could behold the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, lovelier to me than any city! Oh! That I could see those lonely spots made into a paradise by the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that throng them! But since my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> prevent me from thrusting into your blessed company a head laden with every transgression, I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you (and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you can do it) by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to deliver me from the darkness of this world. I spoke of this when I was with you, and now in writing to you I repeat anew the same request; for all the energy of my mind is devoted to this one object. It rests with you to give effect to my resolve. I have the will but not the power; this last can only come in answer to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. For my part, I am like a sick sheep astray from the flock. Unless the good Shepherd shall place me on his shoulders and carry me back to the fold, <span class="stiki" id="note300020"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;15:3-5</a></span> my steps will totter, and in the very effort of rising I shall find my feet give way. I am the prodigal son <span class="stiki" id="note300021"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse11">Luke&nbsp;15:11-32</a></span> who although I have squandered all the portion entrusted to me by my father, have not yet bowed the knee in submission to him; not yet have I commenced to put away from me the allurements of my former excesses. And because it is only a little while since I have begun not so much to abandon my <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> as to desire to abandon them, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> now ensnares me in new toils, he puts new stumbling-blocks in my path, he encompasses me on every side.</p>

<blockquote><p>The seas around, and all around the main. </p></blockquote>

<p>I find myself in mid-ocean, unwilling to retreat and unable to advance. It only remains that your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> should win for me the gale of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to waft me to the haven upon the desired shore.</p>
