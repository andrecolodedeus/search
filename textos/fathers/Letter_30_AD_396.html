<h1>Letter 30 (A.D. 396)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">This letter of <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a> was written before receiving a reply to his former letter, No. 27, p. 248.</span> </p>

<p> <em>To Augustine, Our Lord and Holy and Beloved Brother, <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Paulinus</a> and Therasia, Sinners, Send Greeting.</em></p>

<p>1. My beloved brother in Christ the Lord, having through your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> works come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you without your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and to see you though absent long ago, my mind embraced you with unreserved affection, and I hastened to secure the gratification of hearing you through familiar brotherly exchange of letters. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also that by the Lord's hand and favour my letter has reached you; but as the youth whom, before winter, we had sent to salute you and others equally loved in God's name, has not returned, we could no longer either put off what we feel to be our duty, or restrain the vehemence of our desire to hear from you. If, then, my former letter has been found worthy to reach you, this is the second; if, however, it was not so fortunate as to come to your hand, accept this as the first.</p>

<p>2. But, my brother, judging all things as a spiritual man, do not estimate our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to you by the duty which we render, or the frequency of our letters. For the Lord, who everywhere, as one and the same, works His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in His own, is <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that, from the time when, by the kindness of the venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Aurelius and Alypius, we came to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you through your writings against the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for you has taken such a place in us, that we seemed not so much to be acquiring a new friendship as reviving an old affection. Now at length we address you in writing; and though we are novices in expressing, we are not novices in feeling <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to you; and by communion of the spirit, which is the inner man, we are as it were acquainted with you. Nor is it strange that though distant we are near, though unknown we are well known to each other; for we are members of one body, having one Head, enjoying the effusion of the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, living by the same bread, walking in the same way, and dwelling in the same home. In short, in all that makes up our being&mdash;in the whole <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope by which we stand in the present life, or labour for that which is to come&mdash;we are both in the spirit and in the body of Christ so united, that if we fell from this union we would cease to be.</p>

<p>3. How small a thing, therefore, is that which our bodily separation denies to us!&mdash; for it is nothing more than one of those fruits that gratify the eyes, which are occupied only with the things of time. And yet, perhaps, we should not number this pleasure which in the body we enjoy among the blessings which are only in time the portion of spiritual men, to whose bodies the resurrection will impart <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>; as we, though in ourselves unworthy, are bold to expect, through the merit of Christ and the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. Wherefore I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> may grant unto us this favour too, that we may yet see your face. Not only would this bring great gratification to our desires; but by it illumination would be brought to our minds, and our poverty would be enriched by your abundance. This indeed you may grant to us even while we are absent from you, especially on the present occasion, through our sons Romanus and Agilis, beloved and most dear to us in the Lord (whom as our second selves we commend to you), when they return to us in the Lord's name, after fulfilling the labour of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in which they are engaged; in which work we beg that they may especially enjoy the goodwill of your Charity. For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what high rewards the Most High promises to the brother who gives his brother help. If you are pleased to impart to me any gift of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that has been bestowed on you, you may safely do it through them; for, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, they are of one heart and of one mind with us in the Lord. May the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God always abide as it is with you, O brother beloved, venerable, most dear, and longed for in Christ the Lord! Salute on our behalf all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in Christ who are with you, for doubtless such attach themselves to your fellowship; commend us to them all, that they may, along with yourself, remember us in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>.</p>
