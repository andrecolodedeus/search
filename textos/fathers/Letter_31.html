<h1>Letter 31</h1>

<p> <em>To Domnus Bishop of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>.</em> </p>

<p>The most admirable and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Celestinianus is a native of the famous <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and of an illustrious <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in that city. Now he has been exiled from it. He is wandering in foreign parts, and has to look to the benevolence of them that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> God. He carries with him a burden from which he cannot escape and which increases his care&mdash; I mean his wife, his children and his servants, for whom he is at great expense. I wonder at his spirit. For he praises the great Pilot as though he were being borne by favourable breezes, and cares nothing for the terrible storm. From his calamity he has reaped the fruit of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and this thrice blessed gain has been brought him by his misfortune; for while he was in prosperity he never accepted this teaching, but when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> day left him bare, among the rest of his losses he lost his impiety too, and now possesses the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and for its sake thinks little of his ruin.</p>

<p>I therefore beseech your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to let him find a fatherland in these foreign parts, and to charge them that abound in riches to comfort one who once was endowed like themselves, and to scatter the dark cloud of his calamity. It is only right and proper that among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of like nature, where all have erred, they that have escaped chastisement should bring comfort to them that have fallen on <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> days, and by their sympathy for these latter propitiate the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
