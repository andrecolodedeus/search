<h1>Letter 31</h1>

<p><strong>To Eustochium</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Jerome writes to thank <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> for some presents sent to him by her on the festival of St. Peter. He also moralizes on the mystical meaning of the articles sent. The letter should be compared with Letter XLIV., of which the theme is similar. Written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 384 A.D. (on St. Peter's Day).</span> </p>

<p>1. Doves, bracelets, and a letter are outwardly but small gifts to receive from a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, but the action which has prompted them enhances their value. And since honey may not be offered in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300728"><a href="../bible/lev002.htm#verse11">Leviticus&nbsp;2:11</a></span> you have shown skill in taking off their overmuch sweetness and making them pungent&mdash; if I may so say&mdash; with a dash of pepper. For nothing that is simply pleasurable or merely sweet can please God. Everything must have in it a sharp seasoning of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Christ's passover must be eaten with bitter herbs. <span class="stiki" id="note300729"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse8">Exodus&nbsp;12:8</a></span> </p>

<p>2. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that a festival such as the birthday  of Saint Peter should be seasoned with more <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> than usual; still our merriment must not forget the limit set by Scripture, and we must not stray too far from the boundary of our wrestling-ground. Your presents, indeed, remind me of the sacred volume, for in it Ezekiel decks Jerusalem with bracelets, <span class="stiki" id="note300731"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse11">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:11</a></span> Baruch receives letters from Jeremiah,  and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> descends in the form of a dove at the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300733"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;3:16</a></span> But to give you, too, a sprinkling of pepper and to remind you of my former letter,  I send you today this three-fold warning. Cease not to adorn yourself with good works&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bracelets of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300735"><a href="../bible/1ti002.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:10</a></span> Rend not the letter written on your heart <span class="stiki" id="note300736"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> as the profane king cut with his penknife that delivered to him by Baruch. <span class="stiki" id="note300737"><a href="../bible/jer036.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;36:23</a></span> Let not Hosea say to you as to Ephraim, <q>You are like a silly dove.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300738"><a href="../bible/hos007.htm#verse11">Hosea&nbsp;7:11</a></span> </p>

<p>My words are too harsh, you will say, and hardly suitable to a festival like the present. If so, you have provoked me to it by the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of your own gifts. So long as you put bitter with sweet, you must expect the same from me, sharp words that is, as well as praise.</p>

<p>3. However, I do not wish to make light of your gifts, least of all the basket of fine cherries, blushing with such a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> modesty that I can fancy them freshly gathered by Lucullus  himself. For it was he who first introduced the fruit at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> after his conquest of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> and Armenia; and the cherry tree is so called because he brought it from Cerasus. Now as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> do not mention cherries, but do speak of a basket of figs, <span class="stiki" id="note300740"><a href="../bible/jer024.htm#verse1">Jeremiah&nbsp;24:1-3</a></span> I will use these instead to point my moral. May you be made of fruits such as those which grow before God's temple and of which He says, <q>Behold they are good, very good.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300741"><a href="../bible/jer024.htm#verse3">Jeremiah&nbsp;24:3</a></span> The Saviour likes nothing that is half and half, and, while he welcomes the hot and does not shun the cold, he tells us in the Apocalypse that he will spew the lukewarm out of his mouth. <span class="stiki" id="note300742"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse15">Revelation&nbsp;3:15-16</a></span> Wherefore we must be careful to celebrate our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> day not so much with abundance of food as with exultation of spirit. For it is altogether unreasonable to wish to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> by excess who himself, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, pleased God by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. When you take food always recollect that eating should be followed by reading, and also by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. And if, by taking this course, you displease some, repeat to yourself the words of the Apostle: <q>If I yet pleased men I should not be the servant of Christ</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300743"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;1:10</a></span> </p>
