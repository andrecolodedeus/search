<h1>Letter 31 (A.D. 396)</h1>

<p> <em>To <a href="../cathen/11585b.htm">Brother Paulinus</a> and to Sister Therasia, Most Beloved and Sincere, Truly Most Blessed and Most Eminent for the Very Abundant Grace of God Bestowed on Them Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. Although in my longing to be without delay near you in one sense, while still remote in another, I wished much that what I wrote in answer to your former letter (if, indeed, any letter of mine deserves to be called an answer to yours) should go with all possible expedition to your Grace,  my delay has brought me the advantage of a second letter from you. The Lord is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, who often withholds what we desire, that He may add to it what we would prefer. For it is one pleasure to me that you will write me on receiving my letter, and it is another that, through not receiving it at once, you have written now. The <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which I have felt in reading this letter would have been lost to me if my letter to your Holiness had been quickly conveyed to you, as I intended and earnestly desired. But now, to have this letter, and to expect a reply to my own, multiplies my satisfaction. The blame of the delay cannot be laid to my charge; and the Lord, in His more abundant kindness, has done that which He judged to be more conducive to my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>.</p>

<p>2. We welcomed with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in the Lord the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brothers Romanus and Agilis, who were, so to speak, an additional letter from you, capable of hearing and answering our voices, whereby most agreeably your presence was in part enjoyed by us, although only to make us long the more eagerly to see you. It would be at all times and in every way impossible for you to give, and unreasonable for us to ask, as much information from you concerning yourself by letter as we received from them by word of mouth. There was manifest also in them (what no paper could convey) such delight in telling us of you, that by their very countenance and eyes while they spoke, we could with unspeakable <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> read you written on their hearts. Moreover, a sheet of paper, of whatever kind it be, and however excellent the things written upon it may be, enjoys no benefit itself from what it contains, though it may be unfolded with great benefit to others; but, in reading this letter of yours&mdash; namely, the minds of these brethren&mdash; when conversing with them, we found that the blessedness of those upon whom you had written was manifestly proportioned to the fullness with which they had been written upon by you. In order, therefore, to attain to the same blessedness, we transcribed in our own hearts what was written in theirs, by most eager questioning as to everything concerning you.</p>

<p>3. Notwithstanding all this, it is with deep regret that we consent to their so soon leaving us, even to return to you. For observe, I beseech you, the conflicting emotions by which we are agitated. Our obligation to let them go without delay was increased according to the vehemence of their desire to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> you; but the greater the vehemence of this desire in them, the more completely did they set you forth as almost present with us, because they let us see how tender your affections are. Therefore our reluctance to let them go increased with our sense of the reasonableness of their urgency to be permitted to go. Oh insupportable trial, were it not that by such partings we are not, after all, separated from each other&mdash;were it not that we are <q>members of one body, having one Head, enjoying the effusion of the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, living by the same bread, walking in the same way, and dwelling in the same home!</q>  You recognise these words, I suppose, as quoted from your own letter; and why should not I also use them? Why should they be yours any more than mine, seeing that, inasmuch as they are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, they proceed from communion with the same head? And in so far as they contain something that has been specially given to you, I have so loved them the more on that account, that they have taken possession of the way leading through my breast, and would suffer no words to pass from my heart to my tongue until they went first, with the priority which is due to them as yours. My brother and sister, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and beloved in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, members of the same body with us, who could <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that we are animated by one spirit, except those who are strangers to that affection by which we are bound to each other?</p>

<p>4. Yet I am curious to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you bear with more patience and ease than I do this bodily separation. If it be so, I do not, I confess, take any pleasure in your <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in this respect, unless perhaps because of its reasonableness, seeing that I confess myself much less worthy of your affectionate longing than you are of mine. At all events, if I found in myself a power of bearing your absence patiently, this would displease me, because it would make me relax my efforts to see you; and what could be more absurd than to be made indolent by power of endurance? But I beg to acquaint your Charity with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> duties by which I am kept at home, inasmuch as the blessed father Valerius (who with me salutes you, and thirsts for you with a vehemence of which you will hear from our brethren), not content with having me as his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, has insisted upon adding the greater burden of sharing the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> with him. This office I was afraid to decline, being persuaded, through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Valerius and the importunity of the people, that it was the Lord's will, and being precluded from excusing myself on other grounds by some precedents of similar appointments. The yoke of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is in itself easy, and His burden light; <span class="stiki" id="note111546"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;11:30</a></span> yet, through my perversity and infirmity, I may find the yoke vexatious and the burden heavy in some degree; and I cannot tell how much more easy and light my yoke and burden would become if I were comforted by a visit from you, who live, as I am informed, more disengaged and free from such cares.  I therefore feel warranted in asking, nay, demanding and imploring you to condescend to come over into Africa, which is more oppressed with thirst for men such as you are than even by the well-known aridity of her soil. </p>

<p>5. God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that I long for your visiting this country, not merely to gratify my own desire, nor merely on account of those who through me, or by public report, have heard of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> resolution;  I long for it for the sake of others also who either have not heard, or, hearing, have not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the fame of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, but who might be constrained to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> excellence of which they could then be no longer in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. For although the perseverance and purity of your compassionate benevolence is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, more is required of you; namely, <q>Let your light so shine before men, that they may behold your good works, and may glorify your Father which is in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111550"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span> The fishermen of <a href="../cathen/06341c.htm">Galilee</a> found pleasure not only in leaving their ships and their nets at the Lord's command, but also in declaring that they had left all and followed Him. <span class="stiki" id="note111551"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;19:27</a></span> And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> he despises all who despises not only all that he was able, but also all that he was desirous to possess. What may have been desired is seen only by the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; what was actually possessed is seen also by the eyes of men. Moreover, when things trivial and earthly are loved by us, we are somehow more firmly wedded to what we have than to what we desire to have. For whence was it that he who sought from the Lord counsel as to the way of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, went away sorrowful upon hearing that, if he would be perfect, he must sell all, and distribute to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and have treasure in heaven, unless because, as the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> tells us, he had great possessions? <span class="stiki" id="note111552"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;18:22-23</a></span> For it is one thing to forbear from appropriating what is wanting to us; it is another thing to rend away that which has become a part of ourselves: the former action is like declining food, the latter is like cutting off a limb. How great and how full of wonder is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> with which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity beholds in our day a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> cheerfully made in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which that rich man grieved and refused to make at the bidding of Christ Himself!</p>

<p>6. Although language fails to express that which my heart has conceived and labours to utter, nevertheless, since you perceive with your discernment and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of this is not yours, that is to say, not of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord in you (for you yourselves are most carefully on your guard against your Adversary, and most devoutly strive to be found as learners of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, meek and lowly in heart; and, indeed, it were better with humility to retain than with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to renounce this world's <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>)&mdash;since, I say, you are aware that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> here is not yours, but the Lord's, you see how weak and inadequate are the things which I have spoken. For I have been speaking of the praises of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, a theme transcending the tongue of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. We long to see this <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of Christ brought near to the eyes of our people; that in you, united in the bonds of wedlock, there may be given to both sexes an example of the way in which <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> must be trodden under foot, and perfection hopefully pursued. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not any way in which you could give greater <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of your benevolence, than in resolving to be not less willing to permit your worth to be seen, than you are <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> to acquire and retain it.</p>

<p>7. I recommend to your kindness and charity this boy Vetustinus, whose case might draw forth the sympathy even of those who are not religious: the causes of his affliction and of his leaving  his country you will hear from his own lips. As to his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> resolution&mdash; his promise, namely, to devote himself to the service of God&mdash; it will be more decisively <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> after some time has elapsed, when his strength has been confirmed, and his present <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> is removed. Perceiving the warmth of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for me, and encouraged thereby to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that you will not grudge the labour of reading what I have written, I send to your Holiness and Charity three books: would that the size of the volumes were an index of the completeness of the discussion of so great a subject; for the question of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a> is handled in them! I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these books, or at least some of them, are not in the possession of our brother Romanianus; but almost everything which I have been able for the benefit of any readers to write is, as I have intimated, accessible to your perusal through him, because of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to me, although I did not charge him to carry them to you. For he already had them all, and was carrying them with him: moreover, it was by him that my answer to your first letter was sent. I suppose that your Holiness has already discovered, by that spiritual sagacity which the Lord has given you, how much that man bears in his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and how far he still comes short through infirmity. In the letter sent through him you have, as I trust, read with what anxiety I commended himself and his son to your sympathy and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, as well as how close is the bond by which they are united to me. May the Lord build them up by your means! This must be asked from Him rather than from you, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much it is already your desire.</p>

<p>8. I have heard from the brethren that you are writing a treatise against the Pagans: if we have any claim on your heart, send it at once to us to read. For your heart is such an oracle of divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that we expect from it answers which shall satisfactorily and clearly decide the most prolix debates. I understand that your Holiness has the books of the most blessed father  Ambrose, of which I long greatly to see those which, with much care and at great length, he has written against some most <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and pretentious men, who affirm that our Lord was instructed by the writings of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>. </p>

<p>9. Our most blessed brother Severus, formerly of our community, now president  of the church in Milevis, and well known by the brethren in that city, joins me in respectful salutation to your Holiness. The brethren also who are with me serving the Lord salute you as warmly as they long to see you: they long for you as much as they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you; and they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you as your eminent goodness merits. The loaf which we send you will become more rich as a blessing through the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with which your kindness receives it. May the Lord keep you for ever from this generation,  my brother and sister most beloved and sincere, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> benevolent, and most eminently endowed with abundant <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from the Lord.</p>
