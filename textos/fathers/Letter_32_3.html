<h1>Letter 32</h1>

<h2>He acknowledges their zeal and refers them to the Tome</h2>

<p>To his well-beloved sons Faustus, Martinus, and the rest of the archimandrites, Leo the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. </p>

<p>As on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which Eutyches has tried to disturb, I was sending legates <em>de latere</em>  to assist the defence of the Truth, I thought it fitting that I should address a letter to you also, beloved: whom I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> for certain to be so <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of religion that you can by no means listen calmly to such <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and profane utterances: for the Apostle's command lingers in your hearts, in which it is said, <q>If any man has preached unto you any gospel other than that which he received, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360328"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse9">Galatians&nbsp;1:9</a></span> .</q> And we also decide that the opinion of the said Eutyches is to be rejected, which, as we have learned from perusing the proceedings, has been deservedly condemned: so that, if its foolish maintainer will abide by his perverseness, he may have fellowship with those whose <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> he has followed. For one who says that Christ had not a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, that is our, nature, is deservedly put out of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Church. But, if he be corrected through the pity of God's Spirit and acknowledge his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, so as to condemn unreservedly what <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> reject, we wish him not to be denied mercy, that the Lord's Church may suffer no loss: for the repentant can always be readmitted, it is only <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> that must be shut out. Upon the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of great godliness , whereby through the Incarnation of the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> comes our justification and redemption, what is our opinion, drawn from the tradition of the fathers, is now sufficiently explained according to my judgment in the letter which I have sent to our brother Flavian the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> : so that through the declaration of your chief you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what, according to the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, we desire to be fixed in the hearts of all the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Dated 13th June, in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>
