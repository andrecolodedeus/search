<h1>Letter 33</h1>

<p><strong>To Paula</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">A fragment of a letter in which Jerome institutes a comparison between the industry as writers of M. T. Varro and <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. It is noteworthy as passing an unqualified eulogium upon <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, which contrasts strongly with the tone adopted by the writer in subsequent years (see, e.g., Letter LXXXIV.). Its date is probably 384 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. Antiquity marvels at Marcus Terentius Varro,  because of the countless books which he wrote for Latin readers; and Greek writers are extravagant in their praise of their man of brass,  because he has written more works than one of us could so much as copy. But since Latin ears would find a list of Greek writings tiresome, I shall confine myself to the Latin Varro. I shall try to show that we of today are sleeping the sleep of Epimenides,  and devoting to the amassing of riches the energy which our predecessors gave to sound, if secular, learning.</p>

<p>2. Varro's writings include forty-five books of antiquities, four concerning the life of the Roman people.</p>

<p>3. But why, you ask me, have I thus mentioned Varro and the man of brass? Simply to bring to your notice our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man of brass, or, rather, man of adamant &mdash; <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, I mean&mdash; whose <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the study of Scripture has fairly earned for him this latter name. Would you learn what monuments of his genius he has left us? The following list exhibits them. His writings comprise thirteen books on Genesis, two books of Mystical Homilies, notes on Exodus, notes on Leviticus, * * * * also single books,  four books on First Principles, two books on the Resurrection, two dialogues on the same subject. </p>

<p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>4. So, you see, the labors of this one man have surpassed those of all previous writers, Greek and Latin. Who has ever managed to read all that he has written? Yet what reward have his exertions brought him? He stands condemned by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Demetrius,  only the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Palestine, Arabia, Phenicia, and Achaia dissenting. Imperial Rome consents to his condemnation, and even convenes a senate to censure him,  not&mdash; as the rabid hounds who now pursue him cry&mdash; because of the novelty or heterodoxy of his doctrines, but because men could not tolerate the incomparable eloquence and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which, when once he opened his lips, made others seem dumb.</p>

<p>5. I have written the above quickly and incautiously, by the light of a poor lantern. You will see why, if you think of those who today represent <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a> and Aristippus. </p>
