<h1>Letter 33</h1>

<h2>I. He commends the Emperor's appeal to the chair of Peter</h2>

<p>Leo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod which is assembled at Ephesus </p>

<p>The devout <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of our most clement prince, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it especially concerns his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to prevent any seed of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from springing up within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has paid such deference to the Divine institutions as to apply to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> for a proper settlement: as if he wished it to be declared by the most blessed Peter himself what was praised in his confession, when the Lord said, <q>whom do men say that I, the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, am ?</q> and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> mentioned various people's opinion: but, when He asked what they themselves <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, the chief of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, embracing the fullness of the Faith in one short sentence, said, <q>You are the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, the son of the living God :</q> that is, You who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a> is also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> Son of the living God: You, I say, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in Godhead, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> in flesh and one altogether , the properties of the two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> being kept intact. And if Eutyches had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this intelligently and thoroughly, he would never have retreated from the path of this Faith. For Peter received this answer from the Lord for his confession. <q>Blessed are you, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto you, but My Father which is in heaven. And I say unto you, that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church: and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it <span class="stiki" id="note360335"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;16:17-18</a></span> .</q> But he who both rejects the blessed Peter's confession, and gainsays Christ's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, is far removed from union with this building; for he shows himself never to have had any <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for understanding the Truth, and to have only the empty appearance of high esteem, who did not adorn the hoary hairs of old age with any ripe judgment of the heart.</p>

<h2>II. The heresy of Eutyches is to be condemned, though his full repentance may lead to his restitution.</h2>

<p>But because the healing even of such men must not be neglected, and the most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperor has piously and devoutly desired a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to be held, that all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may be destroyed by a fuller judgment, I have sent our brothers Julius the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Renatus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and my son Hilary the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and with them Dulcitius the notary, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we have <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, to be present in my stead at your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> assembly, brethren, and settle in common with you what is in accordance with the Lord's will. To wit, that the pestilential <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> may be first condemned, and then the restitution of him, who has so unwisely erred, discussed, but only if embracing the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine he fully and openly with his own voice and signature condemns those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions in which his <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> has been ensnared: for this he has promised in the appeal which he sent to us, pledging himself to follow our judgment in all things.  On receiving our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Flavian's letter, we have replied to him at some length on the points which he seems to have referred to us : that when this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which seems to have arisen, has been destroyed, there may be one Faith and one and the same confession throughout the whole world to the praise and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that <q>in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things on earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> is in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father <span class="stiki" id="note360338"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse10">Philippians&nbsp;2:10</a></span> .</q> Dated 13th June in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>
