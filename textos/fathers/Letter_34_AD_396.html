<h1>Letter 34 (A.D. 396)</h1>

<p> <em>To Eusebius, My Excellent Lord and Brother, Worthy of Affection and Esteem, Augustine Sends Greeting.</em></p>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom the secrets of the heart of man are open, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it is because of my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peace that I am so deeply moved by the profane <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of those who basely and impiously persevere in dissenting from it. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> also that this feeling of mine is one tending towards peace, and that my desire is, not that any one should against his will be coerced into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion, but that to all who are in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> may be openly declared, and being by God's help clearly exhibited through my ministry, may so commend itself as to make them embrace and follow it.</p>

<p>2. Passing many other things unnoticed, what could be more worthy of detestation than what has just happened? A young man is reproved by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> for frequently beating his mother like a madman, and not restraining his impious hands from wounding her who bore him, even on those days on which the sternness of law shows mercy to the most guilty criminals.  He then threatens his mother that he would pass to the party of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, and that he would kill her whom he is accustomed to beat with incredible ferocity. He utters these threats, then passes over to the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, and is rebaptized while filled with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> rage, and is arrayed in white vestments while he is burning to shed his mother's blood. He is placed in a prominent and conspicuous position within the railing in the church; and to the eyes of sorrowful and indignant beholders, he who is purposing matricide is exhibited as a regenerate man.</p>

<p>3. I appeal to you, as a man of most mature judgment, can these things find favour in your eyes? I do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> this of you: I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your wisdom. A mother is wounded by her son in the members of that body which bore and nursed the ungrateful wretch; and when the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, his spiritual mother, interferes, she too is wounded in those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> by which, to the same ungrateful son, she ministered life and nourishment. Do you not seem to hear the young man gnashing his teeth in rage for a parent's blood, and saying, <q>What shall I do to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which forbids my wounding my mother? I have found out what to do: let the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself be wounded by such blows as she can suffer; let that be done in me which may <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> her members pain. Let me go to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to despise the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with which she gave me spiritual birth, and to mar the form which in her womb I received. Let me vex both my natural and my spiritual mother with cruel tortures: let the one who was the second to give me birth be the first to give me burial; for her sorrow let me seek spiritual death, and for the other's death let me prolong my natural life.</q> Oh, Eusebius! I appeal to you as an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> man, what else may we expect than that now he shall feel himself, as a <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a>, so armed as to have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in assailing that unhappy <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, decrepit with age and helpless in her widowhood, from wounding whom he was restrained while he remained a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>? For what else had he purposed in his passionate heart when he said to his mother, <q>I will pass over to the party of Donatus, and I will drink your blood?</q> Behold, arrayed in white vestments, but with <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> crimson with blood, he has fulfilled his threat in part; the other part remains, viz. that he drink his mother's blood. If, therefore, these things find favour in your eyes, let him be urged by those who are now his <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and his sanctifiers to fulfil within eight days the remaining portion of his vow.</p>

<p>4. The Lord's right hand indeed is strong, so that He may keep back this man's rage from that unhappy and desolate <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and, by means <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto His own wisdom, may deter him from his impious design; but could I do otherwise than utter my feelings when my heart was pierced with such grief? Shall they do such things, and am I to be commanded to hold my peace? When He commands me by the mouth of the apostle saying that those who teach what they ought not must be rebuked by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note111564"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse9">Titus&nbsp;1:9-13</a></span> shall I be silent through dread of their displeasure? The Lord deliver me from such folly! As to my desire for having such an impious crime recorded in our public registers, it was desired by me chiefly for this end, that no one who may hear me bewailing these proceedings, especially in other towns where it may be expedient for me to do so, may think that I am inventing a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and the rather, because in Hippo itself it is already affirmed that Proculeianus did not issue the order which was in the official report ascribed to him.</p>

<p>5. In what more temperate way could we dispose of this important matter than through the mediation of such a man as you, invested with most illustrious rank, and possessing calmness as well as great <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and goodwill? I beg, therefore, as I have already done by our brethren, good and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> men, whom I sent to your Excellency, that you will condescend to inquire whether it is the case that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Victor did not receive from his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> the order which the public official records reported; or whether, since Victor himself has said otherwise, they have in their records laid a thing <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> to his charge, though they belong to the same communion with him. Or, if he consents to our calmly discussing the whole question of our differences, in order that the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which is already manifest may become yet more so, I willingly embrace the opportunity. For I have heard that he proposed that without popular tumult, in the presence only of ten esteemed and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> men from each party, we should investigate what is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in this matter according to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. As to another proposal which some have reported to me as made by him, that I should rather go to Constantina,  because in that town his party was more numerous; or that I should go to Milevis, because there, as they say, they are soon to hold a council;&mdash; these things are absurd, for my special charge does not extend beyond the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Hippo. The whole importance of this question to me, in the first place, is as it affects Proculeianus and myself; and if, perchance, he thinks himself not a match for me, let him implore the aid of any one whom he pleases as his colleague in the debate. For in other towns we interfere with the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> only so far as is permitted or enjoined by our brethren bearing the same <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office with us, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of these towns.</p>

<p>6. And yet I cannot comprehend what there is in me, a novice, that should make him, who calls himself a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of so many years' standing, unwilling and afraid to enter into discussion with me. If it be my acquaintance with liberal studies, which perhaps he did not pursue at all, or at least not so much as I have done, what has this to do with the question in debate, which is to be decided by the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> or by <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> or public documents, with which he has for so many years been conversant, that he ought to be more skilled in them than I am? Once more, I have here my brother and colleague Samsucius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Turris,  who has not learned any of those branches of culture of which he is said to be afraid: let him attend in my place, and let the debate be between them. I will ask him, and, as I trust in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he will readily consent to take my place in this matter; and the Lord will, I trust, give aid to him when contending for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: for although unpolished in language, he is well instructed in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. There is therefore no reason for his referring me to others whom I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, instead of letting us settle between ourselves that which concerns ourselves. However, as I have said, I will not decline meeting them if he himself asks their assistance.</p>
