<h1>Letter 35</h1>

<p> <em>To the Bishop <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>.</em> </p>

<p>You are conspicuous, my Lord, for many forms of goodness, and your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is beautified in a special degree by loving-kindness, by contempt of riches, and by a generosity that gushes forth for the help of them that need. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> too that you deem worthy of more than ordinary attention those who have been brought up in prosperity and have fallen from it into trouble. <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">Knowing</a> this as well as I do I venture to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you the very admirable and excellent Celestinianus. He was once well known in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> for <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and position, now stripped of these he is favourably <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, for he bears what men call misfortune with resignation because it has brought him to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. He came to me with a letter which described his former prosperity, and after he had passed several days with me I <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what was said of him by experience. I have therefore no hesitation in commending him to your Holiness, and begging you to make him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the well-to-do men of the city. It is probable that when they have learned what has befallen him, in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of a like <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> befalling themselves, they will endeavour to escape judgment by showing mercy. He has no resource but to go about begging, as he is put to the greater expense because he has with him his wife and children, and the domestics who with him escaped the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the barbarians.</p>
