<h1>Letter 37</h1>

<p> <em>To Salustius the Governor. </em></p>

<p>When rulers keep the scales of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and let them hang in even balance, they confer all kinds of benefits upon their subjects; if they are also gifted with <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> and further show loving-kindness to him that needs it, manifold advantages accrue from their rule to them that live under it. Having enjoyed these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things through your excellency, and having experienced them in your former administration, they have now been moved with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at the information that to your munificence the helm of government has been entrusted. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that they may gain yet greater good, that your excellency may win still higher praise, and that the encomiums of your eulogists may be vindicated by the addition to all your other <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> titles to fame of that colophon  of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things&mdash; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. As I was compelled to pass several days in Hierapolis I hoped to have the pleasure of meeting your excellency, and persistently enquired of new comers if the insignia of office had been conveyed to you. But I was compelled by the divine feast of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to return in haste to the city entrusted to me. Now however that I have received your excellency's letter, with very great pleasure I return your salutation, and without delay have sent, as you requested, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who is by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> a water-finder. May the Lord in His loving kindness grant him both to do good service to the city and increase your excellency's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>
