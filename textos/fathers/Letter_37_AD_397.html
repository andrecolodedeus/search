<h1>Letter 37 (A.D. 397)</h1>

<p> <em>To Simplicianus</em>,  <em>My Lord Most Blessed, and My Father Most Worthy of Being Cherished with Respect and Sincere Affection, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. I received the letter which your Holiness kindly sent&mdash;a letter full of occasions of much <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to me, because assuring me that you remember me, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me as you used to do, and that you take great pleasure in every one of the gifts which the Lord has in His compassion been pleased to bestow on me. In reading that letter, I have eagerly welcomed the fatherly affection which flows from your benignant heart towards me: and this I have not found for the first time, as something short-lived and new, but long ago <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> and well known, my lord, most blessed, and most worthy of being cherished with respect and sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>2. Whence comes so great a recompense for the literary labour given by me to the writing of a few books as this, that your Excellency should condescend to read them? Is it not that the Lord, to whom my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is devoted, has purposed thus to comfort me under my anxieties, and to lighten the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> with which in such labour I cannot but be exercised, lest, notwithstanding the evenness of the plain of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I stumble through want either of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> or of caution? For when what I write meets your approval, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> by whom it is approved, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who dwells in you; and the Giver and Dispenser of all spiritual gifts designs by your approbation to confirm my <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to Him. For whatever in these writings of mine merits your approbation is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has by me as His instrument said, <q>Let it be done,</q> and it was done; and in your approval God has pronounced that what was done is <q>good.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111598"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;1:3-4</a></span> </p>

<p>3. As for the questions which you have condescended to command me to resolve, even if through the dulness of my mind I did not understand them, I might through the assistance of your merits find an answer to them. This only I ask, that on account of my weakness you intercede with God for me, and that whatever writings of mine come into your sacred hands, whether on the topics to which you have in a manner so kind and fatherly directed my attention, or on any others, you will not only take pains to read them, but also accept the charge of reviewing and correcting them; for I acknowledge the mistakes which I myself have made, as readily as the gifts which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has bestowed on me.</p>
