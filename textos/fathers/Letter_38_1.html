<h1>Letter 38</h1>

<p><strong>To Marcella</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Bl&aelig;silla, the daughter of <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> and sister of <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, had lost her husband seven months after her marriage. A dangerous illness had then led to her conversion, and she was now famous throughout Rome for the length to which she carried her austerities. Many censured her for what they deemed her fanaticism, and Jerome, as her spiritual adviser, came in for some of the blame. In the present letter he defends her conduct, and declares that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who cavil at lives like hers have no claim to be considered <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. Written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 385 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. When <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> is tempted to slay his son the trial only serves to strengthen his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300758"><a href="../bible/gen022.htm">Genesis&nbsp;xxii</a></span> When Joseph is sold into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, his sojourn there enables him to support his father and his brothers.  When Hezekiah is panic-stricken at the near approach of death, his tears and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> obtain for him a respite of fifteen years.  If the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the apostle, Peter, is shaken by his Lord's passion, it is that, weeping bitterly, he may hear the soothing words: <q>Feed my sheep.</q>  If <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that ravening wolf, <span class="stiki" id="note300762"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse27">Genesis&nbsp;49:27</a></span> that little Benjamin,  is blinded in a trance, it is that he may receive his sight, and may be led, by the sudden horror of surrounding darkness, to call Him Lord Whom before he <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> as man. <span class="stiki" id="note300764"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;9:3-18</a></span> </p>

<p>2. So is it now, my dear Marcella, with our beloved Bl&aelig;silla. The burning fever from which we have seen her suffering unceasingly for nearly thirty days has been sent to teach her to renounce her over-great attention to that body which the worms must shortly devour. The Lord Jesus has come to her in her sickness, and has taken her by the hand, and behold, she arises and ministers unto Him. <span class="stiki" id="note300765"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse30">Mark&nbsp;1:30-31</a></span> Formerly her life savored somewhat of carelessness; and, fast bound in the bands of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, she lay as one dead in the tomb of the world. But Jesus was moved with indignation,  and was troubled in spirit, and cried aloud and said, Bl&aelig;silla, come forth. <span class="stiki" id="note300767"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse38">John&nbsp;11:38-44</a></span> She, at His call, has arisen and has come forth, and sits at meat with the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note300768"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;12:2</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, if they will, may threaten her in their <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>; they may seek to slay her, because Christ has raised her up. <span class="stiki" id="note300769"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse10">John&nbsp;12:10</a></span> It is enough that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> give God the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. Bl&aelig;silla <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that her life is due to Him who has given it back to her. She <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that now she can clasp the feet of Him whom but a little while ago she dreaded as her judge. <span class="stiki" id="note300770"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse38">Luke&nbsp;7:38</a></span> Then life had all but forsaken her body, and the approach of death made her gasp and shiver. What succour did she obtain in that hour from her kinsfolk? What comfort was there in their words lighter than smoke? She owes no debt to you, you unkindly kindred, now that she is dead to the world and alive unto Christ. <span class="stiki" id="note300771"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;6:11</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> must <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that it is so, and he that is vexed must admit that he has no claim to be called a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>.</p>

<p>3. A <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> who is <q>loosed from the law of her husband</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300772"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;7:2</a></span> has, for her one duty, to continue a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>. But, you will say, a sombre dress vexes the world. In that case, John the Baptist would vex it, too; and yet, among those that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, there has not been a greater than he. <span class="stiki" id="note300773"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse28">Luke&nbsp;7:28</a></span> He was called an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>;  he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the Lord Himself, and yet he was clothed in raiment of camel's hair, and girded with a leathern girdle. <span class="stiki" id="note300775"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;3:4</a></span> Is the world displeased because a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow's</a> food is coarse? Nothing can be coarser than locusts, and yet these were the food of John. The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who ought to scandalize <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are those who paint their eyes and lips with rouge and cosmetics; whose chalked faces, unnaturally white, are like those of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; upon whose cheeks every chance tear leaves a furrow; who fail to realize that years make them old; who heap their heads with hair not their own; who smooth their faces, and rub out the wrinkles of age; and who, in the presence of their grandsons, behave like trembling school-girls. A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> should blush to do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to nature, or to stimulate desire by bestowing care upon the flesh. <q>They that are in the flesh,</q> the apostle tells us, <q>cannot please God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300776"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;8:8</a></span> </p>

<p>4. In days gone by our dear <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> was extremely fastidious in her dress, and spent whole days before her mirror to correct its deficiencies. Now she boldly says: <q>We all with unveiled face, beholding as in a glass the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, even as by the spirit of the Lord.</q>  In those days maids arranged her hair, and her head, which had done no harm, was forced into a waving head-dress. Now she leaves her hair alone, and her only head-dress is a veil. In those days the softest feather-bed seemed hard to her, and she could scarcely find rest on a pile of mattresses. Now she rises eager for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, her shrill voice cries <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a> before every other, she is the first to praise her Lord. She kneels upon the bare ground, and with frequent tears cleanses a face once defiled with white lead. After <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> comes the singing of psalms, and it is only when her neck aches and her knees totter, and her eyes begin to close with weariness, that she gives them leave reluctantly to rest. As her dress is dark, lying on the ground does not soil it. Cheap shoes permit her to give to the poor the price of gilded ones. No gold and jewels adorn her girdle; it is made of wool, plain and scrupulously clean. It is intended to keep her clothes right, and not to cut her waist in two. Therefore, if the scorpion looks askance upon her purpose, and with alluring words tempts her once more to eat of the forbidden tree, she must crush him beneath her feet with a curse, and say, as he lies dying in his allotted dust: <span class="stiki" id="note300778"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;3:14</a></span> <q>Get behind me, <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300779"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;16:23</a></span> <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> means adversary, <span class="stiki" id="note300780"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span> and one who dislikes Christ's commandments, is more than Christ's adversary; he is anti-christ.</p>

<p>5. But what, I ask you, have we ever done that men should be offended at us? Have we ever imitated the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? We are told of the first <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> that they forsook their boat and their nets, and even their aged father. <span class="stiki" id="note300781"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;4:18-22</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> stood up from the receipt of custom and followed the Saviour once for all. <span class="stiki" id="note300782"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;9:9</a></span> And when a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> wished to return home, that he might take leave of his kinsfolk, the Master's voice refused consent. <span class="stiki" id="note300783"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse61">Luke&nbsp;9:61-62</a></span> A son was even forbidden to bury his father, <span class="stiki" id="note300784"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;8:21</a></span> as if to show that it is sometimes a religious duty to be undutiful for the Lord's sake. <span class="stiki" id="note300785"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;14:26</a></span> With us it is different. We are held to be <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> if we refuse to dress in silk. We are called sour and severe if we keep sober and refrain from excessive laughter. The mob salutes us as Greeks and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">impostors</a>  if our tunics are fresh and clean. They may deal in still severer witticisms if they please; they may parade every fat paunch  they can lay hold of, to turn us into ridicule. Our Bl&aelig;silla will laugh at their efforts, and will bear with patience the taunts of all such croaking frogs, for she will remember that men called her Lord, <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300788"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;10:25</a></span> </p>
