<h1>Letter 38</h1>

<h2>He acknowledges the receipt of a letter and advises mercy if Eutyches will recant.</h2>

<p>Leo to Flavian, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople.</p>

<p>When our brethren had already started whom we dispatched to you in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the Faith, we received your letter, beloved, by our son Basil the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, in which you rightly said very little on the subject of our common anxiety, both because the accounts which had already arrived had given us full information on every thing, and because for purposes of private inquiry it was easy to converse with the aforesaid Basil, by whom now through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in whom we trust, we exhort you, beloved, in reply, using the Apostle's words, and saying: <q>Be in nothing affrighted by the adversaries; which is for them a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of perdition, but to you of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> <span class="stiki" id="note360358"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse28">Philippians&nbsp;1:28</a></span> .</q> For what is so calamitous as to wish to destroy all hope of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by denying the reality of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Incarnation, and to contradict the Apostle who says distinctly: <q>great is the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of Godliness which was manifest in the flesh ?</q> What so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> as to fight for the Faith of the gospel against the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> nativity and cross? About whose most pure light and unconquered power we have already disclosed what was in our heart, in the letter which has been sent to you beloved : lest anything might seem doubtful between us on those things which we have learned, and teach in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> doctrine. But seeing that the testimonies to the Truth are so clear and strong that a man must be reckoned thoroughly blind and stubborn, who does not at once shake himself free from the mists of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> in the bright light of reason; we desire you to use the remedy of long-suffering in curing the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> that through your fatherly admonitions they who though old in years are infants in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, may learn to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their elders. And if they give up the vain conceits of their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and come to their senses, and if they condemn all their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and receive the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith, do not deny them the mercifulness of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> kind heart: although your judgment must remain, if their impiety which you have deservedly condemned persists in its depravity. Dated 23 July in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>
