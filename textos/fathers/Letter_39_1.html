<h1>Letter 39</h1>

<p><strong>To Paula</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Bl&aelig;silla died within three months of her conversion, and Jerome now writes to <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> to offer her his sympathy and, if possible, to moderate her grief. He asks her to remember that Bl&aelig;silla is now in paradise, and so far to control herself as to prevent enemies of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> from cavilling at her conduct. Then he concludes with the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> (since more than fulfilled) that in his writings Bl&aelig;silla's name shall never die. Written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 389 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. <q>Oh that my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears: that I might weep,</q> not as Jeremiah says, <q>For the slain of my people,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300789"><a href="../bible/jer009.htm#verse1">Jeremiah&nbsp;9:1</a></span> nor as Jesus, for the miserable <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of Jerusalem, <span class="stiki" id="note300790"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;19:41</a></span> but for <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, mercy, innocence, <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, and all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, for all are gone now that Bl&aelig;silla is dead. For her sake I do not grieve, but for myself I must; my loss is too great to be borne with resignation. Who can recall with dry eyes the glowing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which induced a girl of twenty to raise the standard of the Cross, and to mourn the loss of her <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> more than the death of her husband? Who can recall without a sigh the earnestness of her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, the brilliancy of her conversation, the tenacity of her memory, and the quickness of her <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>? Had you heard her speak Greek you would have deemed her <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Latin; yet when she used the tongue of Rome her words were free from a foreign accent. She even rivalled the great <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in those acquirements which won for him the admiration of Greece. For in a few months, or rather days, she so completely mastered the difficulties of Hebrew as to emulate her mother's <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in learning and singing the psalms. Her attire was plain, but this plainness was not, as it often is, a mark of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Indeed, her self-abasement was so perfect that she dressed no better than her maids, and was only distinguished from them by the greater ease of her walk. Her steps tottered with weakness, her face was pale and quivering, her slender neck scarcely upheld her head. Still she always had in her hand a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> or a gospel. As I think of her my eyes fill with tears, sobs impede my voice, and such is my emotion that my tongue cleaves to the roof of my mouth. As she lay there dying, her poor frame parched with burning fever, and her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a> gathered round her bed, her last words were: <q>Pray to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, that He may pardon me, because what I would have done I have not been able to do.</q> Be at peace, dear Bl&aelig;silla, in full assurance that your garments are always white. <span class="stiki" id="note300791"><a href="../bible/ecc009.htm#verse8">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;9:8</a></span> For yours is the purity of an everlasting <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. I feel confident that my words are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>: conversion can never be too late. The words to the dying robber are a pledge of this: <q>Verily I say unto you, today shall you be with me in paradise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300792"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;23:43</a></span> When at last her spirit was delivered from the burden of the flesh, and had returned to Him who gave it; <span class="stiki" id="note300793"><a href="../bible/ecc012.htm#verse7">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;12:7</a></span> when, too, after her long pilgrimage, she had ascended up into her ancient heritage, her obsequies were celebrated with customary splendor. People of rank headed the procession, a pall made of cloth of gold covered her bier. But I seemed to hear a voice from heaven, saying: <q>I do not recognize these trappings; such is not the garb I used to wear; this magnificence is strange to me.</q></p>

<p>2. But what is this? I wish to check a mother's weeping, and I groan myself. I make no secret of my feelings; this entire letter is written in tears. Even Jesus wept for Lazarus because He loved him. <span class="stiki" id="note300794"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;11:35-36</a></span> But he is a poor comforter who is overcome by his own sighs, and from whose afflicted heart tears are wrung as well as words. Dear <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, my agony is as great as yours. Jesus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it, whom Bl&aelig;silla now follows; the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, whose company she now enjoys. I was her father in the spirit, her foster-father in affection. Sometimes I say: <q>Let the day perish wherein I was born,</q>  and again, <q>Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300796"><a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;15:10</a></span> I cry: <q>Righteous are you, O Lord...yet let me talk with you of your judgments. Wherefore does the way of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> prosper?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300797"><a href="../bible/jer012.htm#verse1">Jeremiah&nbsp;12:1</a></span> and <q>as for me, my feet were almost gone, my steps had nearly slipped. For I was <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> at the foolish when I saw the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and I said: How does God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? And is there <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the most high? Behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</q>  But again I recall other words, <q>If I say I will speak thus, behold I should offend against the generation of your children.</q>  Do not great waves of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> surge up over my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> as over yours? How comes it, I ask, that godless men live to old age in the enjoyment of this world's riches? How comes it that untutored youth and innocent childhood are cut down while still in the bud? Why is it that children three years old or two, and even unweaned infants, are possessed with devils, covered with <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, and eaten up with jaundice, while godless men and profane, adulterers and murderers, have health and strength to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> God? Are we not told that the unrighteousness of the father does not fall upon the son, <span class="stiki" id="note300800"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse20">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:20</a></span> and that <q>the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> it shall die?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300801"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse4">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:4</a></span> Or if the old doctrine holds good that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the fathers must be visited upon the children, <span class="stiki" id="note300802"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;20:5</a></span> an old man's countless <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> cannot fairly be avenged upon a harmless infant. And I have said: <q>Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency. For all the day long have I been plagued.</q>  Yet when I have thought of these things, like the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> I have learned to say: <q>When I thought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; then understood I their end.</q>  Truly the judgments of the Lord are a great deep.  <q>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past finding out!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300806"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33</a></span> God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and all that He does must be good also. Does He decree that I must lose my husband? I mourn my loss, but because it is His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> I bear it with resignation. Is an only son snatched from me? The blow is hard, yet it can be borne, for He who has taken away is He who gave. <span class="stiki" id="note300807"><a href="../bible/job001.htm#verse21">Job&nbsp;1:21</a></span> If I become blind a friend's reading will console me. If I become deaf I shall escape from sinful words, and my thoughts shall be of God alone. And if, besides such trials as these, poverty, cold, sickness, and nakedness oppress me, I shall wait for death, and regard them as passing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, soon to give way to a better issue. Let us reflect on the words of the sapiential psalm: <q>Righteous are you, O Lord, and upright are your judgments.</q>  Only he can speak thus who in all his troubles magnifies the Lord, and, putting down his sufferings to his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, thanks God for his clemency.</p>

<p>The daughters of Judah, we are told, rejoiced, because of all the judgments of the Lord.  Therefore, since Judah means confession, and since every believing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> confesses its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300810"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;10:10</a></span> he who claims to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Christ must <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in all Christ's judgments. Am I in health? I thank my Creator. Am I sick? In this case, too, I praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>. For <q>when I am weak, then am I strong;</q> and the strength of the spirit is made perfect in the weakness of the flesh. Even an apostle must bear what he dislikes, that ailment for the removal of which he besought the Lord thrice. God's reply was: <q>My <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> is sufficient for you; for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</q>  Lest he should be unduly elated by his revelations, a reminder of his <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> weakness was given to him, just as in the triumphal car of the victorious general there was always a slave to whisper constantly, amid the cheerings of the multitude, <q>Remember that you are but man.</q> </p>

<p>3. But why should that be hard to bear which we must one day ourselves endure? And why do we grieve for the dead? We are not born to live forever. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and Isaiah, Peter, James, and John, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the <q>chosen vessel,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300813"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;9:15</a></span> and even the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> Himself have all died; and are we vexed when a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> leaves its earthly tenement? Perhaps he is taken away, <q>lest that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding...for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to take him away from the people</q> &mdash; lest in life's long journey he should lose his way in some trackless maze. We should indeed mourn for the dead, but only for him whom Gehenna receives, whom Tartarus devours, and for whose punishment the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> burns. But we who, in departing, are accompanied by an escort of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and met by Christ Himself, should rather grieve that we have to tarry yet longer in this tabernacle of death. <span class="stiki" id="note300815"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:4</a></span> For <q>while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300816"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:6</a></span> Our one longing should be that expressed by the psalmist: <q>Woe is me that my pilgrimage is prolonged, that I have dwelt with them that dwell in Kedar, that my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has made a far pilgrimage.</q>  Kedar means darkness, and darkness stands for this present world (for, we are told, <q>the light shines in darkness; and the darkness comprehends it not</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300818"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;1:5</a></span>). Therefore we should congratulate our dear Bl&aelig;silla that she has passed from darkness to light, <span class="stiki" id="note300819"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse8">Ephesians&nbsp;5:8</a></span> and has in the first flush of her dawning <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> received the crown of her completed work. Had she been cut off (as I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that none may be) while her thoughts were full of worldly desires and passing pleasures, then mourning would indeed have been her due, and no tears shed for her would have been too many. As it is, by the mercy of Christ she, four months ago, renewed her <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in her vow of widowhood, and for the rest of her days spurned the world, and thought only of the religious life. Have you no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, then, lest the Saviour may say to you: Are you <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, that your daughter has become my daughter? Are you vexed at my decree, and do you, with rebellious tears, grudge me the possession of Bl&aelig;silla? You ought to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what my purpose is both for you and for yours. You deny yourself food, not to fast but to gratify your grief; and such abstinence is displeasing to me. Such <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a> are my enemies. I receive no <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which forsakes the body against my will. A foolish <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> may boast of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of this kind; it may boast of a Zeno  a Cleombrotus,  or a Cato.  My spirit rests only upon him <q>that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and that trembles at my word. <span class="stiki" id="note300823"><a href="../bible/isa066.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;66:2</a></span> Is this the meaning of your vow to me that you would lead a religious life? Is it for this that you dress yourself differently from other matrons, and array yourself in the garb of a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a>? Mourning is for those who wear silk dresses. In the midst of your tears the call will come, and you, too, must die; yet you flee from me as from a cruel judge, and fancy that you can avoid falling into my hands. Jonah, that headstrong <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, once fled from me, yet in the depths of the sea he was still mine. <span class="stiki" id="note300824"><a href="../bible/jon002.htm#verse2">Jonah&nbsp;2:2-7</a></span> If you really <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> your daughter to be alive, you would not grieve that she had passed to a better world. This is the commandment that I have given you through my apostle, that you sorrow not for them that sleep, even as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, which have no hope. <span class="stiki" id="note300825"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> Blush, for you are put to shame by the example of a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>. The <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> handmaid  is better than mine. For, while she imagines that her unbelieving husband has been translated to heaven, you either do not or will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that your daughter is at rest with me.</q></p>

<p>4. Why should I not mourn, you say? Jacob put on sackcloth for Joseph, and when all his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> gathered round him, refused to be comforted. <q>I will go down,</q> he said, <q>into the grave unto my son mourning.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300827"><a href="../bible/gen037.htm#verse35">Genesis&nbsp;37:35</a></span> David also mourned for Absalom, covering his face, and crying: <q>O my son, Absalom...my son, Absalom! Would God I had died for you, O Absalom, my son!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300828"><a href="../bible/2sa018.htm#verse33">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;18:33</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300829"><a href="../bible/deu034.htm#verse8">Deuteronomy&nbsp;34:8</a></span> too, and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300830"><a href="../bible/num020.htm#verse29">Numbers&nbsp;20:29</a></span> and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> were mourned for with a solemn mourning. The answer to your reasoning is simple. Jacob, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, mourned for Joseph, whom he fancied slain, and thought to meet only in the grave (his words were: <q>I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning</q>), but he only did so because Christ had not yet broken open the door of paradise, nor quenched with his blood the flaming sword and the whirling of the guardian <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a>.  (Hence in the story of Dives and Lazarus, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and the beggar, though really in a place of refreshment, are described as being in <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. ) And David, who, after interceding in vain for the life of his infant child, refused to weep for it, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, did well to weep for a son who had been a parricide&mdash; in will, if not in deed. <span class="stiki" id="note300833"><a href="../bible/2sa017.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;17:1-4</a></span> And when we read that, for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>, lamentation was made after ancient custom, this ought not to surprise us, for even in the Acts of the Apostles, in the full blaze of the gospel, we see that the brethren at Jerusalem made great lamentation for Stephen. <span class="stiki" id="note300834"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse2">Acts&nbsp;8:2</a></span> This great lamentation, however, refers not to the mourners, but to the funeral procession and to the crowds which accompanied it. This is what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says of Jacob: <q>Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, and all the house of Joseph and his brethren</q>; and a few lines farther on: <q>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a great company.</q> Finally, <q>they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation.</q>  This solemn lamentation does not impose prolonged weeping upon the Egyptians, but simply describes the funeral ceremony. In like manner, when we read of weeping made for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a>,  this is all that is meant.</p>

<p>I cannot adequately extol the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Scripture, nor sufficiently admire the spiritual meaning conveyed in its most simple words. We are told, for instance, that lamentation was made for <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>; yet when the funeral of Joshua is described <span class="stiki" id="note300837"><a href="../bible/jos024.htm#verse30">Joshua&nbsp;24:30</a></span> no mention at all is made of weeping. The reason, of course, is that under <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>&mdash; that is under the old Law&mdash; all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were bound by the sentence passed on Adam's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and when they descended into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>  were rightly accompanied with tears. For, as the apostle says, <q>death reigned from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, even over them that had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300839"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;5:14</a></span> But under Jesus,  that is, under the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who has unlocked for us the gate of paradise, death is accompanied, not with sorrow, but with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> go on weeping to this day; they make bare their feet, they crouch in sackcloth, they roll in ashes. And to make their <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a> complete, they follow a foolish custom of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, and eat lentils,  to show, it would seem, for what poor fare they have lost their birthright. <span class="stiki" id="note300842"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse34">Genesis&nbsp;25:34</a></span> Of course they are right to weep, for as they do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the Lord's resurrection they are being made ready for the advent of antichrist. But we who have put on Christ <span class="stiki" id="note300843"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians&nbsp;3:27</a></span> and according to the apostle are a royal and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> race, <span class="stiki" id="note300844"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:9</a></span> we ought not to grieve for the dead. <q><a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,</q> the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> tells us, <q>said unto <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> and unto Eleazar, and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left: Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> come upon all the people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300845"><a href="../bible/lev010.htm#verse6">Leviticus&nbsp;10:6,&nbsp;12</a></span> Rend not your clothes, he says, neither mourn as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>, lest you die. For, for us <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is death. In this same book, Leviticus, there is a provision which may perhaps strike some as cruel, yet is necessary to <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> is forbidden to approach the dead bodies of his father and mother, of his brothers and of his children; <span class="stiki" id="note300846"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse10">Leviticus&nbsp;21:10-12</a></span> to the end, that no grief may distract a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> engaged in offering <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and wholly devoted to the Divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. Are we not taught the same lesson in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> in other words? Is not the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> forbidden to say farewell to his home or to bury his dead father? <span class="stiki" id="note300847"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse59">Luke&nbsp;9:59-62</a></span> Of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, again, it is said: <q>He shall not go out of the sanctuary, and the sanctification of his God shall not be contaminated, for the anointing oil of his God is upon him.</q>  Certainly, now that we have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and bear Him within us, by reason of the oil of His anointing which we have received, <span class="stiki" id="note300849"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:27</a></span> we ought not to depart from His temple&mdash; that is, from our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> profession&mdash; we ought not to go forth to mingle with the unbelieving <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, but always to remain within, as servants <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord.</p>

<p>5. I have spoken plainly, lest you might <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> suppose that Scripture sanctions your grief; and that, if you <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a>, you have reason on your side. And, so far, my words have been addressed to the average <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. But now it will not be so. For in your case, as I well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, renunciation of the world has been complete; you have rejected and trampled on the delights of life, and you give yourself daily to <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, to reading, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Like <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300850"><a href="../bible/gen012.htm#verse1">Genesis&nbsp;12:1-4</a></span> you desire to leave your country and kindred, to forsake Mesopotamia and the Chald&aelig;ans, to enter into the promised land. Dead to the world before your death, you have spent all your mere worldly substance upon the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, or have bestowed it upon your children. I am the more surprised, therefore, that you should act in a manner which in others would <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> call for reprehension. You call to mind Bl&aelig;silla's companionship, her conversation, and her endearing ways; and you cannot endure the thought that you have lost them all. I pardon you the tears of a mother, but I ask you to restrain your grief. When I think of the parent I cannot blame you for weeping: but when I think of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and the recluse, the mother disappears from my view. Your wound is still fresh, and any touch of mine, however gentle, is more likely to inflame than to heal it. Yet why do you not try to overcome by reason a grief which time must inevitably assuage? Naomi, fleeing because of famine to the land of Moab, there lost her husband and her sons. Yet when she was thus deprived of her natural protectors, Ruth, a stranger, never left her side. <span class="stiki" id="note300851"><a href="../bible/rut001.htm">Ruth&nbsp;i</a></span> And see what a great thing it is to comfort a lonely <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>! Ruth, for her reward, is made an ancestress of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300852"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;1:5</a></span> Consider the great trials which Job endured, and you will see that you are over-delicate. Amid the ruins of his house, the pains of his sores, his countless bereavements, and, last of all, the snares laid for him by his wife, he still lifted up his eyes to heaven, and maintained his patience unbroken. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what you are going to say: <q>All this befell him as a righteous man, to try his righteousness.</q> Well, choose which alternative you please. Either you are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, in which case God is putting your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>; or else you are a sinner, in which case you have no right to complain. For if so, you endure far less than your deserts.</p>

<p>Why should I repeat old stories? Listen to a modern instance. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Melanium,  eminent among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for her <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> nobility (may the Lord grant that you and I may have part with her in His day!), while the dead body of her husband was still unburied, still warm, had the misfortune to lose at one stroke two of her sons. The sequel seems incredible, but Christ is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that my words are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. Would you not suppose that in her frenzy she would have unbound her hair, and rent her clothes, and torn her breast? Yet not a tear fell from her eyes. Motionless she stood there; then casting herself at the feet of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, she smiled, as though she held Him with her hands. <q>Henceforth, Lord,</q> she said, <q>I will serve You more readily, for You have freed me from a great burden.</q> But perhaps her remaining children overcame her determination. No, indeed; she set so little store by them that she gave up all that she had to her only son, and then, in spite of the approaching winter, took ship for Jerusalem.</p>

<p>6. Spare yourself, I beseech you, spare Bl&aelig;silla, who now reigns with Christ; at least spare <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, whose tender years and inexperience depend on you for guidance and instruction. Now does the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> rage and complain that he is set at naught, because he sees one of your children exalted in triumph. The victory which he failed to win over her that is gone he hopes to obtain over her who still remains. Too great affection towards one's children is disaffection towards God. <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> gladly prepares to slay his only son, and do you complain if one child out of several has received her crown? I cannot say what I am going to say without a groan. When you were carried fainting out of the funeral procession, whispers such as these were audible in the crowd. <q>Is not this what we have often said. She weeps for her daughter, killed with <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. She wanted her to marry again, that she might have grandchildren. How long must we refrain from driving these detestable <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> out of Rome? Why do we not stone them or hurl them into the Tiber? They have misled this unhappy lady; that she is not a <a href="../cathen/11164a.htm">nun</a> from choice is clear. No <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> mother ever wept for her children as she does for Bl&aelig;silla.</q> What sorrow, think you, must not Christ have endured when He listened to such words as these! And how triumphantly must <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> have exulted, eager as he is to snatch your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>! Luring you with the claims of a grief which seems natural and right, and always keeping before you the image of Bl&aelig;silla, his aim is to slay the mother of the victress, and then to fall upon her forsaken sister. I do not speak thus to terrify you. The Lord is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that I address you now as though I were standing at His judgment seat. Tears which have no meaning are an object of abhorrence. Yours are detestable tears, <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> tears, unbelieving tears; for they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no limits, and bring you to the verge of death. You shriek and cry out as though on fire within, and do your best to put an end to yourself. But to you and others like you Jesus comes in His mercy and says: <q>Why do you weep? The damsel is not dead but sleeps.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300854"><a href="../bible/mar005.htm#verse39">Mark&nbsp;5:39</a></span> The bystanders may laugh him to scorn; such unbelief is worthy of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. If you prostrate yourself in grief at your daughter's tomb you too will hear the chiding of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, <q>Why do you seek the living among the dead?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300855"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;24:5</a></span> It was because Mary Magdalene had done this that when she recognized the Lord's voice calling her and fell at His feet, He said to her: <q>Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300856"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse17">John&nbsp;20:17</a></span> that is to say, you are not worthy to touch, as risen, one whom you suppose still in the tomb.</p>

<p>7. What crosses and tortures, think you, must not our Bl&aelig;silla endure to see Christ <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with you, though it be but a little! At this moment she cries to you as you weep: <q>If ever you loved me, mother, if I was nourished at your breast, if I was taught by your precepts, do not grudge me my exaltation, do not so act that we shall be separated forever. Do you fancy that I am alone? In place of you I now have Mary the mother of the Lord. Here I see many whom before I have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. My companions are infinitely better than any that I had on earth. Here I have the company of Anna, the prophetess of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note300857"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse36">Luke&nbsp;2:36-37</a></span> and&mdash; what should kindle in you more fervent <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>&mdash; I have gained in three short months what cost her the labor of many years to win. Both of us <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> indeed, we have been both rewarded with the palm of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Do you pity me because I have left the world behind me? It is I who should, and do, pity you who, still immured in its <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, daily fight with <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, with <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, with this or that <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> leading the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to ruin. If you wish to be indeed my mother, you must please Christ. She is not my mother who displeases my Lord.</q> Many other things does she say which here I pass over; she <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> also to God for you. For me, too, I feel sure, she makes intercession and asks God to pardon my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in return for the warnings and advice that I bestowed on her, when to secure her <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> I braved the ill will of her <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.</p>

<p>8. Therefore, so long as breath animates my body, so long as I continue in the enjoyment of life, I engage, declare, and promise that Bl&aelig;silla's name shall be forever on my tongue, that my labors shall be dedicated to her <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and that my talents shall be devoted to her praise. No page will I write in which Bl&aelig;silla's name shall not occur. Wherever the records of my utterance shall find their way, there she, too, will travel with my poor writings. Virgins, <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, as they read, will see how deeply her image is impressed upon my mind. Everlasting remembrance will make up for the shortness of her life. Living as she does with Christ in heaven, she will live also on the lips of men. The present will soon pass away and give place to the future, and that future will judge her without partiality and without prejudice. As a childless <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> she will occupy a middle place between <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, the mother of children, and <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a> the virgin. In my writings she will never die. She will hear me conversing of her always, either with her sister or with her mother.</p>
