<h1>Letter 3</h1>

<p> <em>For 331. Easter-day xvi Pharmuthi; iii Id. April; &AElig;ra Dioclet. 47; Coss. Annius Bassus, Ablabius; Pr&aelig;fect, Florentius; Indict. iv.</em></p>

<p>Again, my beloved brethren, the day of the feast draws near to us, which, above all others, should be devoted to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, which the law commands to be observed, and which it would be an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> thing for us to pass over in silence. For although we have been held under restraint by those who afflict us, that, because of them, we should not announce to you this season; yet thanks be to '<a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who comforts the afflicted ,' that we have not been overcome by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of our accusers and silenced; but <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the voice of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we together with you cry aloud in the day of the feast. For the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all has commanded, saying, 'Speak , and the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>.' And the Spirit exhorts in the Psalm; 'Blow the trumpet in the new moons , in the solemn day of your feast.' And the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> cries; 'Keep your feasts, O Judah. ' I do not send word to you as though you were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>; but I publish it to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, that you may perceive that although men have separated us, yet God having made us companions, we approach the same feast, and worship the same Lord continually. And we do not keep the festival as observers of days, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the Apostle reproves those who do so, in those words which he spoke; 'You observe days, and months, and times, and years <span class="stiki" id="note283979"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;4:10</a></span>.' But rather do we consider the day solemn because of the feast; so that all of us, who serve God in every place, may together in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> be well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, announcing the nearness of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> like this, did not announce days, but the Lord, for whose sake we keep the feast, saying, 'Christ, our <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> <span class="stiki" id="note283980"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span>;' so that we all, contemplating the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> of the Word, may draw near to do Him service.</p>

<p>2. For what else is the feast, but the service of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? And what is that service, but prolonged <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and unceasing thanksgiving ? The unthankful departing far from these are rightly deprived of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> springing therefrom: for '<a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> are taken from their mouth. ' Therefore, the [divine] word does not allow them to have peace; 'For there is no peace to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, says the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note283983"><a href="../bible/isa048.htm#verse22">Isaiah&nbsp;48:22</a></span>,' they labour in pain and grief. So, not even to him who owed ten thousand talents did the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> grant forgiveness in the sight of the Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note283984"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;18:24</a></span> For even he, having received forgiveness of great things, was forgetful of kindness in little ones, so that he paid the penalty also of those former things. And <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> indeed, for having himself experienced kindness, he was required to be merciful to his fellow servant. He too that received the one talent, and bound it up in a napkin, and hid it in the earth, was in consequence cast out for unthankfulness, hearing the words, 'You <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> servant, you knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not scattered; you ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and on my return, I should have received my own. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that has ten talents <span class="stiki" id="note283985"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;25:26</a></span>.' For, of course, when he was required to deliver up to his lord that which belonged to him, he should have acknowledged the kindness of him who gave it, and the value of that which was given. For he who gave was not a hard man, had he been so, he would not have given even in the first instance; neither was that which was given unprofitable and vain, for then he had not found fault. But both he who gave was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and that which was given was capable of bearing fruit. As therefore 'he who withholds grain in seed-time is cursed <span class="stiki" id="note283986"><a href="../bible/pro011.htm#verse26">Proverbs&nbsp;11:26</a></span>,' according to the divine proverb, so he who neglects <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and hides it without culture, is properly cast out as a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and unthankful person. On this account, he praises those who increased [their talents], saying, 'Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful in a little, I will place you over much; enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your Lord <span class="stiki" id="note283987"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;25:23</a></span>.'</p>

<p>3. This was right and reasonable; for, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> declares, they had gained as much as they had received. Now, my beloved, our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> ought to keep pace with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not fall short; lest while our <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> remains idle, the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given us should begin to depart, and the enemy finding us empty and naked, should enter [into us], as was the case with him spoken of in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, from whom the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> went out; 'for having gone through dry places, he took seven other spirits more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> than himself; and returning and finding the house empty, he dwelt there, and the last state of that man was worse than the first. ' For the departure from <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> gives place for the entrance of the unclean spirit. There is, moreover, the apostolic injunction, that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given us should not be unprofitable; for those things which he wrote particularly to his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, he enforces on us through him , saying, 'Neglect not the gift that is in you. For he who tills his land shall be satisfied with bread; but the paths of the <a href="../cathen/14057c.htm">slothful</a> are strewn with thorns;' so that the Spirit forewarns a man not to fall into them, saying, 'Break up your fallow ground, sow not among thorns. ' For when a man despises the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given him; and immediately  falls into the cares of the world, he delivers himself over to his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>; and thus in the time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> he is offended , and becomes altogether unfruitful. Now the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> points out the end of such negligence, saying, 'Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord carelessly <span class="stiki" id="note283992"><a href="../bible/jer048.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;48:10</a></span>.' For a servant of the Lord should be diligent and careful, yea, moreover, burning like a flame, so that when, by an ardent spirit, he has destroyed all carnal <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he may be able to draw near to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> who, according to the expression of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, is called 'a consuming fire. '</p>

<p>4. Therefore, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, 'Who makes His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> [spirits],' is a spirit, 'and His ministers a flame of fire. ' Wherefore, in the departure from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, He forbade the multitude to touch the mountain, where God was appointing them the law, because they were not of this character. But He called blessed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> to it, as being fervent in spirit, and possessing unquenchable <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, saying, 'Let <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> alone draw near <span class="stiki" id="note283995"><a href="../bible/exo024.htm#verse2">Exodus&nbsp;24:2</a></span>.' He entered into the cloud also, and when the mountain was smoking, he was not injured; but rather, through 'the words of the Lord, which are choice silver purified in the earth ,' he descended purified. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, when desirous that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Spirit given to us should not grow cold, exhorts, saying, 'Quench not the Spirit <span class="stiki" id="note283997"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:19</a></span>.' For so shall we remain partakers of Christ , if we hold fast to the end the Spirit given at the beginning. For he said, 'Quench not;' not because the Spirit is placed in the power of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and is able to suffer anything from them; but because bad and unthankful men are such as manifestly wish to quench it, since they, like the impure, <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> the Spirit with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. 'For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit of discipline will flee deceit, nor dwell in a body that is subject unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; but will remove from thoughts that are without understanding <span class="stiki" id="note283999"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom&nbsp;1:5</a></span>.' Now they being without understanding, and deceitful, and lovers of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, walk still as in darkness, not having that 'Light which lights every man that comes into the world <span class="stiki" id="note284000"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;1:9</a></span>.' Now a fire such as this laid hold of <a href="../cathen/08334a.htm">Jeremiah the prophet</a>, when the word was in him as a fire, and he said, 'I pass away from every place, and am not able to endure it. ' And <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, being good and a lover of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, came that He might cast this upon earth, and said, 'And what? Would that it were already kindled <span class="stiki" id="note284002"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;12:49</a></span>!' For He desired, as He testified in Ezekiel , the repentance of a man rather than his death; so that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should be entirely consumed in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, being purified, might be able to bring forth fruit; for the word which is sown by Him will be productive, some thirty, some sixty, some an hundred. <span class="stiki" id="note284004"><a href="../bible/mar004.htm#verse20">Mark&nbsp;4:20</a></span> Thus, for instance, those who were with Cleopas <span class="stiki" id="note284005"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm">Luke&nbsp;xxiv</a></span>, although infirm at first from lack of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, yet afterwards were inflamed with the words of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and brought forth the fruits of the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> also, when seized by this fire, revealed it not to flesh and blood, but having experienced the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he became a preacher of the Word. But not such were those nine <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> who were cleansed from their <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, and yet were unthankful to the Lord who healed them; nor Judas, who obtained the lot of an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, and was named a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the Lord, but at last, 'while eating bread with the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, lifted up his heel against Him, and became a traitor. ' But such men have the due reward of their folly, since their expectation will be vain through their ingratitude; for there is no hope for the ungrateful, the last fire, prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, awaits those who have neglected divine light. Such then is the end of the unthankful.</p>

<p>5. But the faithful and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> servants of the Lord, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the Lord loves the thankful, never cease to praise Him, ever giving thanks unto the Lord. And whether the time is one of ease or of affliction, they offer up praise to God with thanksgiving, not reckoning these things of time, but worshipping the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of times.  Thus of old time, Job, who possessed <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, thought of these things when in prosperity; and when in adversity, he patiently endured, and when he suffered, gave thanks. As also the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> David, in the very time of affliction sang praises and said, 'I will bless the Lord at all times. ' And the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, in all his Epistles, so to say, ceased not to thank God. In times of ease, he failed not, and in afflictions he gloried, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that 'tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and that hope makes not ashamed <span class="stiki" id="note284009"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;5:3</a></span>.' Let us, being followers of such men, pass no season without thanksgiving, but especially now, when the time is one of tribulation, which the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> excite against us, will we praise the Lord, uttering the words of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; 'All these things have come upon us, yet have we not forgotten You. ' For as the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> at that time, although suffering an assault from the tabernacles  of the Edomites, and oppressed by the enemies of Jerusalem, did not give themselves up, but all the more sang praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so we, my beloved brethren, though hindered from speaking the word of the Lord, will the more proclaim it, and being afflicted, we will sing Psalms , in that we are accounted worthy to be despised, and to labour anxiously for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Yea, moreover, being grievously vexed, we will give thanks. For the blessed Apostle, who gave thanks at all times, urges us in the same manner to draw near to God saying, 'Let your requests, with thanksgiving, be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto God <span class="stiki" id="note284013"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;4:6</a></span>.' And being desirous that we should always continue in this resolution, he says, 'At all times give thanks; <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing <span class="stiki" id="note284014"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:17</a></span>.' For he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are strong while employed in thanksgiving, and that rejoicing they pass over the walls of the enemy, like those <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who said, 'Through You will we pierce through our enemies, and by my God I will leap over a wall. ' At all times let us stand firm, but especially now, although many afflictions overtake us, and many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> against us. Let us then, my beloved brethren, celebrate with thanksgiving the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> feast which now draws near to us, 'girding up the loins of our minds <span class="stiki" id="note284016"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:13</a></span>,' like our Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, of Whom it is written, 'Righteousness shall be the girdle of His loins, and faithfulness the girdle of His reins <span class="stiki" id="note284017"><a href="../bible/isa011.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;11:5</a></span>.' Each one of us having in his hand the staff which came out of the root of Jesse, and our feet shod with the preparation of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> , let us keep the feast as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, 'Not with the old leaven, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284019"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:8</a></span>;' reverently trusting that we are reconciled through Christ, and not departing from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Him, nor do we defile ourselves together with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and strangers to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, whose conversation and whose will degrade them. But rejoicing in afflictions, we break through the furnace of iron and darkness, and pass, unharmed, over that terrible <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>. Thus also, when we look upon the confusion of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, we shall, with <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, sing that great song of praise, and say, 'We will sing unto the Lord, for He is to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> praised <span class="stiki" id="note284020"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;15:1</a></span>.' Thus, singing praises, and seeing that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is in us has been cast into the sea, we pass over to the wilderness. And being first purified by the fast of forty days, by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, and discipline, and good works, we shall be able to eat the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>6. The beginning of the fast of forty days is on the fifth of Phamenoth <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm">Mark 1</a></span>; and when, as I have said, we have first been purified and prepared by those days, we begin the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> week of the great <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> on the tenth of Pharmuthi (Apr. 5), in which, my beloved brethren, we should use more prolonged <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a>, and watchings, that we may be enabled to anoint our lintels with precious blood, and to escape the destroyer. <span class="stiki" id="note284021"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;12:7,&nbsp;23</a></span> Let us rest then, on the fifteenth of the month Pharmuthi (Apr. 10), for on the evening of that Saturday we hear the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> message, 'Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is risen <span class="stiki" id="note284022"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse5">Luke&nbsp;24:5</a></span>.' Immediately afterwards that great Sunday receives us, I mean on the sixteenth of the same month Pharmuthi (April 11), on which our Lord having risen, gave us peace towards our neighbours.
