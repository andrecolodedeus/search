<h1>Letter 40</h1>

<p><strong>To Marcella</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Onasus, of Segesta, the subject of this letter, was among Jerome's Roman opponents. He is here held up to ridicule in a manner which reflects little credit on the writer's urbanity. The date of the letter is 385 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. The medical men called surgeons pass for being cruel, but really deserve pity. For is it not pitiful to cut away the dead flesh of another man with merciless knives without being moved by his pangs? Is it not pitiful that the man who is curing the patient is callous to his sufferings, and has to appear as his enemy? Yet such is the order of nature. While <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is always bitter, pleasantness waits upon evil-doing. Isaiah goes naked without blushing as a type of captivity to come. <span class="stiki" id="note300858"><a href="../bible/isa020.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;20:2</a></span> Jeremiah is sent from Jerusalem to the Euphrates (a river in Mesopotamia), and leaves his girdle to be marred in the Chald&aelig;an camp, among the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> hostile to his people. <span class="stiki" id="note300859"><a href="../bible/jer013.htm#verse6">Jeremiah&nbsp;13:6-7</a></span> Ezekiel is told to eat bread made of mingled seeds and sprinkled with the dung of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and cattle. <span class="stiki" id="note300860"><a href="../bible/eze004.htm#verse9">Ezekiel&nbsp;4:9-16</a></span> He has to see his wife die without shedding a tear. <span class="stiki" id="note300861"><a href="../bible/eze024.htm#verse15">Ezekiel&nbsp;24:15-18</a></span> Amos is driven from <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaria</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300862"><a href="../bible/amo007.htm#verse12">Amos&nbsp;7:12-13</a></span> Why is he driven from it? Surely in this case as in the others, because he was a spiritual surgeon, who cut away the parts diseased by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and urged men to repentance. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says: <q>Am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300863"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> And so the Saviour Himself found it, from whom many of the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> went back because His sayings seemed hard. <span class="stiki" id="note300864"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse60">John&nbsp;6:60,&nbsp;66</a></span> </p>

<p>2. It is not surprising, then, that by exposing their faults I have offended many. I have arranged to operate on a cancerous nose;  let him who suffers from wens tremble. I wish to rebuke a chattering daw; let the crow realize that she is offensive.  Yet, after all, is there but one person in Rome</p>

<blockquote><p>Whose nostrils are disfigured by a scar? </p></blockquote>

<p>Is Onasus of Segesta alone in puffing out his cheeks like bladders and balancing hollow phrases on his tongue?</p>

<p>I say that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have, by crime, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, and false pretences, attained to this or that high position. How does it hurt you who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the charge does not touch you? I laugh at a pleader who has no clients, and sneer at a penny-a-liner's eloquence. What does it matter to you who are such a refined speaker? It is my whim to inveigh against mercenary <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. You are rich already, why should you be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>? I wish to shut up Vulcan and burn him in his own flames. Are you his guest or his neighbor that you try to save an idol's shrine from the fire? I choose to make merry over ghosts and owls and monsters of the Nile; and whatever I say, you take it as aimed at you. At whatever fault I point my pen, you cry out that you are meant. You collar me and drag me into court and absurdly charge me with writing satires when I only write plain prose!</p>

<p>So you really think yourself a pretty fellow just because you have a lucky name!  Why it does not follow at all. A broke is called a broke just because the light does not break through it.  The Fates are called <q>sparers,</q>  just because they never spare. The Furies are spoken of as gracious,  because they show no <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. And in common speech <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> go by the name of silverlings. Still, if the showing up of faults always angers you, I will soothe you now with the words of Persius: <q>May you be a catch for my lord and lady's daughter! May the pretty ladies scramble for you! May the ground you walk on turn to a rose-bed!</q> </p>

<p>3. All the same, I will give you a hint what features to hide if you want to look your best. Show no nose upon your face and keep your mouth shut. You will then stand some chance of being counted both handsome and eloquent.</p>
