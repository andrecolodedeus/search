<h1>Letter 40</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">St. Ambrose begs Theodosius to listen to him, as he cannot be silent without great risk to both. He points out that Theodosius though God-fearing may be led astray, and points out that his decision respecting the restoration of the Jewish <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> is full of peril, exposing the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the danger of either acting against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or of death. The case of Julian is referred to, and the reasons given for the imperial rescript are met, especially by the plea that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> had burnt many churches. St. Ambrose touches on the temple of the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>, whom he declares to be worse than <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and points out what a door would be opened to the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and a triumph over Christ Himself. The Emperor is lastly warned by the example of Maximus not to take the part of <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and is urged to clemency.</span> </p>

<p>Ambrose, Bishop, to the most clement prince, and blessed Emperor, Theodosius the Augustus.</p>

<p>1. I am continually harassed by almost incessant cares, most blessed Emperor, but I have never been in such anxiety as at present, since I see that I must take heed that there be nothing which may be ascribed to me savouring even of sacrilege. And so I entreat you to listen with patience to what I say. For, if I am unworthy to be heard by you, I am unworthy to offer for you, who have been entrusted by you with your vows and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. Will you not yourself hear him whom you wish to be heard for you? Will you not hear him pleading his own <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whom you have heard for others? And do you not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for your own decision, lest by thinking him unworthy to be heard by you, you make him unworthy to be heard for you?</p>

<p>2. But it is neither the part of an emperor to refuse liberty of speech, nor of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> not to say what he thinks. For there is nothing in you emperors so popular and so estimable as to appreciate freedom in those even who are in subjection to you by military <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>. For this is the difference between good and bad princes, that the good <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> liberty, the bad slavery. And there is nothing in a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> so full of peril as regards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or so base in the opinion of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, as not freely to declare what he thinks. For it is written: <q>I spoke of Your testimonies before kings, and was not ashamed;</q>  and in another place: <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>, I have set You a watchman unto the house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, in order,</q> it is said, <q>that if the righteous does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, because you have not given him warning,</q> that is, hast not told him what to guard against, <q>the memory of his righteousness shall not be retained, and I will require his blood at your hand. But if you warn the righteous that he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not, and he does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the righteous shall surely live because you have warned him, and you shall deliver your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> </p>

<p>3. I had rather then, O Emperor, have fellowship with you in good than in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and therefore the silence of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> ought to displease your Clemency, and his freedom to please you. For you are involved in the risk of my silence, but are aided by the benefit of my freedom. I am not, then, officiously intruding in things where I ought not, nor interfering in the affairs of others. I am <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a> the commands of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And I do this first of all out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for you, good-will toward you, and desire of preserving your well-doing. If I am not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in this, or am forbidden to act on this feeling, I speak in very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of offending God. For if my peril would set you free, I would patiently offer myself for you, though not willingly, for I had rather that without my peril you might be acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>. But if the guilt of silence and dissimulation on my part would both weigh me down and not set you free, I had rather that you should think me too importunate, than useless and base. Since it is written, as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, whose teaching you cannot controvert: <q>Be instant, in season, out of season, reprove, entreat, rebuke with all patience and doctrine.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343552"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:2</a></span> </p>

<p>4. We, then, also have One Whom it is even more perilous to displease, especially since even emperors are not displeased when every one discharges his own office, and you patiently listen to every one making suggestions in his own sphere, nay, you rebuke him if he act not according to the order of his service. Can this, then, seem to you offensive in <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, which you willingly accept from those who serve you; since we speak not what we wish, but what we are bidden? For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the passage: <q>When you shall stand before kings and rulers, take no thought what you shall speak, for it shall be given you in that hour what you shall speak; for it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father Who speaks in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343553"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;10:19-20</a></span> And if I were speaking in state causes, although <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> must be observed even in them, I should not feel such dread if I were not listened to, but in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of God whom will you listen to, if not to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, at whose greater peril <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed? Who will dare to tell you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> if the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> dare not?</p>

<p>5. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are Godfearing, merciful, gentle, and calm, having the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God at heart, but often some things escape our notice. <q>Some have a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343554"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;10:2</a></span> And I think that we ought to take care lest this also come upon faithful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, your lenity towards men, I myself am bound by the benefits of your favour. And therefore I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the more, I am the more anxious; lest even you condemn me hereafter by your own judgment, because through my want of openness or my flattery you should not have avoided some fault. If I saw that you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against me, I ought not to keep silence, for it is written: <q>If your brother <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against you, rebuke him at first, then chide him sharply before two or three witnesses. If he will not hear you, tell the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</q>  Shall I, then, keep silence in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of God? Let us, then, consider what I have to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>.</p>

<p>6. A report was made by the military Count of the East that a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> had been burnt, and that this was done at the instigation of the Bishop. You gave command that the others should be punished, and the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> be rebuilt by the Bishop himself. I do not urge that the Bishop's account ought to have been waited for, for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are the calmers of disturbances, and anxious for peace, except when even they are moved by some offense against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or insult to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Let us suppose that that Bishop was too eager in the matter of burning the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and too timid at the judgment-seat, are not you afraid, O Emperor, lest he comply with your sentence, lest he fail in his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>?</p>

<p>7. Are you not also afraid, lest, which will happen, he oppose your Count with a refusal? He will then be <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make him either an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>  or a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, either of these alien to the times, either of them equivalent to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, if he be compelled either to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a> or to undergo <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. You see in what direction the issue of the matter inclines. If you think the Bishop firm, guard against making a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> of a firm man; if you think him vacillating, avoid causing the fall of one who is frail. For he has a heavy responsibility who has caused the weak to fall.</p>

<p>8. Having, then, thus stated the two sides of the matter, suppose that the said Bishop says that he himself kindled the fire,  collected the crowd, gathered the people together, in order not to lose an opportunity of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and instead of the weak to put forward a stronger athlete. O <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, whereby one gains for others acquittal, for himself <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>! This it is, O Emperor, which I, too, have requested, that you would rather take vengeance on me, and if you consider this a crime, would attribute it to me. Why order judgment against one who is absent? You have the guilty man present, you hear his confession. I declare that I set fire to the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, or at least that I ordered those who did it, that there might not be a place where Christ was denied. If it be objected to me that I did not set the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> on fire here, I answer, it began to be burnt by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and my work came to an end. And if the very <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be asked, I was the more slack because I did not expect that it would be punished. Why should I do that which as it was unavenged would also be without reward? These words hurt modesty but recall <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, lest that be done whereby an offense against God most High may be committed.</p>

<p>9. But let it be granted that no one will cite the Bishop to the performance of this task, for I have asked this of your Clemency, and although I have not yet read that this edict is revoked, let us notwithstanding assume that it is revoked. What if others more timid offer that the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> be restored at their cost; or that the Count, having found this previously determined, himself orders it to be rebuilt out of the funds of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>? You, O Emperor, will have an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> Count, and to him will you entrust the victorious standards? Will you entrust the labarum, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as it is by the Name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to one who restores the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not Christ? Order the labarum to be carried into the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, and let us see if they do not resist.</p>

<p>10. Shall, then, a place be made for the unbelief of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> out of the spoils of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and shall the patrimony, which by the favour of Christ has been gained for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, be transferred to the treasuries of unbelievers? We read that of old temples were built for <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> of the plunder taken from Cimbri, and the spoils of other enemies. Shall the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> write this inscription on the front of their <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>: <q>The temple of impiety, erected from the plunder of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a></q>?</p>

<p>11. But, perhaps, the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of discipline moves you, O Emperor. Which, then, is of greater importance, the show of discipline or the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of religion? It is needful that judgment should yield to religion.</p>

<p>12. Have you not heard, O Emperor, how, when Julian had commanded that the temple of Jerusalem should be restored, those who were clearing the rubbish were consumed by fire?  Will you not beware lest this happen now again? For you ought not to have commanded what Julian commanded.</p>

<p>13. But what is your motive? Is it because a public building of whatever kind has been burnt, or because it was a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>? If you are moved by the burning of a building of no importance (for what could there be in so mean a town?), do you not remember, O Emperor, how many prefects' houses have been burnt at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and no one inflicted punishment for it? And, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if any emperor had desired to punish the deed sharply, he would have injured the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of him who had suffered so great a loss. Which, then, is more fitting, that a fire in some part of the buildings of Callinicum, or of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, should be punished, if indeed it were right at all? At Constantinople lately, the house of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> was burnt and your Clemency's son interceded with his father, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> that you would not avenge the insult offered to him, that is, to the son of the emperor, and the burning of the episcopal house. Do you not consider, O Emperor, that if you were to order this deed to be punished, he would again intervene against the punishment? That favour was, however, fittingly obtained by the son from the father, for it was worthy of him first to forgive the injury done to himself. That was a good division in the distribution of favour, that the son should be entreated for his own loss, the father for that of the son. Here there is nothing for you to keep back for your son. Take heed, then, lest you derogate anything from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>14. There is, then, no adequate <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for such a commotion, that the people should be so severely punished for the burning of a building, and much less since it is the burning of a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a>, a home of unbelief, a house of impiety, a receptacle of folly, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself has condemned. For thus we read, where the Lord our God speaks by the mouth of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jeremiah: <q>And I will do to this house, which is called by My Name, wherein you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh, and I will cast you forth from My sight, as I cast forth your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim. And do not <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for that people, and do not ask mercy for them, and do not come near Me on their behalf, for I will not hear you. Or do you not see what they do in the cities of Judah?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343559"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse14">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:14</a></span> God forbids intercession to be made for those.</p>

<p>15. And certainly, if I were pleading according to the law of nations, I could tell how many of the Church's basilicas the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> burnt in the time of the Emperor Julian: two at Damascus, one of which is scarcely now repaired, and this at the cost of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not of the Synagogue; the other <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> still is a rough mass of shapeless ruins. Basilicas were burnt at Gaza, <a href="../cathen/01766b.htm">Ascalon</a>, Berytus, and in almost every place in those parts, and no one demanded punishment. And at Alexandria a <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> was burnt by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, which surpassed all the rest. The Church was not avenged, shall the Synagogue be so?</p>

<p>16. Shall, then, the burning of the temple of the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> be also avenged? But what is but a temple in which is a gathering of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>? Although the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> invoke twelve gods, the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> worship thirty-two <a href="../cathen/01173c.htm">&AElig;ons</a> whom they call gods. And I have found out concerning these also that it is reported and ordered that some <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> should be punished, who, when the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a> were stopping the road on which, according to custom and ancient use, they were singing psalms as they went to celebrate the festival of the Maccabees, enraged by their insolence, burnt their hurriedly-built temple in some country village.</p>

<p>17. How many have to offer themselves to such a choice, when they remember that in the time of Julian, he who threw down an altar, and disturbed a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, was condemned by the judge and suffered <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>? And so the judge who heard him was never esteemed other than a prosecutor, for no one thought him worthy of being associated with, or of a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. And if he were not now dead, I should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, O Emperor, that you would take vengeance on him, although he escaped not the vengeance of heaven, outliving his own heir.</p>

<p>18. But it is related that the judge was ordered to take cognizance of the matter, and that it was written that he ought not to have reported the deed, but to have punished it, and that the money chests which had been taken away should be demanded. I will omit other matters. The buildings of our churches were burnt by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and nothing was restored, nothing was asked back, nothing demanded. But what could the Synagogue have possessed in a far distant town, when the whole of what there is there is not much; there is nothing of value, and no abundance? And what then could the scheming <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> lose by the fire? These are artifices of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who wish to <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> us, that because of their complaints, an extraordinary military inquiry may be ordered, and a soldier sent, who will, perhaps, say what one said once here, O Emperor, before your accession: <q>How will Christ be able to help us who fight for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who are sent to avenge the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? They have destroyed their own armies, and wish to destroy ours.</q></p>

<p>19. Further, into what <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> will they not break out, who by false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> even Christ? Into what <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> will not men break out who are liars, even in things belonging to God? Whom will they not say to have been the instigators of that sedition? Whom will they not assail, even of those whom they recognize not, that may gaze upon the numberless ranks of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in chains, that they may see the necks of the faithful people bowed in captivity, that the servants of God may be concealed in darkness, may be beheaded, given over to the fire, delivered to the mines, that their sufferings may not quickly pass away?</p>

<p>20. Will you give this triumph over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>? This trophy over Christ's people, this exultation, O Emperor, to the unbelievers? This rejoicing to the Synagogue, this sorrow to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? The people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> will set this <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> among their feast-days, and will doubtless number it among those on which they triumphed either over the Amorites, or the <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Canaanites</a>, or were delivered from the hand of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, King of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, or of Nebuchodonosor, King of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>. They will add this <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>, in memory of their having triumphed over the people of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>21. And whereas they deny that they themselves are bound by the Roman <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and repute those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> as criminal, yet now they think that they ought to be avenged, as it were, by the Roman <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Where were those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> when they themselves set fire to the roofs of the sacred basilicas? If Julian did not avenge the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> because he was an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, will you, O Emperor, avenge the injury done to the Synagogue, because you are a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>?</p>

<p>22. And what will Christ say to you afterwards? Do you not remember what He said by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Nathan to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David?  <q>I have chosen you the youngest of your brethren, and from a private man have made you emperor. I have placed of the fruit of your seed on the imperial throne. I have made barbarous nations subject unto you, I have given you peace, I have delivered your enemy captive into your power. You had no grain for provision for your army, I opened to you the gates, I opened to you their stores by the hand of the enemies themselves. Your enemies gave to you their provisions which they had prepared for themselves. I troubled the counsels of your enemy, so that he made himself bare. I so fettered the usurper of the empire himself and bound his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that while he still had means of escape, yet with all belonging to him, as though for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest any should escape you, he shut himself in. His officer and forces on the other element,  whom before I had scattered, that they might not join to fight against you, I brought together again to complete your victory. Your army, gathered together from many unsubdued nations, I bade keep <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, tranquillity, and concord as if of one nation. When there was the greatest danger lest the perfidious designs of the barbarians should penetrate the Alps, I conferred victory on you within the very wall of the Alps, that you might conquer without loss. Thus, then, I caused you to triumph over your enemy, and you give My enemies a triumph over My people.</q></p>

<p>23. Is it not on this account that Maximus was forsaken, who, before the days of the expedition, hearing that a <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> had been burnt in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, had sent an edict to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, as if he were the upholder of public order? Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people said, No good is in store for him. That king has become a Jew, we have heard of him as a defender of order, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Who died for sinners, soon tested him. If this was said of words, what will be said of punishment? And then at once he was overcome by the Franks and the Saxons, in <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a>, at Siscia, at Petavio, in a word everywhere. What has the believer in common with the unbeliever? The instances of his unbelief ought to be done away with together with the unbeliever himself. That which injured him, that wherein he who was conquered offended, the conqueror ought not to follow but to condemn.</p>

<p>24. I have, then, recounted these things not as to one who is ungrateful, but have enumerated them as rightly bestowed, in order that, warned by them, you, to whom more has been given, may <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> more. When Simon answered in these words the Lord Jesus said: <q>You have judged rightly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343562"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;7:43</a></span> And straightway turning to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who anointed His feet with ointment, setting forth a type of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, He said to Simon: <q>Wherefore I say unto you, her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which are many are forgiven, since she loved much. But he to whom less is forgiven loves less.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343563"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;7:47</a></span> This is the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who entered into the house of the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a>, and cast off the Jew, but gained Christ. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shut out the Synagogue, why is it now again attempted that in the servant of Christ the Synagogue should exclude the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the bosom of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, from the house of Christ?</p>

<p>25. I have brought these matters together in this address, O Emperor, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for you. For I owe it to your kindnesses (whereby, at my request, you have liberated many from exile, from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, from the extreme penalty of death) that I should not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> even offending your feelings for the sake of your own <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> (no one has greater confidence than he who loves from his heart, certainly no one ought to injure him who takes thought for him); that I may not lose in one moment that favour granted to every <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and received by me for so many years; and yet it is not the loss of favour which I deprecate but the peril to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>26. And yet how great a thing it is, O Emperor, that you should not think it necessary to enquire or to punish in regard to a matter as to which up to this day no one has enquired, no one has ever inflicted punishment. It is a serious matter to endanger your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. When Gideon  had slain the sacred calf, the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> said, The gods will themselves avenge the injury done to them. Who is to avenge the Synagogue? Christ, Whom they slew, Whom they denied? Will <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father avenge those who do not receive the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, since they have not received the Son? Who is to avenge the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>? How can your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> avenge them, seeing it has commanded them to be excluded, and denied them permission to meet together? If I set before you Josiah as a king approved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will you condemn that in them which was approved in him? </p>

<p>27. But at any rate if too little confidence is placed in me, command the presence of those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom you think fit, let it be discussed, O Emperor, what ought to be done without injury to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. If you consult your officers concerning pecuniary causes, how much more just is it that you should consult the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of religion.</p>

<p>28. Let your Clemency consider from how many plotters, how many spies the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> suffers. If they come upon a slight crack, they plant a dart in it. I speak after the manner of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is feared more than men, Who is rightly set before even emperors. If any one thinks it right that deference should be paid to a friend, a parent, or a neighbour, I am right in judging that deference should be paid to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that He should be preferred to all. Consult, O Emperor, your own advantage, or suffer me to consult mine.</p>

<p>29. What shall I answer hereafter, if it be discovered that, by authority given from this place, <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> have been slain by the sword, or by clubs, or thongs knotted with lead? How shall I explain such a fact? How shall I excuse it to those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who now mourn bitterly because some, who have discharged the office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> for thirty and many more years, or other ministers of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are withdrawn from their sacred office, and set to discharge municipal duties?  For if they who <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for you serve for a stated time of service, how much more ought you to consider those who <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> for God. How, I say, shall I excuse this to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, who make complaint concerning the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, and write that the Churches are wasted by a serious attack upon them?</p>

<p>30. I was desirous that this should come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of your Clemency. You will, when it pleases you, vouchsafe to consider and give order according to your will, but exclude and cast out that which troubles me, and troubles me rightly. You do yourself whatever you order to be done, even if he, your officer, do not do it. I much prefer that you should be merciful, than that he should not do what he has been ordered.</p>

<p>31. You have those  for whom you ought yet to invite and to merit the mercy of the Lord in regard to the Roman Empire; you have those for whom you hope even more than for yourself; let the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God for them, let their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> appeal to you in these words of mine. I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that you may commit your <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to the judgment of others. Everything is still unprejudiced before you. On this point I pledge myself to our God for you, do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> your <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.  Is it possible that that should displease God which is amended for His <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>? You need not alter anything in that letter, whether it be sent or is not yet sent. Order another to be written, which shall be full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, full of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For you it is possible to change for the better, for me it is not possible to hide the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>32. You forgave the <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antiochians</a> the insult offered to you;  you have recalled the daughters of your enemy, and given them to be brought up by a relative; you sent sums of money to the mother of your enemy from your own treasury. This so great <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, this so great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will be darkened by this deed. Do not you, then, I entreat, who spared enemies in arms, and preserved your adversaries, think that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> ought to be punished with such eagerness.</p>

<p>33. And now, O Emperor, I beg you not to disdain to hear me who am in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> both for yourself and for myself, for it is the voice of a Saint which says: <q>Wherefore was I made to see the misery of my people?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note343570"><a href="../bible/1ma002.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;2:7</a></span> that I should commit an offense against God. I, indeed, have done what could be done consistently with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to you, that you might rather listen to me in the palace, lest, if it were necessary, you should listen to me in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
