<h1>Letter 41</h1>

<p><strong>To Marcella</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">An effort having been made to convert Marcella to Montanism,  Jerome here summarizes for her its leading doctrines, which he contrasts with those of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 385 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. As regards the passages brought together from the gospel of John with which a certain votary of <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> has assailed you, passages in which our Saviour promises that He will go to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that He will send the Paraclete &mdash; as regards these, the Acts of the Apostles inform us both for what time the promises were made, and at what time they were actually fulfilled. Ten days had elapsed, we are told, from the Lord's ascension and fifty from His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> came down, and the tongues of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> were cloven, so that each spoke every language. Then it was that, when certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of those who as yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not declared that the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunk</a> with new wine, Peter standing in the midst of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and of all the concourse said: <q>You men of Jud&aelig;a and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> unto you and hearken to my words: for these are not drunken as you suppose, seeing it is but the <a href="../cathen/14514c.htm">third hour</a> of the day. But this is that which was spoken of by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Joel. And it shall come to pass in the last days, says <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: and on my servants, and on my handmaidens I will pour out...of my spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300875"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse14">Acts&nbsp;2:14-18</a></span> </p>

<p>2. If, then, the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, upon whom the Lord has founded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300876"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> has expressly said that the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> and promise of the Lord were then and there fulfilled, how can we claim another fulfilment for ourselves? If the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> reply that Philip's four daughters prophesied <span class="stiki" id="note300877"><a href="../bible/act021.htm#verse9">Acts&nbsp;21:9</a></span> at a later date, and that a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is mentioned named <a href="../cathen/01200a.htm">Agabus</a>,  and that in the partition of the spirit, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> are spoken of as well as <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, teachers and others,  and that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> himself prophesied many things concerning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> still future, and the end of the world; we tell them that we do not so much reject <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>&mdash; for this is attested by the passion of the Lord&mdash; as refuse to receive <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> whose utterances fail to accord with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> old and new.</p>

<p>3. In the first place we differ from the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> regarding the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We distinguish the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as three <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but unite them as one substance. They, on the other hand, following the doctrine of Sabellius,  force the Trinity into the narrow limits of a single personality. We, while we do not encourage them, yet allow second marriages, since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bids the younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> to marry. <span class="stiki" id="note300881"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:14</a></span> They suppose a repetition of marriage a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so awful that he who has committed it is to be regarded as an adulterer. We, according to the apostolic tradition (in which the whole world is at one with us), fast through one Lent yearly; whereas they keep three in the year as though three saviours had suffered. I do not mean, of course, that it is unlawful to fast at other times through the year&mdash; always excepting Pentecost &mdash; only that while in Lent it is a duty of obligation, at other seasons it is a matter of choice. With us, again, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> occupy the place of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, but with them a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ranks not first but third. For while they put first the patriarchs of Pepusa  in Phrygia, and place next to these the ministers called stewards,  the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are relegated to the third or almost the lowest rank. No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> their object is to make their religion more pretentious by putting that last which we put first. Again they close the doors of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to almost every fault, while we read daily, <q>I desire the repentance of a sinner rather than his death,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300885"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse23">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:23</a></span> and <q>Shall they fall and not arise, says the Lord,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300886"><a href="../bible/jer008.htm#verse4">Jeremiah&nbsp;8:4</a></span> and once more <q>Return ye backsliding children and I will heal your backslidings.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300887"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse22">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:22</a></span> Their strictness does not prevent them from themselves committing grave <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, far from it; but there is this difference between us and them, that, whereas they in their self-righteousness blush to confess their faults, we do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a> for ours, and so more readily gain pardon for them.</p>

<p>4. I pass over their <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>  of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, made up as they are said to be, of sucking children subjected to a triumphant <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.  I prefer, I say, not to credit these; accusations of blood-shedding may well be false. But I must confute the open <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of men who say that God first determined in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> to save the world by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, but that finding Himself unable to fulfil His purpose He took to Himself a body of the Virgin, and preaching under the form of the Son in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, underwent death for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Moreover that, when by these two steps He was unable to save the world, He last of all descended by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> upon <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and those demented <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> Prisca and Maximilia; and that thus the mutilated and emasculate  <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> possessed a fullness of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> such as was never claimed by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; for he was content to say, <q>We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in part, and we prophesy in part,</q> and again, <q>Now we see through a glass darkly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300891"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:9,&nbsp;12</a></span> </p>

<p>These are statements which require no refutation. To expose the infidelity of the <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanists</a> is to triumph over it. Nor is it necessary that in so short a letter as this I should overthrow the several absurdities which they bring forward. You are well acquainted with the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>; and, as I take it, you have written, not because you have been disturbed by their cavils, but only to learn my opinion about them.</p>
