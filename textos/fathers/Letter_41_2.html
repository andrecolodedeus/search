<h1>Letter 41</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>Basil to Julian</em>.</p>

<p>1. The heroic <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of your present splendour are small, and your grand attack against me, or rather against yourself, is paltry. When I think of you robed in purple, a crown on your dishonoured head, which, so long as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion is absent, rather disgraces than graces your empire, I tremble. And you yourself who have risen to be so high and great, now that vile and honour-hating <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have brought you to this pass, have begun not only to exalt yourself above all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, but even to uplift yourself against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and insult His Church, mother and nurse of all, by sending to me, most insignificant of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, orders to forward you a thousand pounds of gold. I am not so much astonished at the weight of the gold, although it is very serious; but it has made me shed bitter tears over your so rapid ruin. I bethink me how you and I have learned together the lessons of the best and holiest books. Each of us went through the sacred and God-inspired Scriptures. Then nothing was hid from you. Nowadays you have become lost to proper feeling, beleaguered as you are with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Your serene Highness did not find out for the first time yesterday that I do not live in the midst of superabundant <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>. Today you have demanded a thousand pounds of gold of me. I hope your serenity will deign to spare me. My property amounts to so much, that I really shall not have enough to eat as much as I shall like today. Under my roof the art of cookery is dead. My servants' knife never touches blood. The most important viands, in which lies our abundance, are leaves of herbs with very coarse bread and sour wine, so that our senses are not dulled by <a href="../cathen/06590a.htm">gluttony</a>, and do not indulge in excess.</p>

<p>2. Your excellent tribune Lausus, trusty minister of your orders, has also reported to me that a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> came as a suppliant to your serenity on the occasion of the death of her son by poison; that it has been judged by you that poisoners are not allowed to exist;  if any there be, that they are to be destroyed, or, only those are reserved, who are to fight with beasts. And, this rightly decided by you, seems strange to me, for your efforts to cure the pain of great wounds by petty remedies are to the last degree ridiculous. After insulting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is useless for you to give heed to <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and <a href="../cathen/11322b.htm">orphans</a>. The former is mad and dangerous; the latter the part of a merciful and kindly man. It is a serious thing for a private individual like myself to speak to an emperor; it will be more serious for you to speak to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. No one will appear to mediate between <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>. What you read you did not understand. If you had understood, you would not have condemned. </p>
