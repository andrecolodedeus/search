<h1>Letter 42</h1>

<p><strong>To Marcella</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">At Marcella's request Jerome explains to her what is <q>the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></q> spoken of by Christ, and shows <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian's</a>  explanation of it to be untenable. Written at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in 385 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. The question you send is short and the answer is clear. There is this passage in the gospel: <q>Whosoever speaks a word against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever speaks against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world nor in the world to come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300893"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;12:32</a></span> Now if <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> affirms that none but <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> renegades can <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it is plain that the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> Christ were not guilty of this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Yet they were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> husbandmen, they had slain the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, they were then compassing the death of the Lord; <span class="stiki" id="note300894"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;21:33</a></span> and so utterly lost were they that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> told them that it was they whom he had come to save. <span class="stiki" id="note300895"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;18:11</a></span> It must be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>, therefore, that the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which shall never be forgiven is not the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of men disembowelled by torture who in their agony deny their Lord, but is the captious clamor of those who, while they see that God's works are the fruit of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, ascribe the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> and declare the signs wrought to belong not to the divine excellence but to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And this is the whole gist of our Saviour's argument, when He teaches that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> cannot be cast out by <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, and that his kingdom is not divided against itself. <span class="stiki" id="note300896"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse25">Matthew&nbsp;12:25-26</a></span> If it is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> object to injure God's creation, how can he wish to cure the sick and to expel himself from the bodies possessed by him? Let <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> prove that of those who have been compelled to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> before a judge's tribunal  any has declared of the things written in the gospel that they were wrought not by the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> but by <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, the prince of the devils; <span class="stiki" id="note300897"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;12:24</a></span> and then he will be able to make good his contention that this  is the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which shall never be forgiven.</p>

<p>2. But to put a more searching question still: let <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> tell us how he distinguishes speaking against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> from <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For I maintain that on his principles men who have denied Christ under <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> have only spoken against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, and have not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For when a man is asked if he is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and declares that he is not; obviously in denying Christ, that is the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a>, he does no despite to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. But if his denial of Christ involves a denial of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> can perhaps tell us how the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> can be denied without sinning against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. If he thinks that we are here intended by the term <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to understand the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, no mention at all of the Father is made by the denier in his denial. When the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a>, taken aback by a maid's question, denied the Lord, did he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of Man</a> or against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? If <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> absurdly twists Peter's words, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not the man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300899"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse74">Matthew&nbsp;26:74</a></span> to mean a denial not of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Messiahship but of His humanity, he will make the Saviour a liar, for He foretold  that He Himself, that is His divine Sonship, must be denied. Now, when Peter denied the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, he wept bitterly and effaced his threefold denial by a threefold confession. <span class="stiki" id="note300901"><a href="../bible/joh021.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;21:15-17</a></span> His <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore, was not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which can never be forgiven. It is obvious, then, that this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> involves <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, calling one <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a> for his actions, whose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> prove him to be God. If <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a> can bring an instance of a renegade who has called Christ <a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>, I will at once give up my position and admit that after such a fall the denier can win no forgiveness. To give way under torture and to deny oneself to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is one thing, to say that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is another. And this you will yourself see if you read the passage  attentively.</p>

<p>3. I ought to have discussed the matter more fully, but some friends have visited my <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> abode, and I cannot refuse to give myself up to them. Still, as it might seem arrogant not to answer you at once, I have compressed a wide subject into a few words, and have sent you not a letter but an explanatory note. </p>
