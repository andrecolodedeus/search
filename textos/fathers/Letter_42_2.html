<h1>Letter 42</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Chilo, his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a></em>.</p>

<p>1. If, my <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> brother, you gladly suffer yourself to be advised by me as to what course of action you should pursue, specially in the points in which you have referred to me for advice, you will owe me your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Many men have had the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to enter upon the solitary life; but to live it out to the end is a task which perhaps has been achieved by few. The end is not necessarily involved in the intention; yet in the end is the reward of the toil. No advantage, therefore, accrues to men who fail to press on to the end of what they have in view and only adopt the solitary's life in its inception. Nay, they make their profession ridiculous, and are charged by outsiders with unmanliness and instability of purpose. Of these, moreover, the Lord says, who wishing to build a house <q>sits not down first and counts the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it? Lest haply after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it,</q> the passers-by <q>begin to mock him saying,</q> this man laid a foundation <q>and was not able to finish.</q>  Let the start, then, mean that you heartily advance in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. The right noble athlete <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, wishing us not to rest in easy security on so much of our life as may have been lived well in the past, but, every day to attain further progress, says <q>Forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322062"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse13">Philippians&nbsp;3:13-14</a></span> So <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> stands the whole of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, not contented with what has gone before and fed not so much on the past as on the future. For how is a man the better for having his belly filled yesterday, if his natural hunger fails to find its proper satisfaction in food today? In the same way the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> gains nothing by yesterday's <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> unless it be followed by the right conduct of today. For it is said <q>I shall judge you as I shall find you.</q></p>

<p>2. Vain then is the labour of the righteous man, and free from blame is the way of the sinner, if a change befall, and the former turn from the better to the worse, and the latter from the worse to the better. So we hear from Ezekiel teaching as it were in the name of the Lord, when he says, <q>if the righteous turns away and commits iniquity, I will not remember the righteousness which he committed before; in his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> he shall die,</q>  and so too about the sinner; if he turn away from his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and do that which is right, he shall live. Where were all the labours of God's servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when the gainsaying of one moment shut him out from entering into the promised land? What became of the companionship of Gehazi with Eliss&aelig;us, when he brought <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> on himself by his <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>? What availed all Solomon's vast wisdom, and his previous regard for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when afterwards from his mad <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> he fell into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>? Not even the blessed David was blameless, when his thoughts went astray and he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against the wife of Uriah. One example were surely enough for keeping safe one who is living a godly life, the fall from the better to the worse of Judas, who, after being so long Christ's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, for a mean gain sold his Master and got a halter for himself. Learn then, brother, that it is not he who begins well who is perfect. It is he who ends well who is approved in God's sight. Give then no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids  that you may be delivered <q>as a roe from the net and a bird from the snare.</q>  For, behold, you are passing through the midst of snares; you are treading on the top of a high wall whence a fall is perilous to the faller; wherefore do not straightway attempt extreme discipline; above all things beware of confidence in yourself, lest you fall from a height of discipline through want of training. It is better to advance a little at a time. Withdraw then by degrees from the pleasures of life, gradually destroying all your wonted habits, lest you bring on yourself a crowd of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> by irritating all your <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> at once. When you have mastered one passion, then begin to wage <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against another, and in this manner you will in good time get the better of all. Indulgence, so far as the name goes, is one, but its practical workings are diverse. First then, brother, meet every <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> with patient endurance. And by what various <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> the faithful man is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>; by worldly loss, by accusations, by lies, by opposition, by <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>, by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>! These and the like are the tests of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. Further, be quiet, not rash in speech, not quarrelsome, not disputatious, not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> of vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, not more anxious to get than to give <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>,  not a man of many words, but always more ready to learn than to teach. Do not trouble yourself about worldly life; from it no good can come to you. It is said, <q>That my mouth speak not the works of men.</q>  The man who is fond of talking about sinners' doings, soon rouses the desire for self indulgence; much better busy yourself about the lives of good men for so you will get some profit for yourself. Do not be anxious to go travelling about  from village to village and house to house; rather avoid them as traps for <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. If any one, for <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> pity's sake, invite you with many pleas to enter his house, let him be told to follow the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the centurion, who, when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> was hastening to him to perform an act of healing, besought him not to do so in the words, <q>Lord I am not worthy that you should come under my roof, but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322069"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;8:8</a></span> and when <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> had said to him <q>Go your way; as you have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, so be it done unto you,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322070"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;8:13</a></span> his servant was healed from that hour. Learn then, brother, that it was the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the suppliant, not the presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which delivered the sick man. So too now, if you <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, in whatever place you be, and the sick man believes that he will be aided by your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, all will fall out as he desires.</p>

<p>3. You will not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your kinsfolk more than the Lord. <q>He that loves,</q> He says, <q>father, or mother, or brother, more than me, is not worthy of me.</q>  What is the meaning of the Lord's commandment? <q>He that takes not up his cross and follows after me, cannot be my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>?</q>  If, together with Christ, you died to your kinsfolk according to the flesh, why do you wish to live with them again? If for your kinsfolk's sake you are building up again what you destroyed for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake, you make yourself a transgressor. Do not then for your kinsfolk's sake abandon your place: if you abandon your place, perhaps you will abandon your mode of life. Love not the crowd, nor the country, nor the town; <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a>, ever abiding by yourself with no wandering <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,  regarding <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and praise as your life's work. Never neglect reading, especially of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, because very frequently mischief comes of reading the Old; not because what is written is harmful, but because the minds of the injured are weak. All bread is nutritious, but it may be injurious to the sick. Just so all Scripture is God inspired and profitable,  and there is nothing in it unclean: only to him who thinks it is unclean, to him it is unclean. <q>Prove all things; hold fast that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; abstain from every form of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q>  <q>All things are lawful but all things are not expedient.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322076"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> Among all, with whom you come in contact, be in all things a giver of no offense,  cheerful, <q>loving as a brother,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322078"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:8</a></span> pleasant, humble-minded, never missing the mark of hospitality through extravagance of meats, but always content with what is at hand. Take no more from any one than the daily necessaries of the solitary life. Above all things shun gold as the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> foe, the father of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and the agent of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Do not expose yourself to the charge of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> on the pretence of ministering to the poor; but, if any one brings you money for the poor and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of any who are in need, advise the owner himself to convey it to his needy brothers, lest haply your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> may be defiled by the acceptance of money.</p>

<p>4. Shun pleasures; seek after continence; train your body to hard work; accustom your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to trials. Regarding the dissolution of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body as release from every <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, await that enjoyment of everlasting <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things in which all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have part. Ever, as it were, holding the balance against every suggestion of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> throw in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thought, and, as the scale inclines do thou go with it. Above all when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought starts up and says, <q>What is the good of your passing your life in this place? What do you gain by withdrawing yourself from the society of men? Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that those, who are ordained by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of God's churches, constantly associate with their fellows, and indefatigably attend spiritual gatherings at which those who are present derive very great advantage? There are to be enjoyed explanations of hard sayings, expositions of the teachings of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, interpretations of the thoughts of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a>, lessons in theology and the intercourse of spiritual brethren, who do great good to all they meet if only by the sight of their faces. You, however, who have decided to be a stranger to all these <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things, are sitting here in a wild state like the beasts. You see round you a wide desert with scarcely a fellow creature in it, lack of all instruction, estrangement from your brothers, and your spirit inactive in carrying out the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Now, when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought rises against you, with all these ingenious pretexts and wishes to destroy you, oppose to it in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> reflection your own practical experience, and say, You tell me that the things in the world are good; the reason why I came here is because I judged myself unfit for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of the world. With the world's <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things are mingled <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things, and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things distinctly have the upper hand. Once when I attended the spiritual assemblies I did with difficulty find one brother, who, so far as I could see, feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but he was a victim of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and I heard from him amusing stories and tales made up to deceive those whom he met. After him I fell in with many thieves, plunderers, tyrants. I saw disgraceful drunkards; I saw the blood of the oppressed; I saw <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> beauty, which tortured my <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. From actual fornication I fled, but I defiled my <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> by the thoughts of my heart. I heard many discourses which were good for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but I could not discover in the case of any one of the teachers that his life was worthy of his words. After this, again, I heard a great number of plays, which were made attractive by wanton songs. Then I heard a lyre sweetly played, the applause of tumblers, the talk of clowns, all kinds of jests and follies and all the noises of a crowd. I saw the tears of the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a>, the agony of the victims of tyranny, the shrieks of the tortured. I looked and lo, there was no spiritual assembly, but only a sea, wind-tossed and agitated, and trying to drown every one at once under its waves.  Tell me, O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought, tell me, d&aelig;mon of short lived pleasure and vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, what is the good of my seeing and hearing all these things, when I am powerless to succour any of those who are thus wronged; when I am allowed neither to defend the helpless nor correct the fallen; when I am perhaps doomed to destroy myself too. For just as a very little fresh water is blown away by a storm of wind and dust, in like manner the good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, that we think we do in this life, are overwhelmed by the multitude of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. Pieces acted for men in this life are driven through <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and merriment, like stakes into their hearts, so that the brightness of their worship is be-dimmed. But the wails and lamentations of men wronged by their fellows are introduced to make a show of the patience of the poor.</p>

<p>5. What good then do I get except the loss of my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? For this reason I migrate to the hills like a bird. <q>I am escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers.</q>  I am living, O <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thought, in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> in which the Lord lived. Here is the oak of Mamre; here is the ladder going up to heaven, and the stronghold of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> which Jacob saw; here is the wilderness in which the people purified received the law, and so came into the land of promise and saw God. Here is Mount Carmel where Elias sojourned and pleased God. Here is the plain whither Esdras withdrew, and at God's bidding uttered all the God inspired books.  Here is the wilderness in which the blessed John ate locusts and preached repentance to men. Here is the <a href="../cathen/11244b.htm">Mount of Olives</a>, whither Christ came and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, and taught us to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>. Here is Christ the lover of the wilderness, for He says <q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them.</q>  <q>Here is the strait and narrow way which leads unto life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322083"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;7:14</a></span> Here are the teachers and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <q>wandering in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322084"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse38">Hebrews&nbsp;11:38</a></span> Here are <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and solitaries' life remote from cities. This I have embraced with all my heart, that I may win what has been promised to Christ's <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> and all His other <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and so I may <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> say, <q>Because of the words of your lips I have kept hard ways.</q>  I have heard of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, God's friend, who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the divine voice and went into the wilderness; of Isaac who submitted to authority; of Jacob, the patriarch, who left his home; of Joseph, the chaste, who was sold; of the three children, who learned how to fast, and fought with the fire; of Daniel thrown twice into the lion's den;  of Jeremiah speaking boldly, and thrown into a pit of mud; of Isaiah, who saw unspeakable things, cut asunder with a saw; of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> led away captive; of John the rebuker of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, beheaded; of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> slain. But why say more? Here our Saviour Himself was crucified for our sakes that by His death He might give us life, and train and attract us all to endurance. To Him I press on, and to the Father and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. I strive to be found <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, judging myself unworthy of this world's goods. And yet not I because of the world, but the world because of me. Think of all these things in your heart; follow them with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>; fight, as you have been commanded, for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to the death. For Christ was made <q><a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a></q> even <q>unto death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322087"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse8">Philippians&nbsp;2:8</a></span> The Apostle says, <q>Take heed lest there be in any of you an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> heart...in departing from the living God. But exhort one another...(and edify one another <span class="stiki" id="note322088"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:11</a></span>) while it is called today.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322089"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse12">Hebrews&nbsp;3:12-13</a></span> Today means the whole time of our life. Thus living, brother, you will save yourself, you will make me glad, and you will glorify God from everlasting to everlasting. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
