<h1>Letter 43 (A.D. 397)</h1>

<p> <em>To Glorius, Eleusius, the Two Felixes, Grammaticus, and All Others to Whom This May Be Acceptable, My Lords Most Beloved and Worthy of Praise, Augustine Sends Greeting.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> has said: <q>A man that is an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> after the first and second admonition reject, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that he that is such is subverted and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, being condemned of himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111626"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus&nbsp;3:10-11</a></span> But though the doctrine which men hold be false and perverse, if they do not maintain it with passionate obstinacy, especially when they have not devised it by the rashness of their own presumption, but have accepted it from <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who had been misguided and had fallen into <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and if they are with anxiety seeking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and are prepared to be set right when they have found it, such men are not to be counted <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Were it not that I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> you to be such, perhaps I would not write to you. And yet even in the case of a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, however puffed up with odious conceit, and insane through the obstinacy of his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> resistance to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, although we warn others to avoid him, so that he may not deceive the weak and inexperienced, we do not refuse to strive by every means in our power for his correction. On this ground I wrote even to some of the chief of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, not indeed letters of communion, which on account of their perversity they have long ceased to receive from the undivided <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is spread throughout the world, but letters of a private kind, such as we may send even to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a>. These letters, however, though they have sometimes read them, they have not been willing, or perhaps it is more probable, have not been able, to answer. In these cases, it seems to me that I have discharged the obligation laid on me by that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> teaches us to render, not only to our own, but to all, saying by the apostle: <q>The Lord make you to increase and abound in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one toward another, and toward all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111627"><a href="../bible/1th003.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;3:12</a></span> In another place we are warned that those who are of a different opinion from us must be corrected with meekness, <q>if God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who are taken captive by him at his will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111628"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse25">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:25-26</a></span> </p>

<p>2. I have said these things by way of preface, lest any one should think, because you are not of our communion, that I have been influenced by forwardness rather than consideration in sending this letter, and in desiring thus to confer with you regarding the welfare of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; though I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, if I were writing to you about an affair of property, or the settlement of some dispute about money, no one would find fault with me. So precious is this world in the esteem of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and so small is the value which they set upon themselves! This letter, therefore, shall be a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in my vindication at the bar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the spirit in which I write, and who has said: <q>Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111629"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;5:9</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>3. I beg you, therefore, to call to mind that, when I was in your town,  and was discussing with you a little concerning the communion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> unity, certain Acts were brought forward by you, from which a statement was read aloud that about seventy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> condemned C&aelig;cilianus, formerly our Bishop of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, along with his colleagues, and those by whom he was ordained. In the same Acts was given a full account of the case of Felix of Aptunga, as one singularly odious and criminal. When all these had been read, I answered that it was not to be wondered at if the men who then caused that <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and who did not scruple to tamper with Acts, thought that it was right to condemn those against whom they had been instigated by <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, although the sentence was passed without deliberation, in the absence of the parties condemned, and without acquainting them with the matter laid to their charge. I added that we have other <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Acts, according to which Secundus of Tigisis, who was for the time Primate of Numidia, left those who, being there present, confessed themselves traditors to the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and permitted them to remain in the episcopal sees which they then occupied; and I stated that the names of these men are in the list of those who condemned C&aelig;cilianus, and that this Secundus himself was president of the Council in which he secured the condemnation of those who, being absent, were accused as traditors, by the votes of those whom he pardoned when, being present, they confessed the same crime.</p>

<p>4. I then said that some time after the ordination of Majorinus, whom they with impious <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> set up against C&aelig;cilianus, raising one altar against another, and rending with infatuated contentiousness the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, they applied to Constantine, who was then emperor, to appoint <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to act as judges and arbiters concerning the questions which, having arisen in Africa, disturbed the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  This having been done, C&aelig;cilianus and those who had sailed from Africa to accuse him being present, and the case tried by Melchiades, who was then Bishop of Rome, along with the assessors whom at the request of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> the Emperor had sent, nothing could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> against C&aelig;cilianus; and thus, while he was confirmed in his episcopal see, Donatus, who was present as his opponent, was condemned. After all this, when they all still persevered in the obstinacy of their most sinful <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the Emperor being appealed to, took pains to have the matter again more carefully examined and settled at Arles. They, however, declining an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> decision, appealed to Constantine himself to hear their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. When this trial came on, both parties being present, C&aelig;cilianus was pronounced innocent, and they retired vanquished; but they still persisted in the same perversity. At the same time the case of Felix of Aptunga was not forgotten, and he too was acquitted of the crimes laid to his charge, after an investigation by the proconsul at the order of the same prince.</p>

<p>5. Since, however, I was only saying these things, not reading from the record, I seemed to you to be doing less than my earnestness had led you to expect. Perceiving this, I sent at once for that which I had promised to read. While I went on to visit the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Gelizi, intending to return thence to you, all these Acts were brought to you before two days had passed, and were read to you, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, so far as time permitted, in one day. We read first how Secundus of Tigisis did not dare to depose his colleagues in office who confessed themselves to be traditors; but afterwards, by the help of these very men, dared to condemn, without their confessing the crime, and in their absence, C&aelig;cilianus and others who were his colleagues. And we next read the proconsular Acts in which Felix was, after a most thorough investigation, <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> innocent. These, as you will remember, were read in the forenoon. In the afternoon I read to you their petition to Constantine, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> record of the proceedings in Rome of the judges whom he appointed, by which the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> were condemned, and C&aelig;cilianus confirmed in his episcopal dignity. In conclusion, I read the letters of the Emperor Constantine, in which the evidence of all these things was established beyond all possibility of dispute.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>6. What more do you ask, sirs? What more do you ask? The matter in question here is not your gold and silver; it is not your land, nor property, nor bodily health that is at stake. I appeal to your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> concerning their obtaining <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and escaping <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> death. At length awake! I am not handling an obscure question, nor searching into some hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, for the investigation of which capacity is found in no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, or at least in only a few: the thing is clear as day. Is anything more obvious? Could anything be more quickly seen? I affirm that parties innocent and absent were condemned by a Council, very numerous indeed, but hasty in their decisions. I prove this by the proconsular Acts, in which that man was wholly cleared from the charge of being a traditor, whom the Acts of the Council which your party brought forward proclaimed as most specially guilty. I affirm further, that the sentence against those who were said to be traditors was passed by men who had confessed themselves guilty of that very crime. I prove this by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> Acts in which the names of those men are set forth, to whom Secundus of Tigisis, professing a desire to preserve peace, granted pardon of a crime which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them to have committed, and by whose help he afterwards, notwithstanding the destruction of peace, passed sentence upon others of whose crime he had no evidence; whereby he made it manifest that in the former decision he had been moved, not by a regard for peace, but by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> for himself. For Purpurius, Bishop of Limata, had alleged against him that he himself, when he had been put in custody by a curator and his soldiers, in order to compel him to give up the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, was let go, doubtless not without paying a price, in either giving up something, or ordering others to do so for him. He, fearing that this suspicion might be easily enough confirmed, having obtained the advice of Secundus the younger, his own kinsman, and having consulted all his colleagues in the episcopal office, remitted crimes which required no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> to be judged by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and in so doing appeared to be protecting the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: which was false, for he was only protecting himself.</p>

<p>7. For if, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, regard for peace had any place in his heart, he would not afterwards at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> have joined those traditors whom he had left to the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> when they were present, and confessed their fault, in passing sentence for the same crime upon others who were absent, and against whom no one had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> the charge. He was bound, moreover, to be the more afraid on that occasion of disturbing the peace, inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> was a great and famous city, from which any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> originating there might extend, as from the head of the body, throughout all Africa. <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> was also near to the countries beyond the sea, and distinguished by illustrious renown, so that it had a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of more than ordinary influence, who could afford to disregard even a number of enemies conspiring against him, because he saw himself united by letters of communion both to the Roman Church, in which the supremacy of an apostolic chair has always flourished,  and to all other lands from which Africa itself received the gospel, and was prepared to defend himself before these Churches if his adversaries attempted to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> an alienation of them from him. Seeing, therefore, that C&aelig;cilianus declined to come before his colleagues, whom he perceived or suspected (or, as they affirm, pretended to suspect) to be biassed by his enemies against the real merits of his case, it was all the more the duty of Secundus, if he wished to be the guardian of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> peace, to prevent the condemnation in their absence of those who had wholly declined to compear at their bar. For it was not a matter concerning <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of inferior order, but concerning colleagues who might refer their case wholly to the judgment of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, especially of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> churches, in which the sentence passed against them in their absence would have no weight, since they had not deserted their tribunal after having compeared before it, but had always declined compearance because of the suspicions which they entertained.</p>

<p>8. This consideration ought to have weighed much with Secundus, who was at that time Primate, if his desire, as president of the Council, was to promote peace; for he might perhaps have quieted or restrained the mouths of those who were raging against men who were absent, if he had spoken thus: <q>You see, brethren, how after so great havoc of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> peace has been given to us, through God's mercy, by the princes of this world; surely we, being <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, ought not to break up the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> unity which even pagan enemies have ceased to assail. Either, therefore, let us leave to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as Judge, all those cases which the calamity of a most troublous time has brought upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; or if there be some among you who have such certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the guilt of other parties, that they are able to bring against them a definite indictment, and prove it if they plead not guilty, and who also shrink from having communion with such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, let them hasten to our brethren and peers, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the churches beyond the sea, and present to them in the first place a complaint concerning the conduct and contumacy of the accused, as having through consciousness of guilt declined the jurisdiction of their peers in Africa, so that by these foreign <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> they may be summoned to compear and answer before them regarding the things laid to their charge. If they disobey this summons, their criminality and obduracy will become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to those other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; and by a synodical letter sent in their name to all parts of the world throughout which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is now extended, the parties accused will be excluded from communion with all churches, in order to prevent the springing up of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in the see of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>. When that has been done, and these men have been separated from the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we shall without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> ordain another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> over the community in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>; whereas, if now another <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> be ordained by us, communion will most probably be withheld from him by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> beyond the sea, because they will not recognise the validity of the deposition of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, whose ordination was everywhere acknowledged, and with whom letters of communion had been exchanged; and thus, through our undue eagerness to pronounce without deliberation a final sentence, the great scandal of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when it has rest from without, may arise, and we may be found presuming to set up another altar, not against C&aelig;cilianus, but against the universal Church, which, uninformed of our procedure, would still hold communion with him.</q></p>

<p>9. If any one had been disposed to reject sound and equitable counsels such as these, what could he have done? Or how could he have procured the condemnation of any one of his absent peers, when he could not have any decisions with the authority of the Council, seeing that the Primate was opposed to him? And if such a serious revolt against the authority of the Primate himself arose, that some were resolved to condemn at once those whose case he desired to postpone, how much better would it have been for him to separate himself by dissent from such quarrelsome and factious men, than from the communion of the whole world! But because there were no charges which could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> at the bar of foreign <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> against C&aelig;cilianus and those who took part in his ordination, those who condemned them were not willing to delay passing sentence; and when they had pronounced it, were not at any pains to intimate to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> beyond the sea the names of those in Africa with whom, as condemned traditors, she should avoid communion. For if they had attempted this, C&aelig;cilianus and the others would have defended themselves, and would have vindicated their innocence against their false accusers by a most thorough trial before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> beyond the sea.</p>

<p>10. Our belief concerning that perverse and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> Council is, that it was composed chiefly of traditors whom Secundus of Tigisis had pardoned on their confession of guilt; and who, when a rumour had gone abroad that some had been guilty of delivering up the sacred books, sought to turn aside suspicion from themselves by bringing a <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> upon others, and to escape the detection of their crime, through surrounding themselves with a cloud of lying rumours, when men throughout all Africa, believing their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, said what was false concerning innocent men, that they had been condemned at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a> as traditors. Whence you perceive, my beloved friends, how that which some of your party affirmed to be improbable could indeed happen, viz. that the very men who had confessed their own guilt as traditors, and had obtained the remission of their case to the divine tribunal, afterwards took part in judging and condemning others who, not being present to defend themselves, were accused of the same crime. For their own guilt made them more eagerly embrace an opportunity by which they might overwhelm others with a groundless accusation, and by thus finding occupation for the tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which screen their own misdeeds from investigation. Moreover, if it were inconceivable that a man should condemn in another the wrong which he had himself done, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> would not have had occasion to say: <q>Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whosoever you are that judge: for wherein you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you that judge do the same things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111633"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;2:1</a></span> This is exactly what these men did, so that the words of the apostle may be fully and appropriately applied to them.</p>

<p>11. Secundus, therefore, was not acting in the interests of peace and unity when he remitted to the divine tribunal the crimes which these men confessed: for, if so, he would have been much more careful to prevent a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, when there were none present to whom he might be constrained to grant pardon of a crime which they confessed; when, on the contrary, all that the preservation of peace demanded was a refusal to condemn those who were absent. They would have acted <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> to these innocent men, had they even resolved to <em>pardon</em> them, when they were not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> guilty, and had not confessed the guilt, but were actually not present at all. For the guilt of a man is established beyond question when he accepts a pardon. How much more outrageous and blind were they who thought that they had power to condemn for crimes which, as unknown, they could not even have forgiven! In the former case, crimes that were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> were remitted to the divine arbitration, lest others should be inquired into; in the latter case, crimes that were not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> were made ground of condemnation, that those which were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> might be concealed. But it will be said, the crime of C&aelig;cilianus and the others was <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. Even if I were to admit this, the fact of their absence ought to have protected them from such a sentence. For they were not chargeable with deserting a tribunal before which they had never stood; nor was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> so exclusively represented in these African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, that in refusing to appear before them they could be supposed to decline all <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> jurisdiction. For there remained thousands of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in countries beyond the sea, before whom it was manifest that those who seemed to distrust their peers in Africa and Numidia could be tried. Have you forgotten what Scripture commands: <q>Blame no one before you have examined him; and when you have examined him, let your correction be just</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note111634"><a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse7">Sirach&nbsp;11:7</a></span> If, then, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has forbidden us to blame or correct any one before we have questioned him, how much greater is the crime of not merely blaming or correcting, but actually condemning men who, being absent, could not be examined as to the charges brought against them!</p>

<p>12. Moreover, as to the assertion of these judges, that though the parties accused were absent, having not fled from trial, but always avowed their distrust of that faction, and declined to appear before them, the crimes for which they condemned them were well known; I ask, my brethren, how did they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them? You reply, We cannot tell, since the evidence is not stated in the public Acts. But I will tell you how they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> them. Observe carefully the case of Felix of Aptunga, and first read how much more vehement they were against him; for they had just the same grounds for their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in the case of the others as in his, who was afterwards <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> most completely innocent by a thorough and severe investigation. How much greater the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and safety and readiness with which we are warranted in believing the innocence of the others whose indictment was less serious, and their condemnation less severe, seeing that the man against whom they raged much more furiously has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> innocent!</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>13. Some one may perhaps make an objection which, though it was disapproved by you when it was brought forward, I must not pass over, for it has been made by others, viz.: It was not meet that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be acquitted by trial before a proconsul: as if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> had himself procured this trial, and it had not been done by order of the Emperor, to whose care this matter, as one concerning which he was responsible to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, especially belonged. For they themselves had constituted the Emperor the arbiter and judge in this question regarding the surrender of the sacred books, and regarding the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, by their sending petitions to him, and afterwards appealing to him; and nevertheless they refuse to acquiesce in his decision. If, therefore, he is to be blamed whom the magistrate absolved, though he had not himself applied to that tribunal, how much more worthy of blame are those who desired an earthly king to be the judge of their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>! For if it be not wrong to appeal to the Emperor, it is not wrong to be tried by the Emperor, and consequently not wrong to be tried by him to whom the Emperor refers the case. One of your friends was anxious to make out a ground of complaint on the fact that, in the case of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Felix, one <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> was suspended on the rack, and another tortured with pincers.  But was it in the power of Felix to prevent the prosecution of the inquiry with diligence, and even severity, when the case regarding which the advocate was labouring to discover the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was his own? For what else would such a resistance to investigation have been construed to signify, than a confession of his crime? And yet this proconsul, surrounded with the awe-inspiring voices of heralds, and the blood-stained hands of executioners at his service, would not have condemned one of his peers in absence, who declined to come before his tribunal, if there was any other place where his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> could be disposed of. Or if he had in such circumstances pronounced sentence, he would himself assuredly have suffered the due and just award prescribed by civil law.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>14. If, however, you repudiate the Acts of a proconsul, submit yourselves to the Acts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. These have all been read over to you in their order. Perhaps you will say that Melchiades, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman Church, along with the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> beyond the sea who acted as his colleagues, had no right to usurp the place of judge in a matter which had been already settled by seventy African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, over whom the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Tigisis as Primate presided. But what will you say if he in fact did not usurp this place? For the Emperor, being appealed to, sent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to sit with him as judges, with authority to decide the whole matter in the way which seemed to them just. This we prove, both by the petitions of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> and the words of the Emperor himself, both of which were, as you remember, read to you, and are now accessible to be studied or transcribed by you. Read and ponder all these. See with what scrupulous care for the preservation or restoration of peace and unity everything was discussed; how the legal standing of the accusers was inquired into, and what defects were <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in this matter against some of them; and how it was clearly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the testimony of those present that they had nothing to say against C&aelig;cilianus, but wished to transfer the whole matter to the people belonging to the party of Majorinus,  that is, to the seditious multitude who were opposed to the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in order, forsooth, that C&aelig;cilianus might be accused by that crowd which they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be powerful enough to bend aside to their views the minds of the judges by mere turbulent clamour, without any documentary evidence or examination as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; unless it was likely that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> accusations should be brought against C&aelig;cilianus by a multitude infuriated and infatuated by the cup of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, in a place where seventy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had with insane precipitancy condemned, in their absence, men who were their peers, and who were innocent, as was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in the case of Felix of Aptunga. They wished to have C&aelig;cilianus accused by a mob such as that to which they had given way themselves, when they pronounced sentence upon parties who were absent, and who had not been examined. But assuredly they had not come to judges who could be persuaded to such <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>.</p>

<p>15. Your own <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> may enable you to remark here both the obstinacy of these men, and the wisdom of the judges, who to the last persisted in refusing to admit accusations against C&aelig;cilianus from the populace who were of the faction of Majorinus, who had no legal standing in the case. You will also remark how they were required to bring forward the men who had come with them from Africa as accusers or witnesses, or in some other connection with the case, and how it was said that they had been present, but had been withdrawn by Donatus. The said Donatus promised that he would produce them, and this promise he made repeatedly; yet, after all, declined to appear again in presence of that tribunal before which he had already confessed so much, that it seemed as if by his refusal to return he desired only to avoid being present to hear himself condemned; but the things for which he was to be condemned had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> against him in his own presence, and after examination. Besides this, a libel bringing charges against C&aelig;cilianus was handed in by some parties. How the inquiry was thereupon opened anew, what <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> brought up the libel, and how nothing after all could be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> against C&aelig;cilianus, I need not state, seeing that you have heard it all, and can read it as often as you please.</p>

<p>16. As to the fact that there were seventy <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in the Council [which condemned C&aelig;cilianus], you remember what was said in the way of pleading against him the venerable authority of so great a number. Nevertheless these most venerable men resolved to keep their judgment unembarrassed by endless questions of hopeless intricacy, and did not care to inquire either what was the number of those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or whence they had been collected, when they saw them to be blinded with such reckless presumption as to pronounce rash sentence upon their peers in their absence, and without having examined them. And yet what a decision was finally pronounced by the blessed Melchiades himself; how equitable, how complete, how <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a>, and how fitted to make peace! For he did not presume to depose from his own rank those peers against whom nothing had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>; and, laying blame chiefly upon Donatus, whom he had found the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the whole disturbance, he gave to all the others restoration if they chose to accept it, and was prepared to send letters of communion even to those who were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been ordained by Majorinus; so that wherever there were two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, through this dissension doubling their number, he decided that the one who was prior in the date of ordination should be confirmed in his see, and a new congregation found for the other. O excellent man! O son of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peace, father of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people! Compare now this handful, with that multitude of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, not counting, but weighing them: on the one side you have moderation and circumspection; on the other, precipitancy and blindness. On the one side, clemency has not wronged <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nor has <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> been at variance with clemency; on the other side, <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> was hiding itself under passion, and passion was goaded to excess by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. In the one case, they assembled to clear the innocent from false accusations by discovering where the guilt really lay; in the other, they had met to screen the guilty from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> accusations by bringing false charges against the innocent.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>17. Could C&aelig;cilianus leave himself to be tried and judged by these men, when he had such others before whom, if his case were argued, he could most easily prove his innocence? He could not have left himself in their hands even had he been a stranger recently ordained over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, and consequently not aware of the power in perverting the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, either worthless or unwise, which was then possessed by a certain Lucilla, a very <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whom he had offended when he was a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, by rebuking her in the exercise of church discipline; for this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> influence was also at work to bring about that iniquitous transaction. For in that Council, in which men absent and innocent were condemned by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had confessed themselves to be traditors, there were a few who wished, by defaming others, to hide their own crimes, that men, led astray by unfounded rumours, might be turned aside from inquiring into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The number of those who were especially interested in this was not great, although the preponderating authority was on their side; because they had with them Secundus himself, who, yielding to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, had pardoned them. But the rest are said to have been <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a> and instigated specially against C&aelig;cilianus by the money of Lucilla. There are Acts in the possession of Zenophilus, a man of consular rank, according to which one Nundinarius, a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> who had been (as we learn from the same Acts) deposed by Sylvanus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Cirta, having failed in an attempt to recommend himself to that party by the letters of other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, in the heat of passion revealed many secrets, and brought them forward in open court; among which we read this on the record, that the rearing of rival altars in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, the chief city of Africa, was due to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> being <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a> by the money of Lucilla. I am aware that I did not read these Acts to you, but you remember that there was not time. Besides these influences, there was also some bitterness arising from mortified <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, because they had not themselves ordained C&aelig;cilianus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>.</p>

<p>18. When C&aelig;cilianus <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that these men had assembled, not as impartial judges, but hostile and perverted through all these things, was it possible that either he should consent, or the people over whom he presided should allow him, to leave the church and go into a private dwelling, where he was not to be tried fairly by his peers, but to be slain by a small faction, urged on by a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> spite, especially when he saw that his case might have an unbiassed and equitable hearing before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> beyond the sea, which was uninfluenced by private enmities on either side in the dispute? If his adversaries declined pleading before that tribunal, they would thereby cut themselves off from that communion with the whole world which innocence enjoys. And if they attempted there to bring a charge against him, then he would compear for himself, and defend his innocence against all their plots, as you have learned that he afterwards did, when they, already guilty of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and stained with the atrocious crime of having actually reared their rival altar, applied&mdash; but too late&mdash; for the decision of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> beyond the sea. For this they would have done at first, if their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> had been supported by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but their policy was to come to the trial after false rumours had gained strength by lapse of time, and public report of old standing, so to speak, had prejudged the case; or, which seems more likely, having first condemned C&aelig;cilianus as they pleased, they relied for safety upon their number, and did not dare to open the discussion of so bad a case before other judges, by whom, as they were not influenced by <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribery</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might be discovered.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>19. But when they actually found that the communion of the whole world with C&aelig;cilianus continued as before, and that letters of communion from churches beyond the sea were sent to him, and not to the man whom they had flagitiously ordained, they became ashamed of being always silent; for it might be objected to them: Why did they suffer the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in so many countries to go on in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, communicating with men that were condemned; and especially why did they cut themselves off from communion with the whole world, against which they had no charge to make, by their bearing in silence the exclusion from that communion of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom they had ordained in <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>? They chose, therefore, as it is reported, to bring their dispute with C&aelig;cilianus before the foreign churches, in order to secure one of two things, either of which they were prepared to accept: if, on the one hand, by any amount of craft, they succeeded in making good the false accusation, they would abundantly satisfy their <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of revenge; if, however, they failed, they might remain as stubborn as before, but would now have, as it were, some excuse for it, in alleging that they had suffered at the hands of an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> tribunal&mdash;the common outcry of all worthless litigants, though they have been defeated by the clearest light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>&mdash;as if it might not have been said, and most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> said, to them: <q>Well, let us suppose that those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who decided the case at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> were not good judges; there still remained a plenary Council of the universal Church, in which these judges themselves might be put on their defence; so that, if they were convicted of mistake, their decisions might be reversed.</q> Whether they have done this or not, let them prove: for we easily prove that it was not done, by the fact that the whole world does not communicate with them; or if it was done, they were defeated there also, of which their state of separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>.</p>

<p>20. What they actually did afterwards, however, is sufficiently shown in the letter of the Emperor. For it was not before other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, but at the bar of the Emperor, that they dared to bring the charge of wrong judgment against <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> judges of so high authority as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by whose sentence the innocence of C&aelig;cilianus and their own guilt had been declared. He granted them the second trial at Aries, before other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; not because this was due to them, but only as a concession to their stubbornness, and from a desire by all means to restrain so great effrontery. For this <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Emperor did not presume so to grant their unruly and groundless complaints as to make himself the judge of the decision pronounced by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had sat at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; but he appointed, as I have said, other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, from whom, however, they preferred again to appeal to the Emperor himself; and you have heard the terms in which he disapproved of this. Would that even then they had desisted from their most insane contentions, and had yielded at last to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as he yielded to them when (intending afterwards to apologize for this course to the reverend prelates) he consented to try their case after the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, on condition that, if they did not submit to his decision, for which they had themselves appealed, they should thenceforward be silent! For he ordered that both parties should meet him at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to argue the case. When C&aelig;cilianus, for some reason, failed to compear there, he, at their request, ordered all to follow him to Milan. Then some of their party began to withdraw, perhaps offended that Constantine did not follow their example, and condemn C&aelig;cilianus in his absence at once and summarily. When the <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> Emperor was aware of this, he compelled the rest to come to Milan in charge of his guards. C&aelig;cilianus having come there, he brought him forward in person, as he has written; and having examined the matter with the diligence, caution, and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> which his letters on the subject indicate, he pronounced C&aelig;cilianus perfectly innocent, and them most criminal.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>21. And to this day they administer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> outside of the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and, if they can, they rebaptize the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: they offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> in discord and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and salute in the name of peace communities which they pronounce beyond the bounds of the peace of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. The unity of Christ is rent asunder, the heritage of Christ is reproached, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ is treated with contempt; and they refuse to have these <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> corrected by constituted <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authorities, applying penalties of a temporal kind in order to prevent them from being doomed to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment for such sacrilege. We blame them for the rage which has driven them to <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> which makes them rebaptize, and for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of separation from the heritage of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which has been spread abroad through all lands. In using manuscripts which are in their hands as well as in ours, we mention churches, the names of which are now read by them also, but with which they have now no communion; and when these are pronounced in their conventicles, they say to the reader, <q>Peace be with you;</q> and yet they have no peace with those to whom these letters were written. They, on the other hand, blame us for crimes of men now dead, making charges which either are false, or, if <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, do not concern us; not perceiving that in the things which we lay to their charge they are all involved, but in the things which they lay to our charge the blame is due to the chaff or the tares in the Lord's harvest, and the crime does not belong to the good grain; not considering, moreover, that within our unity those only have fellowship with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> who take pleasure in their being such, whereas those who are displeased with their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> yet cannot correct them&mdash;as they do not presume to root out the tares before the harvest, lest they root out the wheat also, <span class="stiki" id="note111637"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;13:29</a></span> &mdash; have fellowship with them, not in their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but in the altar of Christ; so that not only do they avoid being defiled by them, but they deserve commendation and praise according to the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because, in order to prevent the name of Christ from being reproached by odious schisms, they tolerate in the interest of unity that which in the interest of righteousness they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>.</p>

<p>22. If they have ears, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. For in the Apocalypse of John we read: <q>Unto the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Ephesus write: These things says He that holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks; I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your works, and your labour, and your patience, and how you can not bear them which are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: and you have tried them which say they are <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and are not, and hast found them liars: and hast borne, and hast patience, and for My name's sake hast tolerated them,  and hast not fainted.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111639"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse1">Revelation&nbsp;2:1-3</a></span> Now, if He wished this to be understood as addressed to a celestial <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and not to those invested with authority in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, He would not go on to say: <q>Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Remember therefore from whence you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of his place, unless you repent.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111640"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;2:4-5</a></span> This could not be said to the heavenly <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, who retain their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unchanged, as the only beings of their order that have departed and fallen from their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> are the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The first <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> here alluded to is that which was <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in their tolerating for Christ's name's sake the false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. To this He commands them to return, and to do <q>their first works.</q> Now we are reproached with the crimes of bad men, not done by us, but by others; and some of them, moreover, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us. Nevertheless, even if they were actually committed, and that under our own eyes, and we bore with them for the sake of unity, letting the tares alone on account of the wheat, whosoever with open heart receives the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> would pronounce us not only free from blame, but worthy of no small praise.</p>

<p>23. <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> bears with the multitude demanding, fashioning, and worshipping an idol. <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> bears with thousands murmuring against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so often offending His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> name. David bears with Saul his persecutor, even when forsaking the things that are above by his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life, and following after the things that are beneath by magical arts, avenges his death, and calls him the Lord's anointed,  because of the venerable right by which he had been <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>. Samuel bears with the reprobate sons of Eli, and his own perverse sons, whom the people refused to tolerate, and were therefore rebuked by the warning and punished by the severity of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Lastly, he bears with the nation itself, though <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> and despising God. Isaiah bears with those against whom he hurls so many merited denunciations. Jeremiah bears with those at whose hands he suffers so many things. Zechariah bears with the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, as to whose character in those days Scripture informs us. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have omitted many examples: let those who are willing and able read the divine records for themselves: they will find that all the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> servants and friends of God have always had to bear with some among their own people, with whom, nevertheless, they partook in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of that dispensation, and in so doing not only were not defiled by them, but were to be commended for their tolerant spirit, <q>endeavouring to keep,</q> as the apostle says, <q>the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111642"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> Let them also observe what has occurred since the Lord's coming, in which time we would find many more examples of this toleration in all parts of the world, if they could all be written down and authenticated: but attend to those which are on record. The Lord Himself bears with Judas, a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, a thief, His own betrayer; He permits him, along with the innocent <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, to receive that which <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as our ransom.  The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> bear with false <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and in the midst of men who sought their own things, and not the things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, not seeking his own, but the things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, lives in the practice of a most noble toleration. In fine, as I mentioned a little while ago, the person presiding under the title of Angel over a Church, is commended, because, though he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> those that were <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he yet bore with them for the Lord's name's sake, even when they were tried and discovered.</p>

<p>24. In conclusion, let them ask themselves: Do they not bear with the murders and devastations by fire which are perpetrated by the Circumcelliones, who treat with <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> the dead bodies of those who cast themselves down from dangerous heights? Do they not bear with the misery which has made all Africa groan for years beneath the incredible outrages of one man, Optatus [<a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Thamugada]? I forbear from specifying the tyrannical acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and public depredations in districts, towns, and properties throughout Africa; for it is better to leave you to speak of these to each other, whether in whispers or openly, as you please. For wherever you turn your eyes, you will find the things of which I speak, or, more correctly, refrain from speaking. Nor do we on this ground accuse those whom, when they do such things, you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. What we dislike in that party is not their bearing with those who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, but their intolerable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the matter of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, of raising altar against altar, and of separation from the heritage of Christ now spread, as was so long ago promised, throughout the world. We behold with grief and lamentation peace broken, unity rent asunder, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> administered a second time, and contempt poured on the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> even when ministered and received by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. If they regard these things as trifles, let them observe those examples by which it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> how they are esteemed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The men who made an idol perished by a common death, being slain with the sword: <span class="stiki" id="note111644"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse27">Exodus&nbsp;32:27-28</a></span> but when the men endeavoured to make a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, the leaders were swallowed up by the opening earth, and the crowd of their accomplices was consumed by fire.  In the difference between the punishments, the different degrees of demerit may be discerned.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>25. These, then, are the facts: In time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, the sacred books are surrendered to the persecutors. Those who were guilty of this surrender confess it, and are remitted to the divine tribunal; those who were innocent are not examined, but condemned at once by rash men. The integrity of that one who, of all the men thus condemned in their absence, was the most vehemently accused, is afterwards vindicated before unimpeachable judges. From the decision of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> an appeal is made to the Emperor; the Emperor is chosen judge; and the sentence of the Emperor, when pronounced, is set at naught. What was then done you have read; what is now being done you have before your eyes. If, after all that you have read, you are still in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, be convinced by what you see. By all means let us give up arguing from ancient manuscripts, public archives, or the acts of courts, civil or <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a>. We have a greater book&mdash; the world itself. In it I read the accomplishment of that of which I read the promise in the Book of God: <q>The Lord has said unto me, You are my Son, this day have I begotten You: ask of Me, and I shall give You the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> for Your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession.</q>  He that has not communion with this inheritance may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> himself to be disinherited, whatever books he may plead to the contrary. He that assails this inheritance is plainly enough declared to be an outcast from the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The question is raised as to the parties guilty of surrendering the divine books in which that inheritance is promised. Let him be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have delivered the testament to the flames, who is resisting the intentions of the testator. O faction of Donatus, what has the Corinthian Church done against you? In speaking of this one Church, I wish to be understood as asking the same question in regard to all similar churches remote from you. What have these churches done against you, which could not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even what you had done, or the names of the men whom you branded with condemnation? Or is it so, that because C&aelig;cilianus gave offense to Lucilla in Africa, the light of Christ is lost to the whole world? </p> 

<p>26. Let them at last become sensible of what they have done; for in the lapse of years, by a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> retribution, their work has recoiled upon themselves. Ask by what <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> instigation Maximianus  (said to be a kinsman of Donatus) withdrew himself from the communion of Primianus, and how, having gathered a faction of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, he pronounced sentence against Primianus in his absence, and had himself ordained as a rival <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in his place&mdash;precisely as Majorinus, under the influence of Lucilla, assembled a faction of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and, having condemned C&aelig;cilianus in his absence, was ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in opposition to him. Do you admit, as I suppose you do, that when Primianus was delivered by the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his communion in Africa from the sentence pronounced by the faction of Maximianus, this decision was valid and sufficient? And will you refuse to admit the same in the case of C&aelig;cilianus, when he was released by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the same one Church beyond the sea from the sentence pronounced by the faction of Majorinus? Pray, my brethren, what great thing do I ask of you? What difficulty is there in comprehending what I bring before you? The African Church, if it be compared with the churches in other parts of the world, is very different from them, and is left far behind both in numbers and in influence; and even if it had retained its unity, is far smaller when compared with the universal Church in other nations, than was the faction of Maximianus when compared with that of Primianus. I ask, however, only this&mdash; and I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it to be just&mdash; that you give no more weight to the Council of Secundus of Tigisis, which Lucilla stirred up against C&aelig;cilianus when absent, and against an apostolic see and the whole world in communion with C&aelig;cilianus, than you give to the Council of Maximianus, which in like manner some other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> stirred up against Primianus when absent, and against the rest of the multitude throughout Africa which was in communion with him. What case could be more transparent? What demand more just?</p>

<p>27. You see and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> all these things, and you groan over them; and yet God at the same time sees that nothing compels you to remain in such fatal and impious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, if you would but subdue the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh in order to win the spiritual kingdom; and in order to escape from <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> punishment, have <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to forfeit the friendship of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, whose favour will not avail at the bar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Go now, and take counsel together: find what you can say in reply to that which I have written. If you bring forward manuscripts on your side, we do the same; if your party say that our documents are not to be trusted, let them not take it amiss if we retort the charge. No one can erase from heaven the divine decree, no one can efface from earth the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. His decree has promised the whole world, and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has filled it; and it includes both bad and good. On earth it loses none but the bad, and into heaven it admits none but the good.</p>

<p>In writing this discourse, God is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> with what sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to peace and to you I have taken and used that which He has given. It shall be to you a means of correction if you be willing, and a testimony against you whether you will or not.</p>
