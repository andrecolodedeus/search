<h1>Letter 44</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em> To a lapsed Monk</em>. </p>

<p>1. I do not wish you <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, for there is no <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Even now I cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it; my heart cannot conceive iniquity so great as the crime which you have committed; if, that is, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> really is what is generally understood. I am at a loss to think how wisdom so deep can have been made to disappear; how such exact discipline can have been undone; whence blindness so profound can have been shed round you; how with utter inconsiderateness you have wrought such destruction of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. If this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, you have given over your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to the pit, and have slackened the earnestness of all who have heard of your impiety. You have set at nought the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; you have missed the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> fight. I grieve over you. What <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">cleric</a>  does not lament as he hears? What ecclesiastic does not beat the breast? What <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a> is not downcast? What <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> is not sad? Haply, even the sun has grown dark at your fall, and the powers of heaven have been shaken at your destruction. Even senseless stones have shed tears at your <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>; even your enemies have wept at the greatness of your iniquity. Oh hardness of heart! Oh cruelty! You did not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; you did not reverence men; you cared nothing for your friends; you made shipwreck of all at once; at once you were stripped of all. Once more I grieve over you, unhappy man. You were proclaiming to all the power of the kingdom, and you fell from it. You were making all stand in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of your teaching, and there was no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God before your eyes. You were preaching purity, and you are found polluted. You were priding yourself on your poverty, and you are convicted of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>; you were demonstrating and explaining the chastisement of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and you yourself brought chastisement on your own head. How am I to lament you, how grieve for you? How is Lucifer that was rising in the morning fallen and dashed on the ground? Both the ears of every hearer will tingle. How is the Nazarite, brighter than gold, become dark above pitch? How has the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> son of Sion become an unprofitable vessel! Of him, whose memory of the sacred Scriptures was in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> mouths, the memory today has perished with the sound. The man of quick intelligence has quickly perished. The man of manifold wit has wrought manifold iniquity. All who profited by your teaching have been injured by your fall. All who came to listen to your conversation have stopped their ears at your fall. I, sorrowful and downcast, weakened in every way, eating ashes for bread and with sackcloth on my wound, am thus recounting your praises; or rather, with none to comfort and none to cure, am making an inscription for a tomb. For comfort is hid from my eyes. I have no salve, no oil, no bandage to put on. My wound is sore, how shall I be healed?</p>

<p>2. If you have any hope of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; if you have the least thought of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or any desire for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come; if you have any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the chastisements reserved for the impenitent, awake without delay, lift up your eyes to heaven, come to your senses, cease from your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, shake off the stupor that enwraps you, make a stand against the foe who has struck you down. Make an effort to rise from the ground. Remember the good Shepherd who will follow and rescue you. Though it be but two legs or a lobe of an ear,  spring back from the beast that has wounded you. Remember the mercies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and how He cures with oil and wine. Do not despair of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Recall your recollection of how it is written in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that he who is falling rises and he who turns away returns;  the wounded is healed, the prey of beasts escapes; he who owns his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not rejected. The Lord wills not the death of a sinner but rather that he should turn and live.  Do not despise, like the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in the pit of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.  There is a time of endurance, a time of long suffering, a time of healing, a time of correction. Have you stumbled? Arise. Have you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? Cease. Do not stand in the way of sinners,  but spring away. When you are converted and groan you shall be saved. Out of labour comes health, out of sweat <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Beware lest, from your wish to keep certain <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>, you break the <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to God which you professed before many witnesses.  Pray do not hesitate to come to me for any earthly considerations. When I have recovered my dead I shall lament, I shall tend him, I will weep <q>because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322101"><a href="../bible/isa022.htm#verse4">Isaiah&nbsp;22:4</a></span> All are ready to welcome you, all will share your efforts. Do not sink back. Remember the days of old. There is <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; there is amendment. Be of good cheer; do not despair. It is not a law condemning to death without pity, but mercy remitting punishment and awaiting improvement. The doors are not yet shut; the bridegroom hears; <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is not the master. Make another effort, do not hesitate, have pity on yourself and on all of us in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, to Whom be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might now and for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
