<h1>Letter 44</h1>

<p>Leo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod which is assembled at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to Theodosius Augustus.</p>

<h2>I. He exposes the unscrupulous nature of the proceedings at Ephesus.</h2>

<p>From your clemency's letter, which in your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith you sent sometime ago to the see of the blessed Apostle Peter, we drew such confidence in your defence of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and peace that we thought nothing harmful could happen in so plain and well-ordered a matter; especially when those who were sent to the episcopal council, which you ordered to be held at Ephesus, were so fully instructed that, if the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria had allowed the letters, which they brought either to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod or to Flavian the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to be read in the ears of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, by the declaration of the most pure Faith, which being Divinely inspired we both have received and hold, all noise of disputings would have been so completely hushed that neither <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> could any longer disport itself, nor jealousy find occasion to do mischief. But because private interests are consulted under cover of religion, the disloyalty of a few has wrought that which must wound the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For not from some untrustworthy messenger, but from a most faithful narrator of the things which have been done, Hilary, our <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, who, lest he should be compelled by force to subscribe to their proceedings, with great difficulty made his escape, we have learned that a great many <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> came together at the synod, whose numbers would doubtless have assisted the debate and decision, if he who claimed for himself the chief place had consented to maintain <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> moderation, in order that, according to custom, when all had freely expressed their opinion, after quiet and fair deliberation, that might be ordained which was both agreeable to the Faith and helpful to those in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But we have been told that all who had come were not present at the actual decision: for we have learned that some were rejected while others were admitted, who at the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> requisition surrendered themselves to an unrighteous subscription, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> they would suffer harm unless they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> his commands, and that such a resolution was brought forward by him that in attacking one man he might wreak his fury of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Which our delegates from the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> saw to be so <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> and opposed to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith that no pressure could force them to assent; for in the same synod they stoutly protested, as they ought, that the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> would never receive what was being passed: since the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Faith is absolutely destroyed (which <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> forfend in your Grace's reign), unless this abominable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, which exceeds all former <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>, be abolished.</p>

<h2>II. And entreats the Emperor to help in reversing their decision.</h2>

<p>But because the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> subtlety deceives the unwary, and so mocks the imprudence of some by a show of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> as to persuade them to things harmful instead of profitable, we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> your Grace, renounce all complicity in this endangering of religion and Faith, and afford in the treatment of Divine things that which is granted in worldly matters by the equity of your <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> presumption may not do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to Christ's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Behold, I, O most <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and honoured Emperor, with my fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  fulfilling towards your revered clemency the offices of sincere <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and desiring you in all things to please <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to whom <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> are offered for you by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest before the Lord Christ's tribunal we be judged guilty for our silence,&mdash; we beseech you in the presence of the Undivided Trinity of the One Godhead, Whom such an act wrongs (for He is Himself the Guardian and the Author of your empire), and in the presence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, order everything to be in the position in which they were before the decision until a larger number of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> be assembled from the whole world. Suffer not yourself to be weighted with another's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because (and we must say it) we are afraid lest He, Whose religion is being destroyed, be provoked to <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>. Keep before your eyes, and with all your mental vision gaze reverently upon the blessed Peter's <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and the crowns which all the Apostles have in common with him and the palms of all the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who had no other reason for suffering than the confession of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Godhead and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Manhood in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>III. He asks for a Council in Italy.</h2>

<p>And because this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is now being impiously opposed by a few <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, all the churches of our parts, and all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> entreat your clemency, with groans and tears seeing that our delegates faithfully protested, and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Flavian gave them an appeal in writing, to order a general synod to be held in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, which shall either dismiss or appease all disputes in such a way that there be nothing any longer either doubtful in the Faith or divided in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and to it, of course, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the Eastern provinces must come, and if any of them were overcome by threats and injury, and deviated from the path of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they may be fully restored by health-giving measures, and they themselves, whose case is harder, if they acquiesce in wiser counsels, may not fall from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And how necessary this request is after the lodging of an appeal is witnessed by the canonical decrees passed at Nic&aelig;a by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the whole world, which are added below.  Show favour to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> after your own and your <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> custom. Give us such liberty to defend the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith as no <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the world, while your revered clemency is safe, shall be able to take away. For it is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not only of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> but of your Kingdom and prosperity that we plead, that you may enjoy the peaceful sway of your provinces. Defend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in unshaken peace against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that your empire also may be defended by Christ's right hand. Dated the 13th of October, in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>
