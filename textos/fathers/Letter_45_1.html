<h1>Letter 45</h1>

<p><strong>To Asella</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">After leaving Rome for the East, Jerome writes to Asella to refute the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> by which he had been assailed, especially as regards his intimacy with <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> and <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>. Written on board ship at Ostia, in August, 385 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. Were I to think myself able to requite your kindness I should be foolish. God is able in my stead to reward a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to Him. So unworthy, indeed, am I of your regard that I have never ventured to estimate its value or even to wish that it might be given me for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake. Some consider me a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man, laden with iniquity; and such language is more than justified by my actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Yet in dealing with the bad you do well to account them good. It is dangerous to judge another man's servant; <span class="stiki" id="note300920"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;14:4</a></span> and to speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the righteous is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not easily pardoned. The day will surely come when you and I shall mourn for others; for not a few will be in the flames.</p>

<p>2. I am said to be an <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> turncoat, a slippery knave, one who lies and deceives others by Satanic arts. Which is the safer course, I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, to invent or credit these charges against innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, or to refuse to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> them, even of the guilty? Some kissed my hands, yet attacked me with the tongues of vipers; sympathy was on their lips, but malignant <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in their hearts. The Lord saw them and had them in derision,  reserving my poor self and them for judgment to come. One would attack my gait or my way of laughing; another would find something amiss in my looks; another would suspect the simplicity of my manner. Such is the company in which I have lived for almost three years.</p>

<p>It often happened that I found myself surrounded with <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and to some of these I expounded the divine books as best I could. Our studies brought about constant intercourse, this soon ripened into intimacy, and this, in turn, produced mutual confidence. If they have ever seen anything in my conduct unbecoming a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> let them say so. Have I taken any one's money? Have I not disdained all gifts, whether small or great? Has the chink of any one's coin been heard in my hand? <span class="stiki" id="note300922"><a href="../bible/1sa012.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12:3</a></span> Has my language been equivocal, or my eye wanton? No; my sex is my one crime, and even on this score I am not assailed, save when there is a talk of <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> going to Jerusalem. Very well, then. They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> my accuser when he lied; why do they not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> him when he retracts? He is the same man now that he was then, and yet he who before declared me guilty now confesses that I am innocent. Surely a man's words under torture are more trustworthy than in moments of gayety, except, indeed, that people are prone to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> falsehoods designed to gratify their ears, or, worse still, stories which, till then uninvented, they have urged others to invent.</p>

<p>3. Before I became acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> of the saintly <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, all Rome resounded with my praises. Almost every one concurred in judging me worthy of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>. Damasus, of blessed memory, spoke no words but mine.  Men called me <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, eloquent.</p>

<p>Did I ever cross the threshold of a light <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? Was I ever fascinated by silk dresses, or glowing gems, or rouged faces, or display of gold? Of all the ladies in Rome but one had power to subdue me, and that one was <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>. She mourned and fasted, she was squalid with dirt, her eyes were dim from weeping. For whole nights she would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the Lord for mercy, and often the rising sun found her still at her <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. The psalms were her only songs, the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> her whole speech, continence her one indulgence, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> the staple of her life. The only <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who took my fancy was one whom I had not so much as seen at table. But when I began to revere, respect, and venerate her as her conspicuous <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> deserved, all my former <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> forsook me on the spot.</p>

<p>4. Oh! <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, that dost begin by tearing yourself! Oh! cunning malignity of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, that dost always <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> things <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>! Of all the ladies in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, the only ones that caused scandal were <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> and Melanium, who, despising their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and deserting their children, uplifted the cross of the Lord as a standard of religion. Had they frequented the baths, or chosen to use perfumes, or taken advantage of their <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and position as <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> to enjoy life and to be independent, they would have been saluted as ladies of high rank and saintliness. As it is, of course, it is in order to appear beautiful that they put on sackcloth and ashes, and they endure <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and filth merely to go down into the Gehenna of fire! As if they could not perish with the crowd whom the mob applauds!  If it were <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> or <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who thus assailed their mode of life, they would at least have the consolation of failing to please only those whom Christ Himself has failed to please. But, shameful to say, it is <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who thus neglect the care of their own households, and, disregarding the beams in their own eyes, look for motes in those of their neighbors. <span class="stiki" id="note300925"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;7:3</a></span> They pull to pieces every profession of religion, and think that they have found a remedy for their own doom, if they can disprove the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of others, if they can detract from every one, if they can show that those who perish are many, and sinners, a great multitude.</p>

<p>5. You bathe daily; another regards such over-niceness as defilement. You surfeit yourself on wild fowl and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> yourself on eating sturgeon; I, on the contrary, fill my belly with beans. You find pleasure in troops of laughing girls; I prefer <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> and Melanium who weep. You <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a> what belongs to others; they disdain what is their own. You like wines flavored with honey; they drink cold water, more delicious still. You count as lost what you cannot have, eat up, and devour on the moment; they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and look for <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things to come. And if they are wrong, and if the resurrection of the body on which they rely is a foolish delusion, what does it matter to you? We, on our side, look with disfavor on such a life as yours. You can fatten yourself on your <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things as much as you please; I for my part prefer paleness and emaciation. You suppose that men like me are unhappy; we regard you as more unhappy still. Thus we reciprocate each other's thoughts, and appear to each other mutually insane.</p>

<p>6. I write this in haste, dear Lady Asella, as I go on board, overwhelmed with grief and tears; yet I thank my God that I am counted worthy of the world's <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note300926"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse18">John&nbsp;15:18</a></span> Pray for me that, after <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, I may see Jerusalem once more; that Joshua, the son of Josedech, may have dominion over me, <span class="stiki" id="note300927"><a href="../bible/hag001.htm#verse1">Haggai&nbsp;1:1</a></span> and not <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a>, that Ezra, whose name means helper, may come and restore me to my own country. I was a fool in wishing to sing the Lord's song in a strange land,  and in leaving Mount Sinai, to seek the help of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. I forgot that the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> warns us <span class="stiki" id="note300929"><a href="../bible/luk010.htm#verse30">Luke&nbsp;10:30-35</a></span> that he who goes down from Jerusalem immediately falls among <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, is spoiled, is wounded, is left for dead. But, although <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and Levite may disregard me, there is still the good <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> who, when men said to him, <q>You are a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a> and hast a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300930"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;8:48</a></span> disclaimed having a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but did not disclaim being a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300931"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse49">John&nbsp;8:49</a></span> this being the Hebrew equivalent for our word guardian. Men call me a mischief-maker, and I take the title as a recognition of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For I am but a servant, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> still call my master a magician. The apostle,  likewise, is spoken of as a deceiver. There has no <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> taken me but such as is common to man. <span class="stiki" id="note300933"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:13</a></span> How few distresses have I endured, I who am yet a soldier of the cross! Men have laid to my charge a crime of which I am not guilty;  but I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I must enter the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> report as well as through good. <span class="stiki" id="note300935"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:8</a></span> </p>

<p>7. Salute <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> and <a href="../cathen/05629a.htm">Eustochium</a>, who, whatever the world may think, are always mine in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Salute Albina, your mother, and Marcella, your sister; Marcellina also, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Felicitas; and say to them all: <q>We must all stand before the judgment seat of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note300936"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;14:10</a></span> and there shall be revealed the principle by which each has lived.</q></p>

<p>And now, illustrious model of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>, remember me, I beseech you, in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and by your intercessions calm the waves of the sea.</p>
