<h1>Letter 45</h1>

<p>Leo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod which is assembled in the City of Rome to Pulcheria Augusta.</p>

<h2>I. He sends a copy of the former letter which failed to reach her.</h2>

<p>If the letters respecting the Faith which were dispatched to your Grace by the hands of our <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> had reached you, it is certain you would have been able, the Lord helping you, to provide a remedy for these things which have been done against the Faith. For when have you failed either the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> or the religion or the Faith of Christ? But when those who were sent were so completely hindered from reaching your clemency that only one of them, namely Hilary our <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, with difficulty fled and returned, we thought it necessary to rewrite our letter: and that our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> may deserve to receive more weight, we have subjoined a copy of the very document which did not reach your clemency, entreating you even more earnestly than before to take under protection that religion in which you excel which will win you the greater <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in proportion to the heinousness of the crimes against which your royal <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> requires you to proceed, lest the integrity of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Faith be violated by any plot of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> devising. For the things which were <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to require setting at rest and healing by the meeting of a Synod at Ephesus, have not only resulted in still greater disturbances of peace but, which is the more to be regretted, even in the overthrow of the very Faith whereby we are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</p>

<h2>II. He also sends a copy of his letter to the Emperor and explains its contents</h2>

<p>And they indeed, who were sent, and one of whom, escaping the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria who claims everything for himself, faithfully reported to us what took place in the Synod, opposed, as it became them, what I will call the frenzy not the judgment of one man, protesting that those things which were being carried through by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> could not reverse the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the Creed itself composed by the Apostles, and that no injuries could sever them from that Faith which they had brought fully set forth and expounded from the See of the blessed Apostle Peter to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod. And since this statement was not allowed to be read out at the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> request, in order forsooth that by the rejection of that Faith which has crowned patriarchs, <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, the birth according to the flesh of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord and the confession of His <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Death and Resurrection (we shudder to say it) might be overthrown, we have written  on this matter according to our ability, to our most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and (what is far greater) our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Prince, and at the same time have subjoined a copy of the letter to you to the end that he may not allow the Faith, in which he was re-born and reigns through God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to be corrupted by any innovation, since Bishop Flavian continues in communion with us all, and that which has been done without regard to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and contrary to all the teaching of the canons can, under no consideration, be held valid. And because the Synod of Ephesus has not removed but increased the scandal of disagreement (I have asked him) to appoint a place and time for holding a council within <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, all quarrels and prejudices on both sides being suspended, that everything which has engendered offense may be the more diligently reconsidered and without wounding the Faith, without injuring religion those <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> may return into the peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who through irresolution were forced to subscribe, and only their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> be removed.</p>

<h2>III. He asks her to assist his petition with the Emperor.</h2>

<p>And that we may be worthy to obtain this, let your well-tried <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and protection, which has always helped the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in her labours, deign to advance our petition with our most clement Prince, under a special commission so to act from the blessed Apostle Peter; so that before this civil and destructive <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> gains strength within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he may grant opportunity of restoring unity by God's aid, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that the strength of his empire will be increased by every extension of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> freedom that his kindly will affects.</p>

<p>Dated 13th of October in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes (449).</p>
