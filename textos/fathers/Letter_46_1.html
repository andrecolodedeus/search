<h1>Letter 46</h1>

<p> <em>Letter  to the Mareotis from Sardica</em>, a.d . 343-4.</p>

<p>Athanasius to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and the people of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the Mareotis, brethren beloved and longed for, greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council has praised your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. They have all acknowledged your spirit and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in all things, in that you did not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> threats, and though you had to bear insults and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> against your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> you held out. Your letters when read out to all produced tears and enlisted universal sympathy. They loved you though absent, and reckoned your <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> as their own. Their letter to you is a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their affection: and although it would suffice to include you along with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a> , yet the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod has written separately to you in order that you may be encouraged not to give way on account of your sufferings, but to give thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because your patience shall have good fruit.</p>

<p>Formerly the character of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> was not evident. But now it is revealed and laid open to all. For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synod has taken cognisance of the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> these men have concocted against you, and has had them in abhorrence, and has deposed Theodore, Valens, Ursacius, in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a>  and the Mareotis by consent of all. The same notice has been given to other Churches also. And since the cruelty and tyranny practised by them against the Churches can no longer be borne, they have been cast out from the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> and expelled from the communion of all. Moreover of Gregory they were unwilling even to make mention, for since the man has lacked the very name of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, they thought it superfluous to name him. But on account of those who are deceived by him they have mentioned his name; not because he seemed worthy of mention, but that those deceived by him might thereby recognise his <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> and blush at the kind of man with whom they have communicated. You will learn what has been written about them from the previous document : and though not all of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> came together to sign, yet it was drawn up by all, and they signed for all. Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. All the brethren salute you.</p>

<p>I, Protogenes , <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, desire that you may be preserved in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, beloved and longed for.</p>

<p>I, Athenodorus*, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, desire that you may be preserved in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, most beloved brethren.

We, Arcidamus and Philoxenus, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and Leo a <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, from <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, desire that you may be preserved. I, Gaudentius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Naissus, desire that you may be preserved in the Lord.
