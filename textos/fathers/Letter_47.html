<h1>Letter 47</h1>

<p> <em>To Proclus</em>,  <em>Bishop of Constantinople.</em></p>

<p>A year ago, thanks to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, the illustrious Philip governor of our city was delivered from serious danger. After entering into the enjoyment of the security which he owed to your kindness, he filled our ears with your praises. But all your labour a certain most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> personage was endeavouring to make null and void. The visitation made several times twelve years ago he <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniates</a>, and has adopted a style of <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> which would be unbecoming even in a respectable slave. Now I beseech your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> to put a stop to his lies, and to induce the illustrious pr&aelig;fects to ratify the decision which they duly and mercifully gave. As a matter of fact our city was taxed more severely than all the cities of the provinces, and after every city had been relieved ours continued to this day assessed at over sixty-two thousand acres. At last the occupants of that seat of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> were with difficulty induced to send inspectors of the district; their report was first received by Isidorus of famous memory and confirmed by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and Christ-loving lord Florentius, and the whole matter was very carefully enquired into by our present ruler, whose equity adorns the throne, and he confirmed the assessment by an imperial decree. But this truth-loving person, all for his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one single individual, the excellent Philip, has declared <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the poor. Under these circumstances I implore your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to array the forces of your righteous eloquence against his eloquence of wrong, to throw your shield over the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which is attacked and at once prove her strength and the futility of lies.</p>
