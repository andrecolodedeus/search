<h1>Letter 47</h1>

<p> <em>To the <a href="../cathen/01300b.htm">Church of Alexandria</a> on the same occasion.</em></p>

<p>Athanasius to all the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Alexandria and the Parembola, brethren most beloved, greeting.</p>

<p>In writing this I must begin my letter, most beloved brethren, by giving thanks to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But now this is especially fitting, since both many things and great, done by the Lord, deserve our thanks , and those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him ought not to be ungrateful for His many benefits. We thank the Lord therefore, who always manifests us to all in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who also has at this time done many wonderful things for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For what the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> party of Eusebius and heirs of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> have maintained and spread abroad, all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who assembled have pronounced false and fictitious. And the very men who are thought terrible by many, like those who are called giants, were counted as nothing, and rightly so, for just as the darkness is illuminated when light comes, so, iniquity is unveiled by the coming of the just, and when the good are present, the worthless are exposed.</p>

<p>For you yourselves, beloved, are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> what the successors of the ill-named <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Eusebius did, namely Theodore, Narcissus, Valens, Ursacius, and the worst of them all, George, Stephen, Acacius, Menophantus, and their colleagues, for their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> is manifest to all; nor has it escaped your observation what they committed against the Churches. For you were the first they injured, your Church the first they tried to corrupt. But they who did so many great things, and were, as I said above, terrible to the minds of all, have been so frightened as to pass all imagination. For not only did they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Roman Synod, not only when invited to it did they excuse themselves, but, now also having arrived at Sardica, so conscience-stricken were they, that when they had seen the judges, they were astonished. So they fainted in their minds. Verily, one might say to them: 'Death, where is your sting, Death, where is your victory?' For neither did it go as they wished, for them to give judgment as they pleased; this time they could not over-reach whom they would. But they saw faithful men, that cared for <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, nay rather, they saw our Lord Himself among them, like the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> of old from the tombs; for being sons of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, they could not bear to see the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. So Theodore, Narcissus, and Ursacius, with their friends said as follows : 'Stay, what have we to do with you, men of Christ? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to be convicted: we shrink from confessing our <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> to your face. We have nothing to do with you; for you are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, while we are foes to Christ; and while with you <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is powerful, we have learned to over-reach. We thought our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> were hid; we did not think that we were now coming to judgment; why do you expose our <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> before their time; and by exposing us vex us before the day?' and although they are of the worst character and walk in darkness, yet they have learned at last that there is no agreement between light and darkness, and no concord between Christ and <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>. Accordingly, beloved brethren, since they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what they had done, and saw their victims  ready as accusers, and the witnesses before their eyes, they followed the example of Cain and fled like him; in that they greatly wandered , for they imitated his flight, and so have received his condemnation. For the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> their works; it has heard our blood crying aloud, heard from themselves the voices of the wounded. All the Bishops <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how they have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and how many things they have done against our Churches and others; and accordingly they have expelled these men from the Churches like Cain. For who did not weep when your letter was read? Who did not groan to see whom those men had exiled? Who did not reckon your tribulations his own? Most beloved brethren, you suffered formerly when they were committing <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you, and perhaps it is no long time since the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> has ceased. Now, however, all the Bishops who assembled and heard what you have suffered, grieved and lamented just as you did when you suffered the injuries and  they shared your grief at that time....</p>

<p>On account of these <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> then, and all the others which they have committed against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> general council has deposed them all, and not only has judged them aliens from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but has held them unworthy to be called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For how can men be called <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who deny Christ? And how can men be admitted to church who do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against the Churches? Accordingly, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> council has sent to the Churches everywhere, that they may be marked among all, so that they who were deceived by them may now return to full assurance and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Do not therefore fail, beloved brethren; like servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and professors of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, be tried in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, and let not tribulation cast you down, neither let troubles caused by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who plot against you make you sad. For you have the sympathy of the whole world in your grief, and what is more, it bears you all in mind. Now I think that those deceived by them will, when they see the severe sentence of the Council, turn aside from them and reject their impiety. If, however, even after this their hand is lifted up, do you not be astonished, nor <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> if they rage; but <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> and raise your hands to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and be sure that the Lord will not tarry but will perform all things according to your will. I could wish indeed to write you a longer letter with a detailed account of what has taken place, but since the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> are competent to tell you in person of all they have seen, I have refrained from writing much. One thing alone I charge you, considering it a necessity, that having the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Lord before your eyes you will put Him first, and carry on all things with your wonted concord as men of wisdom and understanding. Pray for us, bearing in mind the necessities of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> , especially since the enemies of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have taken away what belongs to them. But let your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> overcome the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that according to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the Lord will be gracious and permit me to see you speedily. Meanwhile you will learn the proceedings at the Synod by what all the Bishops have written to you, and from the appended letter you will perceive the deposition of Theodore, Narcissus, Stephen, Acacius, George, Menophantus, Ursacius and Valens. For Gregory they did not wish to mention: since they thought it superfluous to name a man who lacked the very name of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Yet for the sake of those deceived by him they have mentioned his name, not that his name was worthy of mention, but in order that those deceived by him may learn his <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a> and blush for the sort of man they have communicated with. ...I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you may be preserved in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, brethren most beloved and longed for.</p>
