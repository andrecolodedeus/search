<h1>Letter 47</h1>

<p><strong>To Desiderius</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Jerome invites two of his old friends at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, Desiderius and his sister (or wife) Serenilla, to join him at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. It is possible but not probable that this Desiderius is the same with Desiderius of Aquitaine, who afterwards induced Jerome to write against Vigilantius.</span> </p>

<p>An interval of seven years separates this letter (of which the date is 393 A.D.) from the preceding, and all the letters written during this period have wholly perished.</p>

<p>1. Surprised as I have been, my excellent friend, to read the language which your kindness has prompted you to hold concerning me, I have rejoiced that I possess the testimony of one both eloquent and sincere; but when I turn from you to myself I feel vexed that, owing to my unworthiness, your words of praise and eulogy rather weigh me down than lift me up. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, of course, that I make it a principle to raise the standard of humility, and to prepare for scaling the heights by walking for the present in the lowest places. For what am I or what is my significance that I should have the voice of learning raised to bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of me, or that the palm of eloquence should be laid at my feet by one whose style is so charming that it has almost deterred me from writing a letter at all? I must, however, make the attempt in order that charity which seeks not her own <span class="stiki" id="note301027"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:5</a></span> but always her neighbor's good, may at least return a compliment, since it cannot convey a lesson.</p>

<p>2. I offer my congratulations to you and to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and revered sister,  Serenilla, who, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to her name,  has trodden down the troubled waves of the world, and has passed to Christ's calm haven: a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> which&mdash; if we may trust the augury of your name&mdash; is in store for you also. For we read that the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Daniel was called <q>a man of desires,</q>  and the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because he desired to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. Therefore, I do with pleasure what the revered <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a> has asked of me. I urge and implore you both by the charity of the Lord that you will give your presence to us, and that a visit to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places may induce you to enrich us with this great gift. Even supposing that you do not care for our society, it is still your duty as <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> to worship on the spot where the Lord's feet once stood and to see for yourselves the still fresh traces of His birth, His cross, and His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a>.</p>

<p>3. Several of my little pieces have flown away out of their nest, and have rashly sought for themselves the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of publication. I have not sent you any lest I should send works which you already have. But if you care to borrow copies of them, you can do so either from our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sister, Marcella, who has her abode upon the Aventine, or from that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, Domnio, who is the <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> of our times. <span class="stiki" id="note301031"><a href="../bible/2pe002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:7-8</a></span> Meantime, I look for your arrival, and will give you all I have when you once come; or, if any hindrances prevent you from joining us, I will gladly send you such treatises as you shall desire. Following the example of Tranquillus  and of Apollonius the Greek,  I have written a book concerning illustrious men  from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> time to our own; and after enumerating a great number I have put myself down on the last page as one born out of due time, and the least of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note301035"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:8-9</a></span> Here I have found it necessary to give a short account of my writings down to the fourteenth year  of the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>. If you find, on procuring this treatise from the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> mentioned above, that there are any pieces mentioned which you have not already got, I will have them copied for you by degrees, if you wish it.</p>
