<h1>Letter 47 (A.D. 398)</h1>

<p> <em>To the Honourable Publicola, My Much Beloved Son, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. Your perplexities have, since I learned them by your letter, become mine also, not because all those things by which you tell me that you are disturbed, disturb my mind: but I have been much perplexed, I confess, by the question how your perplexities were to be removed; especially since you require me to give a conclusive answer, lest you should fall into greater doubts than you had before you applied to me to have them resolved. For I see that I cannot give this, since, though I may write things which appear to me most certain, if I do not convince you, you must be beyond question more at a loss than before; and though it is in my power to use arguments which weigh with myself, I may fail of convincing another by these. However, lest I should refuse the small service which your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> claims, I have resolved after some consideration to write in reply.</p>

<p>2. One of your doubts is as to using the services of a man who has guaranteed his fidelity by swearing by his false gods. In this matter I beg you to consider whether, in the event of a man failing to keep his word after having pledged himself by such an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, you would not regard him as guilty of a twofold <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For if he kept the engagement which he had confirmed by this <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, he would be pronounced guilty in this only, that he swore by such deities; but no one would <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> blame him for keeping his engagement. But in the case supposed, seeing that he both swore by those whom he should not worship, and did, notwithstanding his promise, what he should not have done, he was guilty of two <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>: whence it is obvious that in using, not for an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> work, but for some good and lawful end, the service of a man whose fidelity is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have been confirmed by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in the name of false gods, one participates, not in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of swearing by the false gods, but in the good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with which he keeps his promise. The <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which I here speak of as kept is not that on account of which those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in Christ are called faithful: that is entirely different and far removed from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> desiderated in regard to the arrangements and compacts of men. Nevertheless it is, beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, worse to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God than to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> by the false gods; for the greater the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of that by which we <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, the greater is the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>. It is therefore a different question whether he is not guilty who requires another to pledge himself by taking an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> in the name of his gods, seeing that he worships false gods. In answering this question, we may accept as decisive those examples which you yourself quoted of Laban and of Abimelech (if Abimelech did <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by his gods, as Laban swore by the god of Nahor). This is, as I have said, another question, and one which would perchance perplex me, were it not for those examples of Isaac and Jacob, to which, for anything I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, others might be added. It may be that some scruple might yet be suggested by the precept in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, <q>Swear not at all;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111673"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;5:34,&nbsp;36</a></span> words which were in my opinion spoken, not because it is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, but because it is a heinous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to forswear oneself: from which crime our Lord would have us keep at a great distance, when He charged us not to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> at all. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, however, that our opinion is different: wherefore it should not be discussed at present; let us rather treat of that about which you have thought of asking my advice. On the same ground on which you forbear from swearing yourself, you may, if such be your opinion, regard it as forbidden to exact an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> from another, although it is expressly said, Swear not; but I do not remember reading anywhere in <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> that we are not to take another's <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>. The question whether we ought to take advantage of the concord which is established between other parties by their exchange of oaths is entirely different. If we answer this in the negative, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether we could find any place on earth in which we could live. For not only on the frontier, but throughout all the provinces, the security of peace rests on the oaths of barbarians. And from this it would follow, that not only the crops which are guarded by men who have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> fidelity in the name of their false gods, but all things which enjoy the protection secured by the peace which a similar <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> has ratified, are defiled. If this be admitted by you to be a complete absurdity, dismiss with it your doubts on the cases which you named.</p>

<p>3. Again, if from the threshing-floor or wine-press of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> anything be taken, with his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, to be offered to false gods, he is guilty in permitting this to be done, if it be in his power to prevent it. If he finds that it has been done, or has not the power to prevent it, he uses without scruple the rest of the grain or wine, as uncontaminated, just as we use fountains from which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that water has been taken to be used in idol-worship. The same principle decides the question about baths. For we have no scruple about inhaling the air into which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the smoke from all the altars and <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> of idolaters ascends. From which it is manifest, that the thing forbidden is our devoting anything to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the false gods, or appearing to do this by so acting as to encourage in such worship those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> our <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, although in our heart we despise their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. And when temples, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, groves, etc., are thrown down by permission from the authorities, although our taking part in this work is a clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of our not honouring, but rather abhorring, these things, we must nevertheless forbear from appropriating any of them to our own personal and private use; so that it may be manifest that in overthrowing these we are influenced, not by greed, but by <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. When, however, the spoils of these places are applied to the benefit of the community or devoted to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are dealt with in the same manner as the men themselves when they are turned from impiety and sacrilege to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion. We understand this to be the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the examples quoted by yourself: the grove of the false gods from which He commanded wood to be taken [by Gideon] for the burnt-offering; and <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a>, of which all the gold, silver, and brass was to be brought into the Lord's treasury. Hence also the precept in Deuteronomy: <q>You shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto you, lest you be snared therein; for it is an abomination to the Lord your God. Neither shall you bring an abomination into your house, lest you become a cursed thing like it: but you shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111674"><a href="../bible/deu007.htm#verse25">Deuteronomy&nbsp;7:25-26</a></span> From which it appears plainly, that either the appropriation of such spoils to their own private use was absolutely forbidden, or they were forbidden to carry anything of that kind into their own houses with the intention of giving to it <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; for then this would be an abomination and accursed in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; whereas the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> impiously given to such <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> is, by their public destruction, utterly abolished.</p>

<p>4. As to meats offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, I assure you we have no duty beyond observing what the apostle taught concerning them. Study, therefore, his words on the subject, which, if they were obscure to you, I would explain as well as I could. He does not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> who, unwittingly, afterwards partakes of food which he formerly refused because it had been offered to an idol. A kitchen-herb, or any other fruit of the ground, belongs to Him who created it; for <q>the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof,</q> and <q>every creature of God is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q>  But if that which the earth has borne is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> or offered to an idol, then we must reckon it among the things offered to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. We must beware lest, in pronouncing that we ought not to eat the fruits of a garden belonging to an idol-temple, we be involved in the inference that it was wrong for the apostle to take food in Athens, since that city belonged to Minerva, and was <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to her as the guardian deity. The same answer I would give as to the well or fountain enclosed in a temple, though my scruples would be somewhat more awakened if some part of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> be thrown into the said well or fountain. But the case is, as I have said before, exactly parallel to our using of the air which receives the smoke of these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; or, if this be thought to make a difference, that the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, the smoke whereof mingles with the air, is not offered to the air itself, but to some idol or false god, whereas sometimes offerings are cast into the water with the intention of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> to the waters themselves, it is enough to say that the same principle would preclude us from using the light of the sun, because <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men continually worship that luminary wherever they are tolerated in doing so. Sacrifices are offered to the winds, which we nevertheless use for our convenience, although they seem, as it were, to inhale and swallow greedily the smoke of these <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>. If any one be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> regarding meat, whether it has been offered to an idol or not, and the fact be that it has not, when he eats that meat under the impression that it has not been offered to an idol, he by no means does wrong; because neither in fact, nor now in his judgment, is it food offered to an idol, although he formerly thought it was. For surely it is lawful to correct false impressions by others that are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But if any one believes that to be good which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and acts accordingly, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in entertaining that belief; and these are all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, in which one thinks that to be right which it is wrong for him to do.</p>

<p>5. As to killing others in order to defend one's own life, I do not approve of this, unless one happen to be a soldier or public functionary acting, not for himself, but in defence of others or of the city in which he resides, if he act according to the commission lawfully given him, and in the manner becoming his office.  When, however, men are prevented, by being alarmed, from doing wrong, it may be said that a real service is done to themselves. The precept, <q>Resist not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111677"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39</a></span> was given to prevent us from taking pleasure in revenge, in which the mind is gratified by the sufferings of others, but not to make us neglect the duty of restraining men from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. From this it follows that one is not guilty of homicide, because he has put up a wall round his estate, if any one is killed by the wall falling upon him when he is throwing it down. For a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is not guilty of homicide though his ox may gore or his horse kick a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, so that he dies. On such a principle, the oxen of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> should have no horns, and his horses no hoofs, and his dogs no teeth. On such a principle, when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> took care to inform the chief captain that an ambush was laid for him by certain desperadoes, and received in consequence an armed escort, <span class="stiki" id="note111678"><a href="../bible/act023.htm#verse17">Acts&nbsp;23:17-24</a></span> if the villains who plotted his death had thrown themselves on the weapons of the soldiers, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> would have had to acknowledge the shedding of their blood as a crime with which he was chargeable. God forbid that we should be blamed for accidents which, without our desire, happen to others through things done by us or found in our possession, which are in themselves good and lawful. In that event, we ought to have no iron implements for the house or the field, lest some one should by them lose his own life or take another's; no tree or rope on our premises, lest some one hang himself; no window in our house, lest some one throw himself down from it. But why mention more in a list which must be interminable? For what good and lawful thing is there in use among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> which may not become chargeable with being an instrument of destruction?</p>

<p>6. I have now only to notice (unless I am mistaken) the case which you mentioned of a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> on a journey overcome by the extremity of hunger; whether, if he could find nothing to eat but meat placed in an idol's temple, and there was no man near to relieve him, it would be better for him to die of starvation than to take that food for his nourishment? Since in this question it is not assumed that the food thus found was offered to the idol (for it might have been left by mistake or designedly by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, on a journey, had turned aside there to take refreshment; or it might have been put there for some other purpose), I answer briefly thus: Either it is certain that this food was offered to the idol, or it is certain that it was not, or neither of these things is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>. If it is certain, it is better to reject it with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>. In either of the other alternatives, it may be used for his necessity without any conscientious scruple.</p>
