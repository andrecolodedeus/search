<h1>Letter 48</h1>

<p> <em>Letter to Amun.  Written before 354 a.d. </em></p>

<p>All things made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> are beautiful and pure, for the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> has made nothing useless or impure. For 'we are a sweet savour of Christ in them that are being saved <span class="stiki" id="note284584"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15</a></span>,' as the Apostle says. But since the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> darts are varied and subtle, and he contrives to trouble those who are of simpler <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and tries to hinder the ordinary exercises of the brethren, scattering secretly among them thoughts of uncleanness and defilement; come let us briefly dispel the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, and confirm the mind of the simple. For 'to the pure all things are pure,' but both the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and all that belongs to the unclean are defiled. <span class="stiki" id="note284585"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse15">Titus&nbsp;1:15</a></span> I marvel also at the craft of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in that, although he is corruption and mischief itself, he suggests thoughts under the show of purity; but with the result of a snare rather than a test. For with the object, as I said before, of distracting <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetics</a> from their customary and salutary meditation, and of appearing to overcome them, he stirs some such buzzing thoughts as are of no profit in life, vain questions and frivolities which one ought to put aside. For tell me, beloved and most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> friend, what <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> or uncleanness there is in any natural secretion&mdash;as though a man were minded to make a culpable matter of the cleanings of the nose or the sputa from the mouth? And we may add also the secretions of the belly, such as are a physical necessity of animal life. Moreover if we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> man to be, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> say, a work of God's hands, how could any defiled work proceed from a pure Power? And if, according to the divine Acts of the Apostles <span class="stiki" id="note284586"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;17:28</a></span>, 'we are God's offspring,' we have nothing unclean in ourselves. For then only do we incur defilement, when we commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that foulest of things. But when any bodily excretion takes place independently of will, then we experience this, like other things, by a necessity of nature. But since those whose only pleasure is to gainsay what is said aright, or rather what is made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, pervert even a saying in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, alleging that 'not that which goes in defiles a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but that which goes out <span class="stiki" id="note284587"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;15:11</a></span>,' we are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to make plain this unreasonableness,&mdash; for I cannot call it a question&mdash; of theirs. For firstly, like unstable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, they wrest the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284588"><a href="../bible/2pe003.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:16</a></span> to their own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Now the sense of the divine oracle is as follows. Certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, like these of today, were in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about meats. The Lord Himself, to dispel their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, or it may be to unveil their deceitfulness, lays down that, not what goes in defiles the man, but what goes out. Then he adds exactly whence they go out, namely from the heart. For there, as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, are the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> treasures of profane thoughts and other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But the Apostle teaches the same thing more concisely, saying, 'But meat shall not bring us before God <span class="stiki" id="note284589"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:8</a></span>.' Moreover, one might reasonably say no natural secretion will bring us before him for punishment. But possibly medical men (to put these people to shame even at the hands of outsiders) will support us on this point, telling us that there are certain necessary passages accorded to the animal body, to provide for the dismissal of the superfluity of what is secreted in our several parts; for example, for the superfluity of the head, the hair and the watery discharges from the head, and the purgings of the belly, and that superfluity again of the seminative channels. What <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> then is there in God's name, elder most beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if the Master who made the body willed and made these parts to have such passages? But since we must grapple with the objections of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as they may say, 'If the organs have been severally fashioned by the Creator, then there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in their genuine use,' let us stop them by asking this question: What do you mean by use? That lawful use which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> permitted when He said, 'Increase and multiply, and replenish the earth <span class="stiki" id="note284590"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span>,' and which the Apostle approves in the words, 'Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and the bed undefiled <span class="stiki" id="note284591"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span>,' or that use which is public, yet carried on stealthily and in adulterous fashion? For in other matters also which go to make up life, we shall find differences according to circumstances. For example, it is not right to kill, yet in <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> it is lawful and praiseworthy to destroy the enemy; accordingly not only are they who have distinguished themselves in the field held worthy of great honours, but monuments are put up proclaiming their achievements. So that the same act is at one time and under some circumstances unlawful, while under others, and at the right time, it is lawful and permissible. The same reasoning applies to the relation of the sexes. He is blessed who, being freely yoked in his youth, naturally begets children. But if he uses nature licentiously, the punishment of which the Apostle <span class="stiki" id="note284592"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> writes shall await whoremongers and adulterers.</p>

<p>For there are two ways in life, as touching these matters. The one the more moderate and ordinary, I mean marriage; the other angelic and unsurpassed, namely <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. Now if a man choose the way of the world, namely marriage, he is not indeed to blame; yet he will not receive such great gifts as the other. For he will receive, since he too brings forth fruit, namely thirtyfold.  But if a man embrace the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and unearthly way, even though, as compared with the former, it be rugged and hard to accomplish, yet it has the more wonderful gifts: for it grows the perfect fruit, namely an hundredfold. So then their unclean and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> objections had their proper solution long since given in the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. Strengthen then, father, the flocks  under you, exhorting them from the Apostolic writings, guiding them from the Evangelical, counselling them from the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, and saying, 'quicken me according to Your Word ;' but by 'Your Word,' is meant that we should serve Him with a pure heart. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, the Prophet says, as if interpreting himself, 'Make me a clean heart, O God ,' lest filthy thoughts trouble me. David again, 'And establish me with Your free spirit ,' that even if ever thoughts disturb me, a certain strong power from You may establish me, acting as a support. Giving then this and the like advice, say with regard to those who are slow to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, 'I will teach Your ways unto the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>,' and, confident in the Lord that you will persuade them to desist from such <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, sing 'and sinners shall be converted unto You. ' And be it granted, that they who raise malicious questions may cease from such vain labour, and that they who <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in their simplicity may be strengthened with a 'free spirit.' while as many of you as surely <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, hold it unbroken and unshaken in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, with whom be to the Father <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and might, together with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
