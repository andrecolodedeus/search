<h1>Letter 49</h1>

<p> <em>Letter to Dracontius.  Written a.d. 354 or 355.</em></p>

<p>I am at a loss how to write. Am I to blame you for your refusal? Or for having regard to the trials, and hiding for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> ? In any case, however it may be, what you have done is worthy of blame, beloved Dracontius. For it was not fitting that after receiving the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> you should hide, nor that, being a wise man, you should furnish others with a pretext for flight. For many are offended when they hear it; not merely that you have done this, but that you have done it having regard to the times and to the afflictions which are weighing upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest, in flying for your own sake, you prove to be in peril in the sight of the Lord on account of others. For if 'he that offends one of the little ones, should rather choose that a mill stone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea <span class="stiki" id="note284601"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;18:6</a></span>,' what can be in store for you, if you prove an offense to so many? For the surprising unanimity about your election in the district  of Alexandria will of necessity be broken up by your retirement: and the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the district will be grasped at by many&mdash;and many unfit <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, as you are well aware. And many <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> who were promising to become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> upon your election will remain <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, if your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> sets at nought the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given you.</p>

<p>2. What defence will you offer for such conduct? With what arguments will you be able to wash away and efface such an impeachment? How will you heal those who on your account are fallen and offended? Or how will you be able to restore the broken peace? Beloved Dracontius, you have caused us grief instead of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, groaning instead of consolation. For we expected to have you with us as a consolation; and now we behold you in flight, and that you will be convicted in judgment, and when upon your trial will repent it. And 'Who shall have pity upon you <span class="stiki" id="note284603"><a href="../bible/jer015.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;15:5</a></span>,' as the Prophet says, who will turn his mind to you for peace, when he sees the brethren for whom Christ died injured on account of your flight? For you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and not be in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, that while before your election you lived to yourself, after it, you live for your flock. And before you had received the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you; but after you became one, the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> expect you to bring them food, namely instruction from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. When then they expect, and suffer hunger, and you are feeding yourself <span class="stiki" id="note284604"><a href="../bible/eze034.htm#verse2">Ezekiel&nbsp;34:2</a></span> only, and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> comes and we stand before Him, what defence will you offer when He sees His own sheep hungering? For had you not taken the money, He would not have blamed you. But He would reasonably do so if upon taking it you dug and buried it&mdash;in the words which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid that your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> should ever hear: 'You ought to have given my money to the bankers, that when I came I might demand it of them. '</p>

<p>3. I beseech you, spare yourself and us. Yourself, lest you run into peril; us, lest we be grieved because of you. Take thought of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest many of the little ones be injured on your account, and the others be given an occasion of withdrawing. Nay but if you feared the times and acted as you did from timidity, your mind is not manly; for in such a case you ought to manifest <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and rather meet circumstances boldly, and use the language of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>: 'in all these things we are more than conquerors <span class="stiki" id="note284606"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse37">Romans&nbsp;8:37</a></span>;' and the more so in that we ought to serve not the time, but the Lord.  But if the organising of the Churches is distasteful to you, and you do not think the ministry of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> has its reward, why, then you have brought yourself to despise the Saviour that ordered these things. I beseech you, dismiss such ideas, nor tolerate those who advise you in such a sense, for this is not worthy of Dracontius. For the order the Lord has established by the Apostles abides fair and firm; but the cowardice of the brethren shall cease. </p>

<p>4. For if all were of the same mind as your present advisers, how would you have become a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, since there would be no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>? Or if our successors are to inherit this state of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, how will the Churches be able to hold together? Or do your advisers think that you have received nothing, that they despise it? If so surely they are wrong. For it is time for them to think that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Font is nothing, if some are found to despise it. But you have received it, beloved Dracontius; do not tolerate your advisers nor deceive yourself. For this will be required of you by the God who gave it. Have you not heard the Apostle say, 'Neglect not the gift that is in you <span class="stiki" id="note284609"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:14</a></span>?' or have you not read how he accepts the man that had doubled his money, while he condemned the one that had hidden it? But may it come to pass that you may quickly return, in order that you too may be one of those who are praised. Or tell me, whom do your advisers wish you to imitate? For we ought to walk by the standard of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and the fathers, and imitate them, and to be sure that if we depart from them we put ourselves also out of their fellowship. Whom then do they wish you to imitate? The one who hesitated, and while wishing to follow, delayed it and took counsel because of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284610"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse61">Luke&nbsp;2:61</a></span>, or <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, who, the moment the stewardship was entrusted to him, 'straightway conferred not with flesh and blood <span class="stiki" id="note284611"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;1:16</a></span>?' For although he said, 'I am not worthy to be called an Apostle <span class="stiki" id="note284612"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:9</a></span>,' yet, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what he had received, and being not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the giver, he wrote, 'For woe is me if I preach not the gospel. ' But, as it was 'woe to me' if he did not preach, so, in teaching and preaching the gospel, he had his converts as his <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and crown. <span class="stiki" id="note284614"><a href="../bible/1th002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;2:19</a></span> This explains why the saint  was <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> to preach as far as <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, and not to shrink from proceeding to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284616"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;1:15</a></span>, or even going as far as the Spains , in order that the more he laboured, he might receive so much the greater reward for his labour. He boasted then that he had fought the good fight, and was confident that he should receive the great crown. <span class="stiki" id="note284618"><a href="../bible/2ti004.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:7-8</a></span> Therefore, beloved Dracontius, whom are you imitating in your present action? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, or men unlike him? For my part, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you, and myself, may prove an imitator of all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</p>

<p>5. Or possibly there are some who advise you to hide, because you have given your word upon <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> not to accept the office if elected. For I hear that they are buzzing in your ears to this effect, and consider that they are thus acting conscientiously. But if they were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> conscientious, they would above all have feared <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who imposed this ministry upon you. Or if they had read the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>, they would not have advised you contrary to them. For it is time for them to blame Jeremiah also, and to impeach the great <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, in that they did not listen to their advice, but fearing God fulfilled their ministry, and prophesying were made perfect. For they also when they had received their mission and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Prophecy, refused. But afterwards they feared, and did not set at nought Him that sent them. Whether then you be of stammering utterance, and slow of tongue, yet <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God that made you, or if you call yourself too young to preach, yet reverence Him Who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you before you were made. Or if you have given your word (now their word was to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> as an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>), yet read Jeremiah, how he too had said, 'I will not name the Name of the Lord <span class="stiki" id="note284619"><a href="../bible/jer020.htm#verse9">Jeremiah&nbsp;20:9</a></span>,' yet afterwards he feared the fire kindled within him, and did not do as he had said, nor hid himself as if bound by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, but reverenced Him that had entrusted to him his office, and fulfilled the prophetic call. Or are you not aware, beloved, that Jonah also fled, but met with the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> that befell him, after which he returned and prophesied?</p>

<p>6. Do not then entertain counsels opposite to this. For the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> our case better than we ourselves, and He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to whom He is entrusting His Churches. For even if a man be not worthy, yet let him not look at his former life, but let him carry out his ministry, lest, in addition to his life he incur also the curse of negligence. I ask you, beloved Dracontius, whether <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, and being a wise man, you are not pricked in your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Do you not feel anxious lest any of those entrusted to you should perish? Do you not burn, as with a fire in your <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? Are you not in <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the day of judgment, in which none of your present advisers will be there to aid you? For each shall give account of those entrusted to his hands. For how did his excuse benefit the man who hid the money? Or how did it benefit <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> to say, 'The <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> beguiled me <span class="stiki" id="note284620"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse12">Genesis&nbsp;3:12</a></span>?' Beloved Dracontius, even if you are really weak, yet you ought to take up the charge, lest, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> being unoccupied, the enemies injure it, taking advantage of your flight. You should gird yourself up, so as not to leave us alone in the struggle; you should labour with us, in order to receive the reward also along with all.</p>

<p>7. Make haste then, beloved, and tarry no longer, nor suffer those who would prevent you: but remember Him that has given, and come hither to us who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you, who give you Scriptural advice, in order that you may both be installed by ourselves, and, as you minister in the churches make remembrance of us. For you are not the only one who has been elected from among <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, nor the only one to have presided over a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, or to have been beloved by <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. But you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that not only was Serapion a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, and presided over that number of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; you were not unaware of how many <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> Apollos was father; you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Agathon, and are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of Ariston. You remember Ammonius who went abroad  with Serapion. Perhaps you have also heard of Muitus  in the upper Thebaid, and can learn about <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>  at Latopolis, and many others. And yet these, when elected, did not gainsay; but taking Elisha as an example, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> the story of Elijah, and having learned all about the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, they grappled with the charge, and did not despise the ministry, and were not inferior to themselves, but rather look for the reward of their labour, advancing themselves, and guiding others onward. For how many have they turned away from the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>? How many have they caused to cease from their familiarity with <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> by their warning? How many servants have they brought to the Lord, so as to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> those who saw such wonders to marvel at the sight? Or is it not a great wonder to make a damsel live as a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, and a young man live in continence, and an idolater come to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ?</p>

<p>8. Let not <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> then prevent you, as though you alone had been elected from among <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; nor do you make excuses, to the effect that you will deteriorate. For you may even grow better if you imitate <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and follow up the actions of the Saints. For you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that men like those, when appointed stewards of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, all the more pressed forward to the mark of their high calling. <span class="stiki" id="note284624"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse14">Philippians&nbsp;3:14</a></span> When did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> meet <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> and expect to receive his crown, if not after being sent to teach? When did Peter make his confession, if not when he was preaching the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and had become a fisher of men <span class="stiki" id="note284625"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;4:19</a></span>? When was Elijah taken up, if not after completing his prophetic career? When did Elisha gain a double share of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, if not after leaving all to follow Elijah? Or why did the Saviour choose <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if not to send them out as <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>?</p>

<p>9. So take these as an example, beloved Dracontius, and do not say, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those who say, that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> office is an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, nor that it gives rise to <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For it is possible for you also as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to hunger and thirst <span class="stiki" id="note284626"><a href="../bible/phi004.htm#verse12">Philippians&nbsp;4:12</a></span>, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> did. You can drink no wine, like Timothy <span class="stiki" id="note284627"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:23</a></span>, and fast constantly too, like <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284628"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse27">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:27</a></span>, in order that thus <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> after his example you may feast others with your words, and while thirsting for lack of drink, water others by teaching. Let not your advisers, then, allege these things. For we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who fast, and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who eat. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who drink no wine, as well as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who do. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who work  wonders, as well as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who do not. Many also of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have not even married, while <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> have been  fathers of children; just as conversely we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are fathers of children and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> 'of the completest kind. ' And again, we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who suffer hunger, and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who fast. For it is possible in the latter way, and not forbidden in the former. But let a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, wherever he is, strive earnestly; for the crown is given not according to position, but according to action.</p>

<p>10. Do not then suffer those who give contrary advice. But rather hasten and delay not; the more so as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> festival is approaching; so that the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> may not keep the feast without you, and you bring great danger upon yourself. For who will in your absence preach them the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> sermon? Who will announce to them the great day of the Resurrection, if you art in hiding? Who will counsel them, if you are in flight, to keep the feast fittingly? Ah, how many will be the better if you appear, how many be injured if you fly! And who will think well of you for this? And why do they advise you not to take up the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> office, when they themselves wish to have <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> ? For if you are bad, let them not associate with you. But if they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are good, let them not <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> the others. For if, as they say, teaching and government is an occasion of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, let them not be taught themselves, nor have <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, lest they deteriorate, both they and those who teach them. But do not attend to these <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sayings, nor suffer those who give such advice, as I have often already said. But rather make haste and turn to the Lord, in order that, taking thought for his sheep, you may remember us also. But to this end I have bidden our beloved Hierax, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and Maximus the reader go, and bid you by word of mouth also, that you may be able thus to learn both with what feelings I have written, and the danger that results from gainsaying the ordinance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
