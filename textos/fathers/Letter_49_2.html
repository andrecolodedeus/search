<h1>Letter 49</h1>

<p><strong>To Pammachius</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Jerome encloses the preceding letter, thanks Pammachius for his efforts to suppress his treatise <q>against Jovinian,</q> but declares these to be useless, and exhorts him, if he still has any hesitation in his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to turn to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and the commentaries made upon them by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and others. Written at the same time as the preceding letter.</span> </p>

<p>1. <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> modesty sometimes requires us to be silent even to our friends, and to nurse our humility in peace, where the renewal of an old friendship would expose us to the charge of self-seeking. Thus, when you have kept silence I have kept silence too, and have not cared to remonstrate with you, lest I should be thought more anxious to conciliate a person of influence than to cultivate a friend. But, now that it has become a duty to reply to your letter, I will endeavor always to be beforehand with you, and not so much to answer your queries as to write independently of them. Thus, if I have shown my modesty hitherto by silence, I will henceforth show it still more by coming forward to speak.</p>

<p>2. I quite recognize the kindness and forethought which have induced you to withdraw from circulation some copies of my work against Jovinian. Your diligence, however, has been of no avail, for several people coming from the city have repeatedly read aloud to me passages which they have come across in Rome. In this province, also, the books have already been circulated; and, as you have read yourself in Horace, <q>Words once uttered cannot be recalled.</q>  I am not so fortunate as are most of the writers of the day&mdash; able, that is, to correct my trifles whenever I like. When once I have written anything, either my admirers or my ill-wishers&mdash; from different motives, but with equal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>&mdash; sow my work broadcast among the public; and their language, whether it is that of eulogy or of criticism, is apt to run to excess.  They are guided not by the merits of the piece, but by their own <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> feelings. Accordingly, I have done what I could. I have dedicated to you a defence of the work in question, feeling sure that when you have read it you will yourself satisfy the doubts of others on my behalf; or else, if you too turn up your nose at the task, you will have to explain in some new manner that section of the apostle <span class="stiki" id="note301203"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;vii</a></span> in which he discusses <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> and marriage.</p>

<p>3. I do not speak thus that I may provoke you to write on the subject yourself&mdash; although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in the study of the sacred writings to be greater than my own&mdash; but that you may compel my tormentors to do so. They are <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>; in their own eyes no mean scholars; competent not merely to censure but to instruct me. If they write on the subject, my view will be the sooner neglected when it is compared with theirs. Read, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, and diligently consider the words of the apostle, and you will then see that&mdash; with a view to avoid misrepresentation&mdash; I have been much more gentle towards married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> than he was disposed to be. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, Dionysius, Pierius, Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea, Didymus, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, have used great latitude in the interpretation of this epistle.  When Pierius, sifting and expounding the apostle's meaning, comes to the words, <q>I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as I myself,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301205"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span> he makes this comment upon them: <q>In saying this <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> plainly preaches abstinence from marriage.</q>  Is the fault here mine, or am I responsible for harshness? Compared with this sentence of Pierius,  all that I have ever written is mild indeed. Consult the commentaries of the above-named writers and take advantage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a>; you will then more speedily finish as you would wish the enterprise which you have so happily begun. </p>

<p>4. I hear that the hopes of the entire city are centred in you, and that <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>  and people are agreed in wishing for your exaltation. To be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>  is much, to deserve to be one is more.</p>

<p>If you read the books of the sixteen <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>  which I have rendered into Latin from the Hebrew; and if, when you have done so, you express satisfaction with my labors, the news will encourage me to take out of my desk some other works now shut up in it. I have lately translated Job into our mother tongue: you will be able to borrow a copy of it from your cousin, the saintly Marcella. Read it both in Greek and in Latin, and compare the old version with my rendering. You will then clearly see that the difference between them is that between <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. Some of my commentaries upon the twelve <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> I have sent to the reverend father Domnio, also the four books of Kings&mdash; that is, the two called Samuel and the two called Mal&acirc;chim.  If you care to read these you will learn for yourself how difficult it is to understand the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, and particularly the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; and how through the fault of the translators passages which for the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> flow clearly on for us abound with mistakes. Once more, you must not in my small writings look for any such eloquence as that which for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> sake you disregard in Cicero. A version made for the use of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even though it may possess a literary charm, ought to disguise and avoid it as far as possible; in order that it may not speak to the idle schools and few <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, but may address itself rather to the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>.</p>
