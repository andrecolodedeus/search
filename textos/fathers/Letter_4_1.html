<h1>Letter 4</h1>

<p> <em>For 332. Easter-day vii Pharmuthi , iv Non. Apr.; &AElig;ra Dioclet. 48; Coss. Fabius Pacatianus, M&aelig;cilius Hilarianus; Pr&aelig;fect, Hyginus ; Indict. v.</em></p>

<p> <em>He sent this Letter from the Emperor's Court by a soldier. </em></p>

<p>I send unto you, my beloved, late and beyond the accustomed time ; yet I trust you will forgive the delay, on account of my protracted journey, and because I have been tried with illness. Being hindered by these two causes, and unusually severe storms having occurred, I have deferred writing to you. But notwithstanding my long journeys, and my grievous sickness, I have not forgotten to give you the festal notification, and, in discharge of my duty, I now announce to you the feast. For although the date of this letter is later  than that usual for this announcement, it should still be considered well-timed, since our enemies having been put to shame and reproved by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> us without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> , we may now sing a festal song of praise, uttering the triumphant hymn against <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>; 'We will sing unto the Lord, for He is to be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">gloriously</a> praised; the horse and his rider He has cast into the sea <span class="stiki" id="note284029"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse1">Exodus&nbsp;15:1</a></span>.'</p>

<p>2. It is well, my beloved, to proceed from feast to feast; again festal meetings, again <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> arouse our minds, and compel our <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> to keep vigil unto <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things. Let us not fulfil these days like those that mourn, but, by enjoying spiritual food, let us seek to silence our fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>.  For by these means we shall have strength to overcome our adversaries, like blessed Judith <span class="stiki" id="note284031"><a href="../bible/jth013.htm#verse8">Judith&nbsp;13:8</a></span>, when having first exercised herself in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, she overcame the enemies, and killed Olophernes. And blessed Esther, when destruction was about to come on all her race, and the nation of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was ready to perish, defeated the fury of the tyrant by no other means than by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and changed the ruin of her people into safety. <span class="stiki" id="note284032"><a href="../bible/est004.htm#verse16">Esther&nbsp;4:16</a></span> Now as those days are considered feasts for <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, so also in old time feasts were appointed when an enemy was slain, or a conspiracy against the people broken up, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> delivered. Therefore blessed <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> of old time ordained the great <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the Passover</a>, and our celebration of it, because, namely, <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> was killed, and the people were delivered from bondage. For in those times it was especially, when those who tyrannized over the people had been slain, that temporal feasts and holidays were observed in Jud&aelig;a. </p>

<p>3. Now, however, that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, that tyrant against the whole world, is slain, we do not approach a temporal feast, my beloved, but an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> and heavenly. Not in shadows do we show it forth, but we come to it in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For they being filled with the flesh of a dumb lamb, accomplished the feast, and having anointed their door-posts with the blood, implored aid against the destroyer.  But now we, eating of the Word of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and having the lintels of our hearts sealed with the blood of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284035"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;26:28</a></span>, acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given us from the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, who said, 'Behold, I have given unto you to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. ' For no more does death reign; but instead of death henceforth is life, since our Lord said, 'I am the life <span class="stiki" id="note284037"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span>;' so that everything is filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>; as it is written, 'The Lord reigns, let the earth <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.' For when death reigned, 'sitting down by the rivers of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, we wept ,' and mourned, because we felt the bitterness of captivity; but now that death and the kingdom of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is abolished, everything is entirely filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. And God is no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> only in Jud&aelig;a, but in all the earth, 'their voice has gone forth, and the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him has filled all the earth. ' What follows, my beloved, is obvious; that we should approach such a feast, not with filthy raiment, but having clothed our minds with pure garments. For we need in this to put on our Lord Jesus <span class="stiki" id="note284040"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;13:14</a></span>, that we may be able to celebrate the feast with Him. Now we are clothed with Him when we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and are enemies to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, when we exercise ourselves in <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a> and mortify lasciviousness, when we <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> righteousness before iniquity, when we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> sufficiency, and have strength of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, when we do not forget the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, but open our doors to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, when we assist humble-mindedness, but <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>.</p>

<p>4. By these things <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> of old, having first, as in a figure, striven for the victory, came to the feast, for these things were then foreshadowed and typified. But we, my beloved, the shadow having received its fulfilment, and the types being accomplished, should no longer consider the feast typical, neither should we go up to Jerusalem which is here below, to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, according to the unseasonable observance of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, lest, while the season passes away, we should be regarded as acting unseasonably ; but, in accordance with the injunction of the Apostles, let us go beyond the types, and sing the new song of praise. For perceiving this, and being assembled together with the Truth , they drew near, and said unto our Saviour, 'Where will You that we should make ready for You the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284043"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;26:17</a></span>?' For no longer were these things to be done which belonged to Jerusalem which is beneath; neither there alone was the feast to be celebrated, but wherever God willed it to be. Now He willed it to be in every place, so that 'in every place <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> and a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> might be offered to Him <span class="stiki" id="note284044"><a href="../bible/mal001.htm#verse11">Malachi&nbsp;1:11</a></span>.' For although, as in the historical account, in no other place might the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the Passover</a> be kept save only in Jerusalem, yet when the things pertaining to that time were fulfilled, and those which belonged to shadows had passed away, and the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> was about to extend everywhere; when indeed the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> were spreading the feast in all places, they asked the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, 'Where will You that we shall make ready?' The Saviour also, since He was changing the typical for the spiritual, promised them that they should no longer eat the flesh of a lamb, but His own, saying, 'Take, eat and drink; this is My body, and My blood. ' When we are thus nourished by these things, we also, my beloved, shall <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">feast of the Passover</a>.</p>

<p>5. We begin on the first of Pharmuthi (March 27), and rest on the sixth of the same month (Apr. 1), on the evening of the seventh day; and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> first day of the week having risen upon us on the seventh of the same Pharmuthi (Apr. 2), celebrate we too the days of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pentecost following thereon, showing forth through them the world to come , so that henceforth we may be with <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> for ever, praising God over all in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>, and through Him, with all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, we say unto the Lord, <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>. All the brethren who are with me salute you. We have sent this letter from the Court, by the hand of an attendant officer , to whom it was given by Ablavius , the Pr&aelig;fect of the Pr&aelig;torium, who fears God in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For I am at the Court, having been summoned by the emperor Constantine to see him. But the <a href="../cathen/10164a.htm">Meletians</a>, who were present there, being <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, sought our ruin before the Emperor. But they were put to shame and driven away thence as <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>, being confuted by many things. Those who were driven away were Callinicus, Ision, Eud&aelig;mon, and Gel&oelig;us  Hieracammon, who, on account of the shame of his name, calls himself Eulogius.</p>

<p>Here ends the fourth Festal Letter of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Athanasius.</p>
