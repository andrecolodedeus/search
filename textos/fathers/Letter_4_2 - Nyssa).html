<h1>Letter 4</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. GREGORY OF NYSSA</em></strong></p>

<p> <em>To Cynegius</em> </p>

<p>We have a law that bids us <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with them that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, and weep with them that weep</q>: but of these commandments it often seems that it is in our power to put only one into practice. For there is a great scarcity in the world of <q>them that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>,</q> so that it is not easy to find with whom we may share our blessings, but there are plenty who are in the opposite case. I write thus much by way of preface, because of the sad tragedy which some spiteful power has been playing among people of long-standing nobility. A young man of good <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, Synesius by name, not unconnected with myself, in the full flush of youth, who has scarcely begun to live yet, is in great dangers, from which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> alone has power to rescue him, and next to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you, who are entrusted with the decisions of all questions of life and death. An involuntary mishap has taken place. Indeed, what mishap is <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a>? And now those who have made up this suit against him, carrying with it the penalty of death, have turned his mishap into matter of accusation. However, I will try by private letters to soften their resentment and incline them to pity; but I beseech your kindliness to side with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and with us, that your benevolence may prevail over the wretched plight of the youth, hunting up any and every device by which the young man may be placed out of the reach of danger, having conquered the spiteful power which assails him by the help of your alliance. I have said all that I want in brief; but to go into details, in order that my endeavour may be successful, would be to say what I have no business to say, nor you to hear from me.</p>
