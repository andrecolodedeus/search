<h1>Letter 50</h1>

<p> <em>First Letter to Lucifer. </em></p>

<p>To our lord, and most beloved brother the Bishop and Confessor Lucifer. Athanasius greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>Being well in body by God's favour, we have now sent our most beloved <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Eutyches, that your most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, as is much desired by us, may be pleased to inform us of the safety of yourself and those with you. For we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it is by the life of you Confessors and servants of God that the state of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is renewed; and that what <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have assayed to rend in pieces, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> by your means restores whole.</p>

<p>For although the forerunners of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> have by the power of this world done everything to put out the lantern of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, yet the Deity by your confession shows its light all the clearer, so that none can fail to see their deceit. Heretofore perhaps they were able to dissimulate: now they are called Antichrists. For who can but execrate them, and fly from their communion like a taint, or the poison of a serpent? The whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> everywhere is mourning, every city groans, aged <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are suffering in exile, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> dissembling, who while denying Christ have made themselves <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publicans</a>, sitting in the Churches and exacting revenue.  O new kind of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has devised, namely to use such cruelty, and even ministers as the agents of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But although they act thus, and have gone all lengths in <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, yet your confession, your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and wisdom, will be the very greatest comfort and solace to the brotherhood. For it has been reported to us that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has written to Constantius Augustus; and we wonder more and more that dwelling as it were among scorpions you yet preserve freedom of spirit, in order, by advice or teaching or correction, to bring those in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I ask then, and all confessors join me in asking, that you will be good enough to send us a copy; so that all may perceive, not by hearsay only but by letters, the valour of your spirit, and the confidence and firmness of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Those who are with me salute your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. I salute all those who are with you. May the deity ever keep you safe and sound and mindful of us, most beloved lord, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> man of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Upon receiving this letter, blessed Lucifer sent the books which he had addressed to Constantius; and when he had read them Athanasius sent <a href="../fathers/2806051.htm">Letter 51</a>.</em></p>
