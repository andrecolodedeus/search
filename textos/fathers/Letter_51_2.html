<h1>Letter 51</h1>

<p class="c30"> <span class="c1">Letter LI. From Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, to John, Bishop of Jerusalem.</span> </p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>A coolness had arisen between these two <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in connection with the Origenistic controversy, which at this time was at its height. Epiphanius had openly charged John with being an Origenist, and had also uncanonically conferred <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests'</a> orders on Jerome's brother Paulinian, in order that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> might henceforth be entirely independent of John. Naturally, John resented this conduct and showed his resentment. The present letter is a kind of half-apology made by Epiphanius for what he had done, and like all such, it only seems to have made matters worse. The controversy is fully detailed in the treatise <q>Against John of Jerusalem</q> in this volume, esp. &sect;11-14.</p>

<p>An interesting paragraph (&sect;9) narrates how Epiphanius destroyed at Anablatha a church-curtain on which was depicted <q>a likeness of Christ or of some saint</q>&mdash; an early instance of the iconoclastic spirit.</p>

<p>Originally written in Greek, the letter was (by the writer's request) rendered into Latin by Jerome. Its date is 394 A.D.</p>
</div>

<p>To the lord <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and dearly beloved brother, John, Epiphanius sends greeting.</p>

<p>1. It surely becomes us, dearly beloved, not to abuse our rank as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, so as to make it an occasion of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, but by diligently keeping and observing God's commandments, to be in reality what in name we profess to be. For, if the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> say, <q>Their lots shall not profit them,</q>  what <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> in our clerical position  will be able to avail us who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not only in thought and feeling, but in speech? I have heard, of course, that you are incensed against me, that you are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, and that you threaten to write about me&mdash; not merely to particular places and provinces, but to the uttermost ends of the earth. Where is that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God which should make us tremble with the trembling spoken of by the Lord&mdash; <q>Whosoever is <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with his brother without a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall be in danger of the judgment</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note301236"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> Not that I greatly care for your writing what you please. For Isaiah tells us  of letters written on papyrus and cast upon the waters&mdash; missives soon carried away by time and tide. I have done you no harm, I have inflicted no injury upon you, I have extorted nothing from you by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. My action concerned a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> whose inmates were foreigners in no way subject to your provincial jurisdiction. Moreover their regard for my insignificance and for the letters which I frequently addressed to them had commenced to produce a feeling of dislike to communion with you. Feeling, therefore, that too great strictness or scrupulosity on my part might have the effect of alienating them from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with its ancient <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I ordained one of the brothers <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and after he had ministered as such, admitted him to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. You should, I think, have been grateful to me for this, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, as you surely must, that it is the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God which has compelled me to act in this way, and particularly when you recollect that God's <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> is everywhere the same, and that I have simply made provision for the wants of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For, although each individual <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has under him churches which are placed in his charge, and although no man may stretch himself beyond his measure, <span class="stiki" id="note301238"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:14</a></span> yet the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is without dissimulation, <span class="stiki" id="note301239"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse9">Romans&nbsp;12:9</a></span> is set up as an example to us all; and we must consider not so much the thing done as the time and place, the mode and motive, of doing it. I saw that the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> contained a large number of reverend brothers, and that the reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, Jerome and Vincent, through modesty and humility, were unwilling to offer the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> permitted to their rank, and to labor in that part of their calling which ministers more than any other to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, moreover, that you could not find or lay hands on this servant of God  who had several times fled from you simply because he was reluctant to undertake the onerous duties of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and that no other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> could easily find him. Accordingly, I was a good deal surprised when, by the ordering of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he came to me with the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and others of the brethren, to make satisfaction to me for some grievance or other which I had against them. While, therefore, the Collect  was being celebrated in the church of the villa which adjoins our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>&mdash; he being quite <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and wholly unsuspicious of my purpose&mdash; I gave orders to a number of <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to seize him and to stop his mouth, lest in his eagerness to free himself he might <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> me in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. First of all, then, I ordained him <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, setting before him the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and forcing him to minister; for he made a hard struggle against it, crying out that he was unworthy, and protesting that this heavy burden was beyond his strength. It was with difficulty, then, that I overcame his reluctance, persuading him as well as I could with passages from Scripture, and setting before him the commandments  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when he had ministered in the offering of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, once more with great difficulty I closed his mouth and ordained him <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>. Then, using the same arguments as before, I induced him to sit in the place set apart for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>. After this I wrote to the reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and other brothers of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, chiding them for not having written to me about him. For a year before I had heard many of them complain that they had no one to celebrate for them the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the Lord. All then agreed in asking him to undertake the duty, pointing out how great his usefulness would be to the community of the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. I blamed them for omitting to write to me and to propose that I should ordain him, when the opportunity was given to them to do so.</p>

<p>2. All this I have done, as I said just now, relying on that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which you, I feel sure, cherish towards my insignificance; not to mention the fact that I held the ordination in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, and not within the limits of your jurisdiction. How <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed is the mildness and complacency of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of (my own) <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, as well as their simplicity, though to your refinement and discrimination it appears deserving only of God's pity! For many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in communion with me have ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in my province whom I had been unable to capture, and have sent to me <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> and subdeacons  whom I have been glad to receive. I myself, too, have urged the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Philo of blessed memory, and the reverend Theoprepus, to make provision for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by ordaining <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> in those churches of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> which, although they were accounted to belong to my see, happened to be close to them, and this for the reason that my province was large and straggling. But for my part I have never ordained <a href="../cathen/04651a.htm">deaconesses</a> nor sent them into the provinces of others,  nor have I done anything to rend the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Why, then, have you thought fit to be so <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> and indignant with me for that work of God which I have wrought for the edification of the brethren, and not for their destruction? <span class="stiki" id="note301244"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:8</a></span> Moreover, I have been much surprised at the assertion which you have made to my <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, that you sent me a message by that reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, the abbot Gregory, that I was to ordain no one, and that I promised to comply, saying, <q>Am I a stripling, or do I not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the canons?</q> By God's word I am telling you the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when I say that I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and have heard nothing of all this, and that I have not the slightest recollection of using any language of the sort. As, however, I have had misgivings, lest possibly, being only a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I may have forgotten this among so many other matters, I have made inquiry of the reverend Gregory, and of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Zeno, who is with him. Of these, the abbot Gregory replies that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing whatever about the matter, while Zeno says that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Rufinus, in the course of some desultory remarks, spoke these words. <q>Will the reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, think you, venture to ordain any <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>?</q> but that the conversation went no further. I, Epiphanius, however, have never either received the message or answered it. Do not, then, dearly beloved, allow your <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> to overcome you or your indignation to get the better of you, lest you should disquiet yourself in vain; and lest you should be thought to be putting forward this grievance only to get scope for tendencies of another kind,  and thus to have sought out an occasion of sinning. It is to avoid this that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> to the Lord, saying: <q>Turn not aside my heart to words of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, to making excuses for my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> </p>

<p>3. This also I have been surprised to hear, that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of carrying tales backwards and forwards, and of always adding something fresh to what they have heard, to stir up grievances and disputes between brothers, have succeeded in disquieting you by saying that, when I offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I am wont to say this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> on your behalf: <q>Grant, O Lord, to John <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> aright.</q> Do not suppose me so untutored as to be capable of saying this so openly. To tell you the simple <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, my dearest brother, although I continually use this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> mentally, I have never confided it to the ears of others, lest I should seem to dishonor you. But when I repeat the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> required by the ritual of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, then I say on behalf of all and of you as well as others, <q>Guard him, that he may preach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> or at least this, <q>Do Thou, O Lord, grant him Your aid, and guard him, that he may preach the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q> as occasion offers itself for the words, and as the turn comes for the particular <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. Wherefore I beseech you, dearly beloved, and, casting myself down at your feet, I entreat you to grant to me and to yourself this one <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that you would save yourself, as it is written, <q>from an untoward generation.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301247"><a href="../bible/act002.htm#verse40">Acts&nbsp;2:40</a></span> Withdraw, dearly beloved, from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> and from all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. For I see that all your indignation has been roused against me simply because I have told you that you ought not to eulogize one who is the spiritual father of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and the root and parent of all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. And when I appealed to you not to go astray, and warned you of the consequences, you traversed my words, and reduced me to tears and sadness; and not me only, but many other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who were present.  This I take to be the origin of your indignation and of your passion on the present occasion. On this account you threaten to send out letters against me, and to circulate your version of the matter in all directions;  and thus, while with a view to defending your <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> you kindle men's <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> against me, you break through the charity which I have shown towards you, and act with so little discretion that you make me regret that I have held communion with you, and that I have by so doing upheld the erroneous opinions of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>.</p>

<p>4. I speak plainly. To use the language of Scripture, I do not spare to pluck out my own eye if it <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> me to offend, nor to cut off my hand and my foot if they <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> me to do so. <span class="stiki" id="note301250"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;18:8-9</a></span> And you must be treated in the same way whether you are my eyes, or my hands, or my feet. For what <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who adorns his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with good works, can hear with calmness <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> teaching and counsel, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in his extraordinary preaching? <q>The Son,</q> he tells us, <q>cannot see the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> cannot see the Son.</q> These words occur in his book <q>On First Principles;</q> thus we read, and thus <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> has spoken. <q>For as it is unsuitable to say that the Son can see the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, it is consequently unsuitable to suppose that the Spirit can see the Son.</q>  Can any one, moreover, brook <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> assertion that men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> were once <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven, and that having <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> in the upper world, they have been cast down into this, and have been confined in bodies as in barrows or tombs, to pay the penalty for their former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and that the bodies of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are not temples of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,  but prisons of the condemned? Again, he tampers with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> meaning of the narrative by a false use of allegory, multiplying words without limit; and undermines the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the simple by the most varied arguments. Now he maintains that <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, in Greek the <q>cool things,</q> from a word meaning to be cool,  are so called because in coming down from the heavenly places to the lower world they have lost their former heat;  and now, that our bodies are called by the Greeks chains, from a word meaning chain,  or else (on the analogy of our own Latin word) <q>things fallen,</q>  because our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> have fallen from heaven; and that the other word for body which the abundance of the Greek idiom supplies  is by many taken to mean a funeral monument,  because the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is shut up within it in the same way as the corpses of the dead are shut up in tombs and barrows. If this doctrine is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> what becomes of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Where is the preaching of the resurrection? Where is the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, which lasts on to this day in the churches of Christ? Where is the blessing to Adam, and to his seed, and to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> and his sons? <q>Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</q>  According to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, these words must be a curse and not a blessing; for he turns <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> into <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, compelling them to leave the place of highest rank and to come down lower, as though God were unable through the action of His blessing to grant <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, had the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and as though for every birth on earth there must be a fall in heaven. We are to give up, then, the teaching of <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, of the law, and of our Lord and Saviour Himself, in spite of His language loud as thunder in the gospel. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, on the other hand, commands and urges&mdash; not to say binds&mdash; his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> not to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to ascend into heaven, lest sinning once more worse than they had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> on earth they should be hurled down into the world again. Such foolish and insane notions he generally confirms by distorting the sense of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> and making them mean what they do not mean at all. He quotes this passage from the Psalms: <q>Before you <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbled</a> me by reason of my <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, I went wrong;</q>  and this, <q>Return unto your rest, O my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;</q>  this also, <q>Bring my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> out of <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>;</q>  and this, <q>I will make confession unto the Lord in the land of the living,</q>  although there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the meaning of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> is different from the interpretation by which he unfairly wrests it to the support of his own <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. This way of acting is common to the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06592a.htm">Gnostics</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05242c.htm">Ebionites</a>, the Marcionites, and the votaries of the other eighty <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>,  all of whom draw their <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from the pure well of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, not, however, interpreting it in the sense in which it is written, but trying to make the simple language of the Church's writers accord with their own wishes.</p>

<p>5. Of one position which he strives to maintain I hardly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether it calls for my tears or my laughter. This wonderful doctor presumes to teach that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> will once more be what he at one time was, that he will return to his former dignity and rise again to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Oh horror! That a man should be so frantic and foolish as to hold that John the Baptist, Peter, the apostle and <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the rest of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, are made co-heirs of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>! I pass over his idle explanation of the coats of skins,  and say nothing of the efforts and arguments he has used to induce us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that these coats of skins represent <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies. Among many other things, he says this: <q>Was God a tanner or a saddler, that He should prepare the hides of animals, and should stitch from them coats of skins for <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a>?</q> <q>It is clear,</q> he goes on, <q>that he is speaking of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> bodies.</q> If this is so, how is it that before the coats of skins, and the disobedience, and the fall from paradise, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> speaks not in an allegory, but literally, thus: <q>This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301266"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;2:23</a></span> or what is the ground of the divine narrative, <q>And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note301267"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse21">Genesis&nbsp;2:21-22</a></span> for him? Or what bodies can <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> have covered with fig-leaves after eating of the forbidden tree? <span class="stiki" id="note301268"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> Who can patiently listen to the perilous arguments of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> when he denies the resurrection of this flesh, as he most clearly does in his book of explanations of the first psalm and in many other places? Or who can tolerate him when he gives us a paradise in the third heaven, and transfers that which the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> mentions from earth to the heavenly places, and when he explains allegorically all the trees which are mentioned in Genesis, saying in effect that the trees are angelic potencies, a sense which the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> drift of the passage does not admit? For the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> has not said, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> put down <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> upon the earth,</q> but <q>He drove them out of the paradise, and made them dwell over against the paradise.</q>  He does not say <q>under the paradise.</q> <q>He placed...cherubims and a flaming sword...to keep the way of  the tree of life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301271"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;3:24</a></span> He says nothing about an ascent to it. <q>And a river went out of <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301272"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;2:10</a></span> He does not say <q>went down from <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a>.</q> <q>It was parted and became into four heads. The name of the first is Pison...and the name of the second is Gihon.</q>  I myself have seen the waters of Gihon, have seen them with my bodily eyes. It is this Gihon to which Jeremiah points when he says, <q>What have you to do in the way of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> to drink the muddy water of Gihon?</q>  I have drunk also from the great river Euphrates, not spiritual but actual water, such as you can touch with your hand and imbibe with your mouth. But where there are rivers which admit of being seen and of being drunk, it follows that there also there will be fig-trees and other trees; and it is of these that the Lord says, <q>Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301275"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse16">Genesis&nbsp;2:16</a></span> They are like other trees and timber, just as the rivers are like other rivers and waters. But if the water is visible and real, then the fig-tree and the rest of the timber must be real also, and <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and <a href="../cathen/05646b.htm">Eve</a> must have been originally formed with real and not phantasmal bodies, and not, as <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> would have us <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, have afterwards received them on account of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But, you say, <q>we read that Saint <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was caught up to the third heaven, into paradise.</q>  You explain the words rightly: <q>When he mentions the third heaven, and then adds the word paradise, he shows that heaven is in one place and paradise in another.</q> Must not every one reject and despise such special pleading as that by which <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> says of the waters that are above the firmament  that they are not waters, but heroic beings of angelic power,  and again of the waters that are over the earth&mdash; that is, below the firmament&mdash; that they are potencies  of the contrary sort&mdash; that is, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>? If so, why do we read in the account of the deluge that the windows of heaven were opened, and that the waters of the deluge prevailed? In consequence of which the fountains of the deep were opened, and the whole earth was covered with the waters. <span class="stiki" id="note301280"><a href="../bible/gen007.htm#verse11">Genesis&nbsp;7:11</a></span> </p>

<p>6. Oh! The <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and folly of those who have forsaken the teaching of the book of Proverbs, <q>My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301281"><a href="../bible/pro006.htm#verse20">Proverbs&nbsp;6:20</a></span> and have turned to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and say to the fool that he shall be their leader, and do not despise the foolish things which are said by the foolish man, even as the scripture bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, <q>The foolish man speaks foolishly, and his heart understands vanity.</q>  I beseech you, dearly beloved, and by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which I feel towards you, I implore you&mdash; as though it were my own members on which I would have pity &mdash; by word and letter to fulfil that which is written, <q>Do not I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> them, O Lord, that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> you? And am not I grieved with those that rise up against you?</q>  <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> words are the words of an enemy, hateful and repugnant to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; and not only those which I have quoted, but countless others. For it is not now my intention to argue against all his opinions. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> has not lived in my day, nor has he <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbed</a> me. I have not conceived a dislike to him nor quarrelled with him because of an inheritance or of any worldly matter; but&mdash; to speak plainly&mdash; I grieve, and grieve bitterly, to see numbers of my brothers, and of those in particular who show the most promise, and have reached the highest rank in the sacred ministry,  deceived by his persuasive arguments, and made by his most perverse teaching the food of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, whereby the saying is fulfilled: <q>He derides every stronghold, and his fare is choice, and he has gathered captives as the sand.</q>  But may God free you, my brother, and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people of Christ which is entrusted to you, and all the brothers who are with you, and especially the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Rufinus, from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and other <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and from the perdition to which they lead. For, if for one word or for two opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> many <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have been rejected by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, how much more shall he be held a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> who has contrived such perverse interpretations and such mischievous doctrines to destroy the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and has in fact declared himself the enemy of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>! For, among other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> things, he has presumed to say this, too, that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> lost the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, although Scripture nowhere declares that he did. Were it so, never would all the creatures in the world be subject to Adam's seed&mdash; that is, to the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>; yet, in the words of the apostle, everything <q>is tamed and has been tamed of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301287"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse7">James&nbsp;3:7</a></span> For never would all things be subjected to men if men had not&mdash; together with their authority over all&mdash; the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> conjoins and associates with this the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the blessing which was conferred upon <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> and upon the generations which descended from him. No one can by twisting the meaning of words presume to say that this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God was given to one only, and that he alone was made in the image of God (he and his wife, that is, for while he was formed of clay she was made of one of his ribs), but that those who were subsequently conceived in the womb and not born as was <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> did not possess God's image, for the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> immediately subjoins the following statement: <q>And <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> lived two hundred and thirty years,  and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Eve his wife, and she bare him a son in his image and after his likeness, and called his name Seth.</q>  And again, in the tenth generation, two thousand two hundred and forty-two years afterwards,  <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to vindicate His own image and to show that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which He had given to men still continued in them, gives the following commandment: <q>Flesh...with the blood thereof shall you not eat. And surely your blood will I require at the hand of every man that sheds it; for in the image of God have I made man.</q>  From <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> ten generations passed away, <span class="stiki" id="note301292"><a href="../bible/gen011.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;11:10-26</a></span> and from <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> time to David's, fourteen more, <span class="stiki" id="note301293"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;1:17</a></span> and these twenty-four generations make up, taken together, two thousand one hundred and seventeen years.  Yet the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the thirty-ninth  psalm, while lamenting that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> walk in a vain show, and that they are subject to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, speaks thus: <q>For all that every man walks  in the image.</q>  Also after David's time, in the reign of Solomon his son, we read a somewhat similar reference to the divine likeness. For in the book of Wisdom, which is inscribed with his name, Solomon says: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> created man to be <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, and made him to be an image of His own <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301297"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse23">Wisdom&nbsp;2:23</a></span> And again, about eleven hundred and eleven years afterwards, we read in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> that men have not lost the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For James, an apostle and <a href="../cathen/02767a.htm">brother of the Lord</a>, whom I have mentioned above&mdash; that we may not be entangled in the snares of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>&mdash; teaches us that man does possess God's image and likeness. For, after a somewhat discursive account of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tongue, he has gone on to say of it: <q>It is an unruly evil...therewith bless we <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even the Father and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301298"><a href="../bible/jam003.htm#verse8">James&nbsp;3:8-9</a></span> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, too, the <q>chosen vessel,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301299"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;9:15</a></span> who in his preaching has fully maintained the doctrine of the gospel, instructs us that man is made in the image and after the likeness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <q>A man,</q> he says, <q>ought not to wear long hair, forasmuch as he is the image and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301300"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:7</a></span> He speaks of <q>the image</q> simply, but explains the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the likeness by the word <q><a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</q></p>

<p>7. Instead of the three <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> which you said would satisfy you if I could produce them, behold I have given you seven. Who, then, will put up with the follies of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>? I will not use a severer word and so make myself like him or his followers, who presume at the peril of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to assert dogmatically whatever first comes into their head, and to dictate to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whereas they ought either to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to Him or to learn the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from Him. For some of them say that the image of God which <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> had previously received was lost when he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>. Others surmise that the body which the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> was destined to take of Mary was the image of the Creator. Some identify this image with the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, others with sensation, others with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. These make it <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, those assert that it is in virtue of God's image that man exercises universal sway. Like drunkards in their cups, they ejaculate now this, now that, when they ought rather to have avoided so serious a risk, and to have obtained <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by simple <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, not denying the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To God they ought to have left the sure and exact <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of His own gift, and of the particular way in which He has created men in His image and after His likeness. Forsaking this course, they have involved themselves in many subtle questions, and through these they have been plunged into the mire of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But we, dearly beloved, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the words of the Lord, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that God's image remains in all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and we leave it to Him to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in what respect man is created in His image. And let no one be deceived by that passage in the epistle of John, which some readers fail to understand, where he says: <q>Now are we the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, when He shall appear, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301301"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> For this refers to the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is then to be revealed <span class="stiki" id="note301302"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:1</a></span> to His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; just as also in another place we read the words <q>from <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301303"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse18">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:18</a></span> of which <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have even in this world received an earnest and a small portion. At their head stands <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, whose face shone exceedingly, and was bright with the brightness of the sun.  Next to him comes Elijah, who was caught up into heaven in a chariot of fire, <span class="stiki" id="note301305"><a href="../bible/2ki002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;2:11</a></span> and did not feel the effects of the flame. Stephen, too, when he was being <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, had the face of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> visible to all. <span class="stiki" id="note301306"><a href="../bible/act006.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;6:15</a></span> And this which we have verified in a few cases is to be understood of all, that what is written may be fulfilled. <q>Every one that sanctifies himself shall be numbered among the blessed.</q> For, <q>blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301307"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> </p>

<p>8. These things being so, dearly beloved, keep watch over your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and cease to murmur against me. For the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a> says: <q>Neither murmur ye [one against another ] as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of serpents.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301309"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:10</a></span> Rather give way to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> both you and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And may the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of peace, according to His mercy, grant to us that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> may be bruised under the feet of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note301310"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;16:20</a></span> and that every occasion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> may be shunned, so that the bond of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and peace may not be rent asunder between us, or the preaching of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a> be anywise hindered.</p>

<p>9. Moreover, I have heard that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have this grievance against me: When I accompanied you to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place called Bethel, there to join you in celebrating the Collect,  after the use of the Church, I came to a villa called Anablatha and, as I was passing, saw a lamp burning there. Asking what place it was, and learning it to be a church, I went in to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and found there a curtain hanging on the doors of the said church, dyed and embroidered.  It bore an image either of Christ or of one of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; I do not rightly remember whose the image was. Seeing this, and being loth that an image of a man should be hung up in Christ's church contrary to the teaching of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, I tore it asunder and advised the custodians of the place to use it as a winding sheet for some poor person. They, however, murmured, and said that if I made up my mind to tear it, it was only fair that I should give them another curtain in its place. As soon as I heard this, I promised that I would give one, and said that I would send it at once. Since then there has been some little delay, due to the fact that I have been seeking a curtain of the best quality to give to them instead of the former one, and thought it right to send to <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> for one. I have now sent the best that I could find, and I beg that you will order the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the place to take the curtain which I have sent from the hands of the Reader, and that you will afterwards give directions that curtains of the other sort&mdash; opposed as they are to our religion&mdash; shall not be hung up in any church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. A man of your uprightness should be careful to remove an occasion of offense  unworthy alike of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> and of those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who are committed to your charge. Beware of Palladius of Galatia&mdash; a man once dear to me, but who now sorely needs God's pity&mdash; for he preaches and teaches the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; and see to it that he does not seduce any of those who are entrusted to your keeping into the perverse ways of his erroneous doctrine.
