<h1>Letter 51</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Bishop Bosporius</em>. </p>

<p>How do you think my heart was pained at hearing of the <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanders</a> heaped on me by some of those that feel no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Judge, who <q>shall destroy them that speak leasing</q>?  I spent nearly the whole night sleepless, thinking of your words of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; so did grief lay hold upon my heart of hearts. For verily, in the words of Solomon, <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>.  And no man is so void of feeling as not to be touched at heart, and bowed down to the ground, if he falls in with lips prone to lying. But we must needs put up with all things and endure all things, after committing our vindication to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. He will not despise us; for <q>he that oppresses the poor reproaches his Maker.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322179"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse31">Proverbs&nbsp;14:31</a></span> They, however, who have patched up this new tragedy of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> seem to have lost all belief in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, Who has declared that we must give account at the day of judgment even for an idle word. <span class="stiki" id="note322180"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;12:36</a></span> And I, tell me, I <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> the right blessed Dianius? For this is what they have said against me. Where? When? In whose presence? On what pretext? In mere spoken words, or in writing? Following others, or myself the author and originator of the deed? Alas for the impudence of men who make no difficulty at saying anything! Alas for their contempt of the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a>! Unless, indeed, they add this further to their fiction, that they make me out to have been once upon a time so far out of my mind as not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I was saying. For so long as I have been in my senses I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I never did anything of the kind, or had the least wish to do so. What I am, indeed, conscious of is this; that from my earliest childhood I was brought up in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for him, thought as I gazed at him how venerable he looked, how dignified, how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> reverend. Then when I grew older I began to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him by the good qualities of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and took delight in his society, gradually learning to perceive the simplicity, nobility, and liberality of his character, and all his most distinctive qualities, his gentleness of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, his mingled magnanimity and meekness, the seemliness of his conduct, his control of temper, the beaming cheerfulness and affability which he combined with majesty of demeanour. From all this I counted him among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> most illustrious for high character.</p>

<p>However, towards the close of his life (I will not conceal the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>) I, together with many of them that in our country  feared the Lord, sorrowed over him with sorrow unendurable, because he signed the creed brought from Constantinople by George.  Afterwards, full of kindness and gentleness as he was, and willing out of the fullness of his fatherly heart to give satisfaction to everyone, when he had already fallen sick of the disease of which he died, he sent for me, and, calling the Lord to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, said that in the simplicity of his heart he had agreed to the document sent from Constantinople, but had had no idea of rejecting the creed put forth by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers at Nic&aelig;a, nor had had any other disposition of heart than from the beginning he had always had. He <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, moreover, that he might not be cut off from the lot of those blessed three hundred and eighteen <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who had announced the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> decree  to the world. In consequence of this satisfactory statement I dismissed all anxiety and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, and, as you are aware, communicated with him, and gave over grieving. Such have been my relations with Dianius. If anyone avers that he is privy to any vile <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> on my part against Dianius, do not let him buzz it slave-wise in a corner; let him come boldly out and convict me in the light of day.</p>
