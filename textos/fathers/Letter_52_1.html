<h1>Letter 52</h1>

<p> <em>First Letter to Monks.  (Written 358-360).</em></p>

<p>1. To those in every place  who are living a monastic life, who are established in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and sanctified in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and who say, 'Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed You <span class="stiki" id="note284643"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;19:27</a></span>,' brethren dearly beloved and longed for, heartiest greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>1. In compliance with your affectionate request, which you have frequently urged upon me, I have written a short account of the sufferings which ourselves and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have undergone, refuting, according to my ability, the accursed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> madmen, and proving how entirely it is alien from the Truth. And I thought it needful to represent to your Piety what pains the writing of these things has cost me, in order that you may understand thereby how <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the blessed Apostle has said, 'O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of God <span class="stiki" id="note284644"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse33">Romans&nbsp;11:33</a></span>;' and may kindly bear with a weak man such as I am by nature. For the more I desired to write, and endeavoured to force myself to understand the Divinity of the Word, so much the more did the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> thereof withdraw itself from me; and in proportion as I thought that I apprehended it, in so much I perceived myself to fail of doing so. Moreover also I was unable to express in writing even what I seemed to myself to understand; and that which I wrote was unequal to the imperfect shadow of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in my conception.</p>

<p>2. Considering therefore how it is written in the Book of Ecclesiastes, 'I said, I will be wise, but it was far from me; That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who shall find it out?' <span class="stiki" id="note284645"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse23">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:23-24</a></span> and what is said in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, 'The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of You is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it ;' and that Solomon says, 'It is the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of God to conceal a thing <span class="stiki" id="note284647"><a href="../bible/pro025.htm#verse2">Proverbs&nbsp;25:2</a></span>;' I frequently designed to stop and to cease writing; <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, I did. But lest I should be found to disappoint you, or by my silence to lead into impiety those who have made enquiry of you, and are given to disputation, I constrained myself to write briefly, what I have now sent  to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. For although a perfect apprehension of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is at present far removed from us by reason of the infirmity of the flesh, yet it is possible, as the Preacher himself has said, to perceive the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of the impious, and having found it, to say that it is 'more bitter than death <span class="stiki" id="note284649"><a href="../bible/ecc007.htm#verse26">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;7:26</a></span>.' Wherefore for this reason, as perceiving this and able to find it out, I have written, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that to the faithful the detection of impiety is a sufficient information wherein <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> consists. For although it be impossible to comprehend what God is, yet it is possible to say what He is not.  And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He is not as man; and that it is not lawful to conceive of any originated nature as existing in Him. So also respecting the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, although we are by nature very far from being able to comprehend Him; yet is it possible and easy to condemn the assertions of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> concerning Him, and to say, that the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is not such; nor is it lawful even to conceive in our minds such things as they speak, concerning His Godhead; much less to utter them with the lips.</p>

<p>3. Accordingly I have written as well as I was able; and you, dearly beloved, receive these communications not as containing a perfect exposition of the Godhead of the Word, but as being merely a refutation of the impiety of the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and as containing and affording to those who desire it, suggestions for arriving at a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And if in anything they are defective (and I think they are defective in all respects), pardon it with a pure <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and only receive favourably the boldness of my good intentions in support of godliness. For an utter condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, it is sufficient for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the judgment given by the Lord in the death of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, of which you have already been informed by others. 'For what the Holy God has purposed, who shall scatter <span class="stiki" id="note284651"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse27">Isaiah&nbsp;14:27</a></span>?' and whom the Lord condemned who shall justify ? After such a sign given, who do not now acknowledge, that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, however it may have men for its patrons? Now when you have read this account, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me, and exhort one another so to do. And immediately send it back to me, and suffer no one whatever to take a copy of it, nor transcribe it for yourselves.  But like good money-changers  be satisfied with the reading; but read it repeatedly if you desire to do so. For it is not safe that the writings of us babblers and private <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should fall into the hands of them that shall come after. Salute one another in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and also all that come unto you in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For 'if any man' as the Apostle has said, '<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not the Lord, let him be <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> be with you. <span class="stiki" id="note284655"><a href="../bible/1co016.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;16:22-23</a></span> <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.'</p>
