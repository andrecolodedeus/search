<h1>Letter 52</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To the Canonic&aelig;</em>. </p>

<p>1. I have been very much distressed by a painful report which reached my ears; but I have been equally delighted by my brother, beloved of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Bosporius,  who has brought a more satisfactory account of you. He avers by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that all those stories spread abroad about you are inventions of men who are not exactly informed as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about you. He added, moreover, that he found among you impious <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> about me, of a kind likely to be uttered by those who do not expect to have to give the Judge in the day of His righteous retribution an account of even an idle word. I thank <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, then, both because I am cured of my damaging opinion of you, an opinion which I have derived from the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and because I have heard of your abandonment of those baseless notions about me, on hearing the assurances of my brother. He, in all that he has said as coming from himself, has also completely expressed my own feeling. For in us both there is one mind about the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as being heirs of the same Fathers who once at Nic&aelig;a promulgated their great decree  concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Of this, some portions are universally accepted without cavil, but the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a>, ill received in certain quarters, is still rejected by some. These objectors we may very properly blame, and yet on the contrary deem them deserving of pardon. To refuse to follow the Fathers, not holding their declaration of more authority than one's own opinion, is conduct worthy of blame, as being brimful of self-sufficiency. On the other hand the fact that they view with suspicion a phrase which is misrepresented by an opposite party does seem to a small extent to relieve them from blame. Moreover, as a matter of fact, the members of the synods which met to discuss the case of <a href="../cathen/11589a.htm">Paul of Samosata</a>  did find fault with the term as an unfortunate one.</p>

<p>For they maintained that the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a> set forth the idea both of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and of what is derived from it, so that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, when divided, confers the title of co-essential on the parts into which it is divided. This explanation has some reason in the case of bronze and coins made therefrom, but in the case of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and God the Son there is no question of substance anterior or even underlying both; the mere thought and utterance of such a thing is the last extravagance of impiety. What can be conceived of as anterior to the Unbegotten? By this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a> is destroyed, for things, constituted out of one, have to one another the relation of brothers.</p>

<p>2. Because even at that time there were men who asserted the Son to have been brought into being out of the non-existent, the term <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a> was adopted, to extirpate this impiety. For the conjunction of the Son with the Father is without time and without interval. The preceding words show this to have been the intended meaning. For after saying that the Son was light of light, and begotten of the substance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but was not made, they went on to add the <a href="../cathen/07449a.htm">homoousion</a>, thereby showing that whatever proportion of light any one would attribute in the case of the Father will obtain also in that of the Son. For very light in relation to very light, according to the actual sense of light, will have no variation. Since then the Father is light without beginning, and the Son begotten light, but each of Them light and light; they rightly said <q>of one substance,</q> in order to set forth the equal dignity of the nature. Things, that have a relation of brotherhood, are not, as some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have supposed, of one substance; but when both the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and that which derives its natural <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> are of the same nature, then they are called <q>of one substance.</q></p>

<p>3. This term also corrects the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Sabellius, for it removes the idea of the identity of the hypostases, and introduces in perfection the idea of the Persons. For nothing can be of one substance with itself, but one thing is of one substance with another. The word has therefore an excellent and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> use, defining as it does both the proper character of the hypostases, and setting forth the invariability of the nature. And when we are taught that the Son is of the substance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, begotten and not made, let us not fall into the material sense of the relations. For the substance was not separated from the Father and bestowed on the Son; neither did the substance engender by fluxion, nor yet by shooting forth  as plants their fruits. The mode of the divine begetting is ineffable and inconceivable by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thought. It is indeed characteristic of poor and carnal intelligence to compare the things that are <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> with the perishing things of time, and to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, that as corporeal things beget, so does God in like manner; it is rather our duty to rise to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by arguments of the contrary, and to say, that since thus is the mortal, not thus is He who is <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>. We must neither then deny the divine generation, nor contaminate our intelligence with corporeal senses.</p>

<p>4. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, too, is numbered with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, because He is above creation, and is ranked as we are taught by the words of the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, <q>Go and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322190"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> He who, on the contrary, places the Spirit before the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or alleges Him to be older than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, resists the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is a stranger to the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since he fails to preserve the form of doxology which he has received, but adopts some new fangled device in order to be pleasing to men. It is written <q>The Spirit is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322191"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:12</a></span> and if He is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how can He be older than that of which He is? And what folly is it not, when there is one Unbegotten, to speak of something else as superior to the Unbegotten? He is not even anterior, for nothing intervenes between Son and Father. If, however, He is not of God but is through Christ, He does not even exist at all. It follows, that this new invention about the order really involves the destruction of the actual <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and is a denial of the whole <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. It is equally impious to reduce Him to the level of a creature, and to subordinate Him either to Son or to Father, either in time or in rank. These are the points on which I have heard that you are making enquiry. If the Lord grant that we meet I may possibly have more to say on these subjects, and may myself, concerning points which I am investigating, receive satisfactory information from you.</p>
