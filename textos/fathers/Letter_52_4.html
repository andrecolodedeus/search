<h1>Letter 52</h1>

<p> <em>From Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrus, to Leo. (See vol. iii. of this Series, p. 293.)</em></p>

<h2>I. If Paul appealed to Peter how much more must ordinary folk have recourse to his successor.</h2>

<p>To Leo, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>.</p>

<p>If <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the herald of the Truth, the trumpet of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, had recourse to the great Peter, in order to obtain a decision from him for those at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> who were disputing about living by the Law, much more do we small and <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> folk run to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> to get healing from you for the sores of the churches. For it is fitting that you should in all things have the pre-eminence, seeing that your See possesses many peculiar privileges. For other cities get a name for size or beauty or population, and some that are devoid of these advantages are compensated by certain spiritual gifts: but your city has the fullest abundance of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things from the Giver of all good. For she is of all cities the greatest and most famous, the mistress of the world and teeming with population. And besides this she has created an empire which is still predominant and has imposed her own name upon her subjects. But her chief decoration is her Faith, to which the Divine Apostle is a sure <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> when he exclaims <q>your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is proclaimed in all the world <span class="stiki" id="note360375"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;1:8</a></span>;</q> and if immediately after receiving the seeds of the saving <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> she bore such a weight of wondrous fruit, what words are sufficient to express the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> which is now found in her? She has, too, the tombs of our common fathers and teachers of the Truth, Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> , to illumine the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>. And this blessed and divine pair arose indeed in the East, and shed its rays in all directions, but voluntarily underwent the sunset of life in the West, from whence now it illumines the whole world. These have rendered your See so <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a>: this is the chief of all your goods. And their See is still blest by the light of their God's presence, seeing that therein He has placed your Holiness to shed abroad the rays of the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Faith.</p>

<h2>II. He commends Leo's zeal against the Manichees, and latterly against Eutychianism, as evidenced especially in the Tome.</h2>

<p>Of which thing indeed, though there are many other <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> to be found, your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> against the ill-famed <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> enough, that <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> which your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has of late years displayed , thereby revealing the intensity of your devotion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in things Divine. Proof enough, too, of your Apostolic character is what you have now written. For we have met with what your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has written about the Incarnation of our God and Saviour, and have admired the careful diligence of the work.  For it has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> both points equally well, viz., the Eternal Godhead of the Only-begotten of the Eternal Father, and at the same time His manhood of the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and David, and His assumption of a nature in all things like ours, except in this one thing, that He remained free from all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is engendered not of nature, but of <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>.  This also was contained in your letter, that the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> is One and His Godhead impassible, irreversible, unchangeable even as the Father who begot Him and the All-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit. And since the Divine nature could not suffer, He took the nature that could suffer to this end, that by the suffering of His own Flesh He might give exemption from suffering to those that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on Him. These points, and all that is akin thereto, the letter contained. And we, admiring your spiritual wisdom, extolled the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which spoke through you, and ask and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, and beg and beseech your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to come to the rescue of the churches of God that are now tempest tossed.</p>

<h2>III. He complains of Dioscorus' ill-treatment of himself.</h2>

<p>For when we expected a stilling of the waves through those who were sent to <a href="../cathen/05490a.htm">Ephesus</a> from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, we have fallen into yet worse storm. For the most righteous  prelate of Alexandria was not satisfied with the illegal and most unrighteous deposition of the Lord's most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and God-loving <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, Flavian, nor was his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> appeased by the slaughter of the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> likewise. But me, too, he murdered with his pen in my absence, without calling me to judgment, without passing judgment on me in person, without questioning me on what I hold about the Incarnation of our God and Saviour. But even murderers, tomb-breakers, and ravishers of other men's beds, those who sit in judgment do not condemn until they either themselves corroborate the accusations by their confessions, or are clearly convicted by others. But us, when five and thirty days' journey distant, he, though brought up on Divine <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, has condemned at his will. And not now only has he done this, but also last year, after that two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> infected with the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> disorder had come hither and laid false information against us, he rose up in church and <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematized</a> us, and that when I had written to him and expressed what I hold in a letter.</p>

<h2>IV. This ill-treatment has come after 20 years' good work in his diocese of Cyrus.</h2>

<p>I bemoan the distress of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and yearn after its peace. For having ruled through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> the church committed to me by the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> for 20 years, neither in the time of the blessed Theodotus, president of the East, nor in the time of those who have succeeded him in the See of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, have I received the slightest blame, but, the Divine Grace working with me, have freed more than 1,000 <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> from the disease of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and have won over many others from the company of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and Eunomius to the Master, Christ. And 800 churches have I had to shepherd: for that is the number of parishes in Cyrus, in which not a single tare through your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> has lingered. But our flock has been freed from every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. He that sees all things <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> how I have been <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> by the ill-famed <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> that have been sent against me, and what struggles I have had in many cities of the East against Greeks, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and every <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. And after all these toils and troubles, I have been condemned without a hearing.</p>

<h2>V. He appeals to the Apostolic See with confidence.</h2>

<p>I however await the verdict of your <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and beg and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> your Holiness to succour me when I appeal to your upright and just tribunal, and bid me come to you and show that my teaching follows in the track of the Apostles. For there are writings of mine some 20 years ago, some 18, some 15, and some 12, some again against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and Eunomians, some against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and Greeks some against the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> in <a href="../cathen/11712a.htm">Persia</a>, some also about the universal Providence, others about the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and about the Divine Incarnation. I have interpreted, through the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, both the Apostolic writings and the prophetic utterances, and it is easy therefrom to gather whether I have kept unswervingly the standard of the Faith, or have turned aside from its straight path. And I beg you not to spurn my petition, nor to overlook the insults heaped on my poor white hairs.</p>

<h2>VI. Ought he to acquiesce in his deposition?</h2>

<p>First of all, I beg you to tell me, whether I ought to acquiesce in this unrighteous deposition or not. For I await your verdict and, if you bid me abide by my condemnation, I will abide by it, and will trouble no one hereafter, but await the unerring verdict of our God and Saviour. I indeed, the Master God is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, care nought for <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but only for the stumbling-block that is put in men's way: because many of the simpler folk, and especially those who have been rescued by us from various <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, will give credence to those who have condemned us, and perchance reckon us <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, not being able to discern the exact <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the dogma, and because, after my long <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, I have acquired neither house, nor land, nor obol, nor tomb, only a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> poverty, having straightway distributed even what came to me from my fathers after their death, as all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who live in the East.</p>

<h2>VII. Being prevented himself, he has sent delegates to plead his cause.</h2>

<p>And before all things I entreat you, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and God-loved brother, render assistance to my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>. These things I have brought to your Holiness' <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, by the most religious and God-beloved <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, Hypatius and Abramius the <a href="../cathen/16024c.htm">chorepiscopi</a> , and Alypius, superintendent  of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in our district: seeing that I was hindered from coming to you myself by the Emperor's restraining letter, and likewise the others. And I entreat your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> both to look on them with fatherly regard, and to lend them your ears in sincere kindness, and also to deem my <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slandered</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> attacked position worthy of your protection, and above all to defend with all your might the Faith that is now plotted against, and to keep the heritage of the fathers intact for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, so shall your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> receive from the Bountiful Master a full reward. (Date about the end of 449.)</p>
