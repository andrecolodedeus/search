<h1>Letter 53</h1>

<p> <em>Second Letter  to Monks.</em></p>

<p>Athanasius, Archbishop  of Alexandria, to the Solitaries.</p>

<p>Athanasius to those who practise a solitary life, and are settled in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, most beloved brethren, greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>I thank the Lord who has given to you to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in Him, that you too may have with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. But because there are certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who hold with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and go about the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> with no other object save that under colour of visiting you, and returning from us they may deceive the simple; whereas there are certain who, while they affirm that they do not hold with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, yet compromise themselves and worship with his party; I have been compelled, at the instance of certain most sincere brethren, to write at once in order that keeping faithfully and without guile the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> works in you, you may not give occasion of scandal to the brethren. For when any sees you, the faithful in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, associate and communicate with such people, [or worshipping along with them], certainly they will think it a matter of indifference and will fall into the mire of irreligion. Lest, then, this should happen, be pleased, beloved, to shun those who hold the impiety [of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>], and moreover to avoid those who, while they pretend not to hold with <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, yet worship with the impious. And we are specially bound to fly from the communion of men whose opinions we hold in execration. [If then any come to you, and, as blessed John <span class="stiki" id="note284658"><a href="../bible/2jo001.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;John&nbsp;10</a></span> says, brings with him right doctrine, say to him, All hail, and receive such an one as a brother.] But if any pretend that he confesses the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, but appear to communicate with those others, exhort him to abstain from such communion, and if he promise to do so, treat him as a brother, but if he persist in a contentious spirit, him avoid. [I might greatly lengthen my letter, adding from the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> the outline of this teaching. But since, being wise men, you can anticipate those who write, and rather, being intent upon self-denial, are fit to instruct others also, I have dictated a short letter, as from one loving friend to others, in the confidence] that living as you do you will preserve a pure and sincere <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and that those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, seeing that you do not join with them in worship, will derive benefit, fearing lest they be accounted as impious, and as those who hold with them.</p>
