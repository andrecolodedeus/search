<h1>Letter 53</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To the Chorepiscopi</em>. </p>

<p>1. My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is deeply pained at the enormity of the matter on which I write, if for this only, that it has caused general suspicion and talk. But so far it has seemed to me incredible. I hope then that what I am writing about it may be taken by the guilty as medicine, by the innocent as a warning, by the indifferent, in which class I trust none of you may be found, as a testimony. And what is it of which I speak? There is a report that some of you take money from candidates for ordination,  and excuse it on grounds of religion. This is indeed worse. If any one does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> under the guise of good he deserves double punishment; because he not only does what is in itself not good, but, so to say, makes good an accomplice in the commission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If the allegation be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, let it be so no more. Let a better state of things begin. To the recipient of the <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> it must be said, as was said by the Apostles to him who was willing to give money to buy the fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, Your money perish with you. <span class="stiki" id="note322195"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse20">Acts&nbsp;8:20</a></span> It is a lighter <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to wish in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to buy, than it is to sell, the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A sale it was; and if you sell what you received as a free gift you will be deprived of the boon, as though you were yourself sold to <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. You are obtruding the traffic of the huckster into spiritual things and into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> where we are entrusted with the body and blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. These things must not be. And I will mention wherein lies an ingenious contrivance. They think that there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because they take the money not before but after the ordination; but to take is to take at whatever time.</p>

<p>2. I exhort you, then, abandon this gain, or, I would rather say, this approach to Hell. Do not, by defiling your hands with such <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribes</a>, render yourselves unfit to celebrate <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>. But forgive me. I began by discrediting; and now I am threatening as though I were convinced. If, after this letter of mine, any one do anything of the kind, he will depart from the altars here and will seek a place where he is able to buy and to sell God's gift. We and the Churches of God have no such custom.  One word more, and I have done. These things come of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>. Now <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and is called <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.  Do not then price <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> above Christ for the sake of a little money. Do not imitate Judas and once more betray for a <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribe</a> Him who was crucified for us. For alike the lands and the hands of all that make such gain shall be called Aceldama. </p>
