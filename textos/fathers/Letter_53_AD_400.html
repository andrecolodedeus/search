<h1>Letter 53 (A.D. 400)</h1>

<p> <em>To Generosus, Our Most Loved and Honourable Brother, Fortunatus, Alypius, and Augustine Send Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. Since you were pleased to acquaint us with the letter sent to you by a <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, although, with the spirit of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, you regarded it with contempt, nevertheless, to aid you in seeking his welfare if his folly be not incurable, we beg you to forward to him the following reply. He wrote that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had enjoined him to declare to you the episcopal succession  of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of your town; to you, forsooth, who hold the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> not of your own town only, nor of Africa only, but of the whole world, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> which has been published, and is now published to all nations. This proves that they think it a small matter that they themselves are not ashamed of being cut off, and are taking no measures, while they may, to be engrafted anew; they are not content unless they do their utmost to cut others off, and bring them to share their own <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, as withered branches fit for the flames. Wherefore, even if you had yourself been visited by that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> whom he affirms to have appeared to him&mdash;a statement which we regard as a cunning fiction; and if the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> had said to you the very words which he, on the warrant of the alleged command, repeated to you&mdash;even in that case it would have been your duty to remember the words of the apostle: <q>Though we, or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111707"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;1:8</a></span> For to you it was proclaimed by the voice of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> Himself, that His <q>gospel shall be preached unto all nations, and then shall the end come.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111708"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;24:14</a></span> To you it has moreover been proclaimed by the writings of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that the promises were given to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> and to his seed, which is Christ, <span class="stiki" id="note111709"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse16">Galatians&nbsp;3:16</a></span> when God said unto him: <q>In your seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed.</q> Having then such promises, if an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven were to say to you, <q>Let go the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> of the whole earth, and cling to the faction of Donatus, the episcopal succession of which is set forth in a letter of their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in your town,</q> he ought to be accursed in your estimation; because he would be endeavouring to cut you off from the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and thrust you into a small party, and make you forfeit your interest in the promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. For if the lineal succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> is to be taken into account, with how much more certainty and benefit to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> do we reckon back till we reach Peter himself, to whom, as bearing in a figure the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,  the Lord said: <q>Upon this rock will I build my Church, and the gates of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> shall not prevail against it!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111711"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> The successor of Peter was Linus, and his successors in unbroken continuity were these:&mdash; Clement, Anacletus, Evaristus, Alexander, Sixtus, <a href="../cathen/14477b.htm">Telesphorus</a>, <a href="../cathen/07593a.htm">Iginus</a>, <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>, <a href="../cathen/12126b.htm">Pius</a>, <a href="../cathen/03144c.htm">Soter</a>, <a href="../cathen/05378a.htm">Eleutherius</a>, Victor, Zephirinus, Calixtus, Urbanus, Pontianus, Antherus, Fabianus, Cornelius, Lucius, Stephanus, Xystus, Dionysius, Felix, Eutychianus, Gaius, Marcellinus, Marcellus, Eusebius, Miltiades, Sylvester, Marcus, Julius, Liberius, Damasus, and <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Siricius</a>, whose successor is the present Bishop Anastasius. In this order of succession no <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is found. But, reversing the natural course of things, the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> from Africa an ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, who, putting himself at the head of a few Africans in the great metropolis, gave some notoriety to the name of <q>mountain men,</q> or Cutzupits, by which they were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>.</p>

<p>3. Now, even although some traditor had in the course of these centuries, through inadvertence, obtained a place in that order of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, reaching from Peter himself to Anastasius, who now occupies that see&mdash;this fact would do no harm to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> having no share in the guilt of another; for the Lord, providing against such a case, says, concerning officers in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>: <q>All whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111712"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;23:3</a></span> Thus the stability of the hope of the faithful is secured, inasmuch as being fixed, not in man, but in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, it never can be swept away by the raging of impious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; whereas they themselves are swept away who read in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> the names of churches to which the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> wrote, and in which they have no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. For what could more clearly prove their perversity and their folly, than their saying to their <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, when they read these letters, <q>Peace be with you,</q>  at the very time that they are themselves disjoined from the peace of those churches to which the letters were originally written?</p> 

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>4. Lest, however, he should congratulate himself too much on the succession of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in Constantina, your own city, read to him the records of proceedings before Munatius Felix, the resident Flamen [<a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>], who was governor of your city in the consulship of <a href="../cathen/05007b.htm">Diocletian</a> for the eighth time, and Maximian for the seventh, on the eleventh day before the calends of June. By these records it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Paulus was a traditor; the fact being that Sylvanus was then one of his <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacons</a>, and, along with him, produced and surrendered certain things belonging to the Lord's house, which had been most carefully concealed, namely a box  and a lamp of silver, upon seeing which a certain Victor is reported to have said, <q>You would have been <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> if you had not found these.</q> Your <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> makes great account of this Sylvanus, this clearly convicted traditor, in the letter which he writes you, mentioning him as then ordained to the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by the Primate Secundus of Tigisis. Let them keep their <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> tongues silent, let them admit the charges which may <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> be brought against themselves, and not utter foolish <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against others. Read to him also, if he permits it, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> records of the proceedings of this same Secundus of Tigisis in the house of Urbanus Donatus, in which he remitted to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as judge, men who confessed themselves to have been traditors&mdash; Donatus of Masculi, Marinns of Aqu&aelig; Tibilitan&aelig;, Donatus of Calama, with whom as his colleagues, though they were confessed traditors, he ordained their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Sylvanus, of whose guilt in the same matter I have given the history above. Read to him also the proceedings before Zenophilus, a man of consular rank, in the course of which a certain <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> of theirs, Nundinarius, being <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with Sylvanus for having <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, brought all these facts into court, proving them incontestably by authentic documents, and the questioning of witnesses, and the reading of public records and many letters.</p>

<p>5. There are many other things which you might read in his hearing, if he is disposed not to dispute angrily, but to listen prudently, such as: the petition of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> to Constantine, begging him to send from <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who should settle this controversy which divided the African <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>; the Acts recording what took place in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, when the case was taken up and decided by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom he sent there: also you might read in other letters how the Emperor aforesaid states that they had made a complaint to him against the decision of their peers&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, namely, whom he had sent to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>; how he appointed other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to try the case over again at Arles; how they appealed from that tribunal also to the Emperor again; how at last he himself investigated the matter; and how he most emphatically declares that they were vanquished by the innocence of C&aelig;cilianus. Let him listen to these things if he be willing, and he will be silent and desist from plotting against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>6. We rely, however, not so much on these documents as on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, wherein a dominion extending to the ends of the earth among all nations is promised as the heritage of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, separated from which by their sinful <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> they reproach us with the crimes which belong to the chaff in the Lord's threshing-floor, which must be permitted to remain mixed with the good grain until the end come, until the whole be winnowed in the final judgment. From which it is manifest that, whether these charges be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> or false, they do not belong to the Lord's wheat, <span class="stiki" id="note111715"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;13:30</a></span> which must grow until the end of the world throughout the whole field, <em> i.e.</em> the whole earth; as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, not by the testimony of a false <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> such as confirmed your correspondent in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but from the words of the Lord in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. And because these unhappy <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> have brought the reproach of many false and empty accusations against <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who were blameless, but who are throughout the world mingled with the chaff or tares, <em>i.e.</em> with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> unworthy of the name, therefore God has, in righteous retribution, appointed that they should, by their universal Council, condemn as schismatics the Maximianists, because they had condemned Primianus, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while not in communion with Primianus, and rebaptized those whom he had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and then after a short interval should, under the coercion of Optatus the minion of Gildo, reinstate in the honours of their office two of these, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> Felicianus of Musti and Pr&aelig;textatus of Assuri, and acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of all whom they, while under sentence and <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>, had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. If, therefore, they are not defiled by communion with the men thus restored again to their office&mdash;men whom with their own mouth they had condemned as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impious, and whom they compared to those first <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> whom the earth swallowed up alive, &mdash; let them at last awake and consider how great is their blindness and folly in pronouncing the whole world defiled by unknown crimes of Africans, and the heritage of Christ (which according to the promise has been shown unto all nations) destroyed through the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of these Africans by the maintenance of communion with them; while they refuse to acknowledge themselves to be destroyed and defiled by communicating with men whose crimes they had both <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and condemned.</p>

<p>7. Wherefore, since the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says in another place, that even <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> transforms himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light, and that therefore it is not strange that his servants should assume the guise of ministers of righteousness: <span class="stiki" id="note111717"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:13-15</a></span> if your correspondent did indeed see an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> teaching him <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and desiring to separate <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, he has met with an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> transforming himself into an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of light. If, however, he has lied to you, and has seen no such vision, he is himself a servant of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, assuming the guise of a minister of righteousness. And yet, if he be not incorrigibly obstinate and perverse, he may, by considering all the things now stated, be delivered both from misleading others, and from being himself misled. For, embracing the opportunity which you have given, we have met him without any rancour, remembering in regard to him the words of the apostle: <q>The servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, apt to teach, patient; in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God perhaps will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who are taken captive by him at his will.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111718"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse24">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:24-26</a></span> If, therefore, we have said anything severe, let him <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it arises not from the bitterness of controversy, but from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> vehemently desiring his return to the right path. May you live safe in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, most beloved and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> brother!</p>
