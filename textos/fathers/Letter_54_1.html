<h1>Letter 54</h1>

<p> <em>To Serapion, concerning the death of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>.</em></p>

<p>Athanasius to Serapion , a brother and fellow-minister, health in the Lord.</p>

<p>I have read the letters of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, in which you have requested me to make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you the events of my times relating to myself, and to give an account of that most impious <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, in consequence of which I have endured these sufferings, and also of the manner of the death of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. With two out of your three demands I have readily undertaken to comply, and have sent to your Godliness what I wrote to the Monks; from which you will be able to learn my own history as well as that of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. But with respect to the other matter, I mean the death, I debated with myself for a long time, fearing lest any one should suppose that I was exulting in the death of that man. But yet, since a disputation which has taken place among you concerning the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, has issued in this question, whether <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> died after previously communicating with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; I therefore was necessarily desirous of giving an account of his death, as thinking that the question would thus be set at rest, considering also that by making this <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> I should at the same time silence those who are fond of contention. For I conceive that when the wonderful circumstances connected with his death become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, even those who before questioned it will no longer venture to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is hateful in the sight of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. I was not at Constantinople when he died, but Macarius the Presbyter was, and I heard the account of it from him. <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> had been invited by the Emperor Constantine, through the interest of Eusebius and his fellows; and when he entered the presence the Emperor enquired of him, whether he held the Faith of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? And he declared upon <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> that he held the right Faith, and gave in an account of his Faith in writing, suppressing the points for which he had been cast out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the Bishop Alexander, and speciously alleging expressions out of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. When therefore he swore that he did not profess the opinions for which Alexander had <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> him, [the Emperor] dismissed him, saying , 'If your Faith be right, you have done well to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>; but if your Faith be impious, and you have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>, God judge of you according to your <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>.' When he thus came forth from the presence of the Emperor, Eusebius and his fellows, with their accustomed <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, desired to bring him into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But Alexander, the Bishop of Constantinople of blessed memory, resisted them, saying that the inventor of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> ought not to be admitted to communion; whereupon Eusebius and his fellows threatened, declaring, 'As we have caused him to be invited by the Emperor, in opposition to your wishes, so tomorrow, though it be contrary to your desire, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> shall have communion with us in this Church.' It was the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath</a> when they said this.</p>

<p>3. When the Bishop Alexander heard this, he was greatly distressed, and entering into the church, he stretched forth his hands unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and bewailed himself; and casting himself upon his face in the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a>, he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, lying upon the pavement. Macarius also was present, and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> with him, and heard his words. And he besought these two things, saying, 'If <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> is brought to communion tomorrow, let me Your servant depart, and destroy not the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> with the impious; but if You will spare Your Church (and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that You will spare), look upon the words of Eusebius and his fellows, and give not your inheritance to destruction and reproach <span class="stiki" id="note284661"><a href="../bible/joe002.htm#verse17">Joel&nbsp;2:17</a></span>, and take off <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, lest if he enter into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> also may seem to enter with him, and henceforward impiety be accounted for <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.' When the Bishop had thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, he retired in great anxiety; and a wonderful and extraordinary circumstance took place. While Eusebius and his fellows threatened, the Bishop <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>; but <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, who had great confidence in Eusebius and his fellows, and talked very wildly, urged by the necessities of nature withdrew, and suddenly, in the language of Scripture, 'falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst <span class="stiki" id="note284662"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse18">Acts&nbsp;1:18</a></span>,' and immediately expired as he lay, and was deprived both of communion and of his life together.</p>

<p>4. Such has been the end of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>: and Eusebius and his fellows, overwhelmed with shame, buried their accomplice, while the blessed Alexander, amidst the rejoicings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, celebrated the Communion with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> with all the brethren, and greatly glorifying <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not as exulting in his death (God forbid!), for 'it is appointed unto all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> once to die <span class="stiki" id="note284663"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse27">Hebrews&nbsp;9:27</a></span>,' but because this thing had been shown forth in a manner transcending <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> judgments. For the Lord Himself judging between the threats of Eusebius and his fellows, and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Alexander, condemned the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, showing it to be unworthy of communion with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and making manifest to all, that although it receive the support of the Emperor and of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, yet it was condemned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself. So the antichristian gang of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> madmen has been shown to be unpleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and impious; and many of those who before were deceived by it changed their opinions. For none other than the Lord Himself who was <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> by them condemned the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which rose up against Him, and again showed that howsoever the Emperor Constantius may now use <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to the Bishops in behalf of it, yet it is excluded from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and alien from the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. Wherefore also let the question which has arisen among you be henceforth set at rest; (for this was the agreement made among you), and let no one join himself to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but let even those who have been deceived repent. For who shall receive what the Lord condemned? And will not he who takes up the support of that which He has made excommunicate, be guilty of great impiety, and manifestly an enemy of Christ?</p>

<p>5. Now this is sufficient to confound the contentious; read it therefore to those who before raised this question, as well as what was briefly addressed to the Monks against the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, in order that they may be led thereby more strongly to condemn the impiety and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> madmen. Do not however consent to give a copy of these to any one, neither transcribe them for yourself (I have signified the same to the Monks also); but as a sincere friend, if anything is wanting in what I have written, add it, and immediately send them back to me. For you will be able to learn from the letter which I have written to the Brethren, what pains it has cost me to write it, and also to perceive that it is not safe for the writings of a private person to be published (especially if they relate to the highest and chief doctrines), for this reason&mdash;lest what is imperfectly expressed through infirmity or the obscurity of language, do hurt to the reader. For the majority of men do not consider the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or the aim of the writer, but either through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> or a spirit of contention, receive what is written as themselves choose, according to an opinion which they have previously formed, and misinterpret it to suit their pleasure. But the Lord grant that the Truth and a sound  <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> may prevail among all, and especially among those to whom you read this. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
