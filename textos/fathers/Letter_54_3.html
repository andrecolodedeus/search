<h1>Letter 54</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To the Chorepiscopi</em>.</p>

<p>I am much distressed that the canons of the Fathers have fallen through, and that the exact discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been banished from among you. I am apprehensive lest, as this indifference grows, the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should, little by little, fall into confusion. According to the ancient custom observed in the Churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, ministers in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were received after careful examination; the whole of their life was investigated; an enquiry was made as to their being neither railers nor drunkards, not quick to quarrel, keeping their youth in subjection, so as to be able to maintain <q>the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> without which no man shall see the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322200"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;12:14</a></span> This examination was made by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> living with them. Then they brought them to the Chorepiscopi; and the Chorepiscopi, after receiving the suffrages of the witnesses as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and giving information to the Bishop, so admitted the minister to the sacerdotal order.  Now, however, you have quite passed me over; you have not even had the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to refer to me, and have transferred the whole authority to yourselves. Furthermore, with complete indifference, you have allowed <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> to introduce unworthy <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just any one they choose, without any previous examination of life and character, by mere favoritism, on the score of relationship or some other tie. The consequence is, that in every village, there are reckoned many ministers, but not one single man worthy of the service of the altars. Of this you yourselves supply <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from your difficulty in finding suitable candidates for election. As, then, I perceive that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is gradually reaching a point at which it would be incurable, and especially at this moment when a large number of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are presenting themselves for the ministry through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the conscription, I am constrained to have recourse to the restitution of the canons of the Fathers. I thus order you in writing to send me the roll of the ministers in every village, stating by whom each has been introduced, and what is his mode of life. You have the roll in your own keeping, so that your version can be compared with the documents which are in mine, and no one can insert his own name when he likes. So if any have been introduced by <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> after the first appointment,  let them be rejected, and take their place among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. Their examination must then be begun by you over again, and, if they prove worthy, let them be received by your decision. Drive out unworthy men from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and so purge it. For the future, test by examination those who are worthy, and then receive them; but do not reckon them of the number before you have reported to me. Otherwise, distinctly understand that he who is admitted to the ministry without my authority will remain a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>.</p>
