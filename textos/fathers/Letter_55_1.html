<h1>Letter 55</h1>

<p> <em>Letter to Rufinianus.</em></p>

<p>To our lord, son, and most desired fellow-minister Rufinianus.  Athanasius greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>You write what is proper for a beloved son to write to a father: accordingly, I embraced you when you came near me in writing, most desired Rufinianus. And I, though I might write to you as a son both in the opening and the middle and the close, refrained, lest my commendation and testimony should be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by writing. For you are my letter, as it is written <span class="stiki" id="note284666"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:2</a></span>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and read in the heart. That you then are in such case, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, yea <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. I address you, and invite you to write. For by doing so you afford me the highest gratification. But since in an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and church-like spirit, such as becomes your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, you ask me about those who were drawn away by necessity but not corrupted by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and wish me to write what resolution has been come to about them, whether in synods or elsewhere; <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, most desired Lord, that to begin with , when <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> was ceased, a synod  has been held, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from foreign parts being present; while others have been held by our fellow-ministers resident in Greece, as well as by those in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a> : and the same decision had come to here and everywhere, namely, in the case of those who had fallen and been leaders of impiety, to pardon them upon their repentance, but not to give them the position of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>: but in the case of men not deliberate in impiety, but drawn away by necessity and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, that they should not only receive pardon, but should occupy the position of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>: the more so, in that they offered a plausible defence, and what had happened seemed due to a certain special purpose.  For they assured us that they had not gone over to impiety; but lest certain most impious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be elected and ruin the Churches they elected rather to acquiesce in the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and to bear the burden, than to lose the people. But in saying this, they appeared to us to say what was plausible; for they alleged in excuse <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> the brother of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who in the wilderness acquiesced in the people's transgression; and that he had had as his excuse the danger of the people returning to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and abiding in <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For there was reason in the view, that if they remained in the wilderness they might cease from their impiety: but if they went into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> they would become ruined and increase the impiety in their midst. For this reason, then, they have been allowed to rank as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, those who had been deceived and suffered <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> being pardoned. I give this information to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> in the confidence that you will both accept  what has been resolved upon, and not charge those who assembled, as I have said, with remissness. But be good enough to read it to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> under you, that they may be informed, and may not blame you for being thus minded about such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For it would not be fitting for me to write, when your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is able to do so, and to announce our mind with regard to them, and carry out all that remains to be done. Thanks to the Lord that filled you <span class="stiki" id="note284672"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:5</a></span> with all utterance and with all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Let then those that repent openly <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematise</a> by name the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of Eudoxius and Euzoius. For they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> still, and wrote that He was a creature, ringleaders of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. But let them confess the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> confessed by the fathers at Nic&aelig;a, and that they put no other synod before that one. Greet the brotherhood with you. That with us greets you in the Lord.</p>
