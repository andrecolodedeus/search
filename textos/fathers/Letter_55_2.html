<h1>Letter 55</h1>

<p><strong>To Amandus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">A very interesting letter. Amandus a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Burdigala (Bourdeaux) had written to Jerome for an explanation of three passages of scripture, viz. <!--<span class="stiki"></span>-->Matthew 6:34, 1 Corinthians 6:18, 1 Corinthians 15:25, 26, and had in the same letter on behalf of a 'sister' (supposed by Thierry to have been Fabiola) put the following question: 'Can a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> her first husband on account of his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and who has during his lifetime under compulsion married again, communicate with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without first doing penance?' Jerome in his reply gives the explanations asked for but answers the farther question, that concerning the 'sister,' with an emphatic negative. Written about the year 394 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. A short letter does not admit of long explanations; compressing much matter into a small space it can only give a few words to topics which suggest many thoughts. You ask me what is the meaning of the passage in the gospel according to Matthew, <q>take no thought for the morrow. Sufficient unto the day is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301622"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;6:34</a></span> In the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures <q>the morrow</q> signifies the time to come. Thus in Genesis Jacob says: <q>So shall my righteousness answer for me tomorrow.</q>  Again when the two tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh had built an altar and when all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> had sent to them an embassy, they made answer to Phinehas the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> that they had built the altar lest <q>tomorrow</q> it might be said to their children, <q>you have no part in the Lord.</q>  You may find many similar passages in the old instrument.  While then Christ forbids us to take thought for things future, He has allowed us to do so for things present, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> as He does the frailty of our mortal condition. His remaining words <q>sufficient unto the day is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thereof</q> are to be understood as meaning that it is sufficient for us to think of the present troubles of this life. Why need we extend our thoughts to contingencies, to objects which we either cannot obtain or else having obtained must soon relinquish? The Greek word <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> rendered in the Latin version <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a></q> has two distinct meanings, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> and tribulation, which latter the Greek call <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x03C9;&#x03C3;&#x1F77;&#x03BD;</span> and in this passage <q>tribulation</q> would be a better rendering than <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q> But if any one demurs to this and insists that the word <span class="greek">&#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x03BA;&#x1F77;&#x03B1;</span> must mean <q><a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a></q> and not <q>tribulation</q> or <q>trouble,</q> the meaning must be the same as in the words <q>the whole world lies in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a></q>  and as in the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a> in the clause, <q>deliver us from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>:</q>  the purport of the passage will then be that our present conflict with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of this world should be enough for us.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, you ask me concerning the passage in the first epistle of the blessed <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the Corinthians where he says: <q>every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that a man does is without the body; but he that commits fornication <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against his own body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301628"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:18</a></span> Let us go back a little farther and read on until we come to these words, for we must not seek to learn the whole meaning of the section, from the concluding parts of it, or, if I may so say, from the tail of the chapter.  <q>The body is not for fornication but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. And God has both raised up the Lord and will also raise up us [with Him] by his own power. Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. What! Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? For two, says he, shall be one flesh. But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. Flee fornication. Every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that a man does is without the body; but he that commits fornication <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against his own body,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301630"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:13-18</a></span> and so on. The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle has been arguing against excess and has just before said <q>meats for the belly and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301631"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:13</a></span> Now he comes to treat of fornication. For excess in eating is the mother of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; a belly that is distended with food and saturated with draughts of wine is sure to lead to sensual passion. As has been elsewhere said <q>the arrangement of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> organs suggests the course of his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>.</q>  Accordingly all such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> as theft, manslaughter, pillage, <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a>, and the like can be repented of after they have been committed; and, however much interest may tempt him, <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> always smites the offender. It is only <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and sensual pleasure that in the very hour of penitence undergo once more the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the past, the itch of the flesh, and the allurements of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; so that the very thought which we bestow on the correction of such transgressions becomes in itself a new source of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Or to put the matter in a different light: other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are outside of us; and whatever we do we do against others. But fornication defiles the fornicator both in <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and body; and in accordance with the words of the Lord, <q>for this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they two shall be one flesh,</q>  he too becomes one body with a harlot and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against his own body by making what is the temple of Christ the body of a harlot. Not to pass over any suggestion of the Greek commentators, I shall give you one more explanation. It is one thing, they say, to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with the body, and another to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the body. Theft, manslaughter, and all other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> except fornication we commit with our hands outside ourselves. Fornication alone we commit inside ourselves in our bodies and not with our bodies upon others. The preposition 'with' denotes the instrument used in sinning, while the preposition 'in' signifies the sphere of the passion is ourselves. Some again give this explanation that according to the scripture a man's body is his wife and that when a man commits fornication he is said to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against his own body that is against his wife inasmuch as he defiles her by his own fornication and causes her though herself free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to become a sinner through her intercourse with him.</p>

<p>3. I find joined to your letter of inquiries a short paper containing the following words: <q>ask him, (that is me,) whether a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who has left her husband on the ground that he is an adulterer and sodomite and has found herself compelled to take another may in the lifetime of him whom she first left be in communion with the church without doing penance for her fault.</q> As I read the case put I recall the verse <q>they make excuses for their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  We are all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> and all indulgent to our own faults; and what our own will leads us to do we attribute to a necessity of nature. It is as though a young man were to say, <q>I am over-borne by my body, the glow of nature kindles my <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, the structure of my frame and its reproductive organs call for sexual intercourse.</q> Or again a murderer might say, <q>I was in want, I stood in need of food, I had nothing to cover me. If I shed the blood of another, it was to save myself from dying of cold and hunger.</q> Tell the sister, therefore, who thus enquires of me concerning her condition, not my sentence but that of the apostle. <q>Do you not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, brethren (for I speak to them that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives? For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> which has an husband is bound by the law to her husband, so long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband. So then, if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301635"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;7:1-3</a></span> And in another place: <q>the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301636"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse39">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:39</a></span> The apostle has thus cut away every plea and has clearly declared that, if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> marries again while her husband is living, she is an adulteress. You must not speak to me of the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of a ravisher, a mother's pleading, a father's bidding, the influence of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">relatives</a>, the insolence and the intrigues of servants, household losses. A husband may be an adulterer or a sodomite, he may be stained with every crime and may have been left by his wife because of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; yet he is still her husband and, so long as he lives, she may not marry another. The apostle does not promulgate this decree on his own authority but on that of Christ who speaks in him. For he has followed the words of Christ in the gospel: <q>whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fornication, causes her to commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>: and whosoever shall marry her that is <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a>, commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301637"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;5:32</a></span> Mark what he says: <q>whosoever shall marry her that is <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>.</q> Whether she has put away her husband or her husband her, the man who marries her is still an adulterer. Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> seeing how heavy the yoke of marriage was thus made said to Him: <q>if the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry,</q> and the Lord replied, <q>he that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</q> And immediately by the instance of the three eunuchs he shows the blessedness of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> which is bound by no carnal tie. <span class="stiki" id="note301638"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;19:10-12</a></span> </p>

<p>4. I have not been able quite to determine what it is that she means by the words <q>has found herself compelled</q> to marry again. What is this compulsion of which she speaks? Was she overborne by a crowd and ravished against her will? If so, why has she not, thus victimized, subsequently put away her ravisher? Let her read the books of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and she will find that if <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> is offered to a <a href="../cathen/02537c.htm">betrothed</a> virgin in a city and she does not cry out, she is punished as an adulteress: but if she is forced in the field, she is innocent of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and her ravisher alone is amenable to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note301639"><a href="../bible/deu022.htm#verse23">Deuteronomy&nbsp;22:23-27</a></span> Therefore if your sister, who, as she says, has been forced into a second union, wishes to receive the body of Christ and not to be accounted an adulteress, let her do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>; so far at least as from the time she begins to repent to have no farther intercourse with that second husband who ought to be called not a husband but an adulterer. If this seems hard to her and if she cannot leave one whom she has once loved and will not prefer the Lord to sensual pleasure, let her hear the declaration of the apostle: <q>ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table and of the table of devils,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301640"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:21</a></span> and in another place: <q>what communion has light with darkness? And what concord has Christ with <a href="../cathen/02408a.htm">Belial</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301641"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:14-15</a></span> What I am about to say may sound novel but after all it is not new but old for it is supported by the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of the old testament. If she leaves her second husband and desires to be reconciled with her first, she cannot be so now; for it is written in Deuteronomy: <q>When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her; then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house. And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife. And if the latter husband <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> her, and write her a bill of divorcement and gives it in her hand, and sends her out of his house; or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wife; her former husband, which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the Lord: and you shall not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> the land to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, which the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301642"><a href="../bible/deu024.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;24:1-4</a></span> Wherefore, I beseech you, do your best to comfort her and to urge her to seek <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Diseased flesh calls for the knife and the searing-iron. The wound is to blame and not the healing art, if with a cruelty that is really kindness a physician to spare does not spare, and to be merciful is cruel. </p>

<p>5. Your third and last question relates to the passage in the same epistle where the apostle in discussing the resurrection, comes to the words: <q>for he must reign, till he has put all things under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For he has put all things under his feet. But when he says, all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301644"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse25">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:25-28</a></span> I am surprised that you have resolved to question me about this passage when that reverend man, Hilary, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Poictiers, has occupied the eleventh book of his treatise against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> with a full examination and explanation of it. Yet I may at least say a few words. The chief stumbling-block in the passage is that the Son is said to be subject to the Father. Now which is the more shameful and humiliating, to be subject to the Father (often a mark of loving devotion as in the psalm <q><a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is subject unto God</q> ) or to be crucified and made the curse of the cross? For <q>cursed is everyone that hangs on a tree.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301646"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse13">Galatians&nbsp;3:13</a></span> If Christ then for our sakes was made a curse that He might deliver us from the curse of the law, are you surprised that He is also for our sakes subject to the Father to make us too subject to Him as He says in the gospel: <q>No man comes unto the Father but by me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301647"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> and <q>I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> unto me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301648"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;12:32</a></span> Christ then is subject to the Father in the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; for all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, nay the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, are accounted members of His body. But in unbelievers, that is in <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, He is said to be not subject; for these members of His body are not subject to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But in the end of the world when all His members shall see Christ, that is their own body, reigning, they also shall be made subject to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is to their own body, that the whole of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body may be subject unto God and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and that God may be all in all. He does not say <q>that the Father may be all in all</q> but that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a></q> may be, a title which properly belongs to the Trinity and may be referred not only to the Father but also to the Son and to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. His meaning therefore is <q>that humanity may be subject to the Godhead.</q> By humanity we here intend not that gentleness and kindness which the Greeks call philanthropy but the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Moreover when he says <q>that God may be all in all,</q> it is to be taken in this sense. At present our Lord and Saviour is not all in all, but only a part in each of us. For instance He is wisdom in Solomon, generosity in David, patience in Job, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of things to come in Daniel, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in Peter, <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in Phinehas and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in John, and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> in others. But when the end of all things shall come, then shall He be all in all, for then the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> shall severally possess all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and all will possess Christ in His entirety.</p>
