<h1>Letter 55</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Paregorius, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a></em>.</p>

<p>I have given patient attention to your letter, and I am astonished that when you are perfectly well able to furnish me with a short and easy defence by taking action at once, you should choose to persist in what is my ground of complaint, and endeavour to cure the incurable by writing a long story about it. I am not the first, Paregorius, nor the only man, to lay down the law that <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> are not to live with men. Read the canon put forth by our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers at the Council of Nic&aelig;a, which distinctly forbids subintroducts. Unmarried life is honourably distinguished by its being cut off from all female society. If, then, any one, who is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by the outward profession, in reality follows the example of those who live with wives, it is obvious that he only affects the distinction of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> in name, and does not hold aloof from unbecoming indulgence. You ought to have been all the more ready to submit yourself without difficulty to my demands, in that you allege that you are free from all bodily appetite. I do not suppose that a man of three score years and ten lives with a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from any such feelings, and I have not decided, as I have decided, on the ground of any crime having been committed. But we have learned from the Apostle, not to put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in a brother's way; <span class="stiki" id="note322204"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;14:13</a></span> and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what is done very properly by some, naturally becomes to others an occasion for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. I have therefore given my order, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the injunction of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, that you are to separate from the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. Why then, do you find fault with the Chorepiscopus? What is the good of mentioning ancient ill-will? Why do you blame me for lending an easy ear to <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a>? Why do you not rather lay the blame on yourself, for not consenting to break off your connection with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>? Expel her from your house, and establish her in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. Let her live with <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, and do you be served by men, that the name of God be not <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a> in you. Till you have so done, the innumerable arguments, which you use in your letters, will not do you the slightest service. You will die useless, and you will have to give an account to God for your uselessness. If you persist in clinging to your clerical position without correcting your ways, you will be accursed before all the people, and all, who receive you, will be excommunicate throughout the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. </p>
