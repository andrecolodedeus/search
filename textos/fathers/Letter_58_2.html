<h1>Letter 58</h1>

<p><strong>To Paulinus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">In this his second letter to Paulinus of Nola Jerome dissuades him from making a pilgrimage to the Holy Places, and describes Jerusalem not as it ought to be but as it is. He then gives his friend counsels for his life similar to those which he has previously addressed to Nepotian, praises Paulinus for his Panegyric (now no longer extant) on the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>, compares his style with those of the great writers of the Latin Church, and concludes with a commendation of his messenger, that Vigilantius who was soon to become the object of his bitterest contempt. Written about the year 395 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. <q>A <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301732"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse35">Matthew&nbsp;12:35</a></span> and <q>every tree is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by his fruit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301733"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse44">Luke&nbsp;6:44</a></span> You measure me by the scale of your own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> and because of your own greatness magnify my littleness. You take the lowest room at the banquet that the goodman of the house may bid you to go up higher. <span class="stiki" id="note301734"><a href="../bible/luk014.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;14:10</a></span> For what is there in me or what qualities do I possess that I should merit praise from a man of learning? That I, small and lowly as I am, should be eulogized by lips which have pleaded on behalf of our most religious sovereign? Do not, my dearest brother, estimate my worth by the number of my years. Gray hairs are not wisdom; it is wisdom which is as good as gray hairs. At least that is what Solomon says: <q>wisdom is the gray hair unto men.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301735"><a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse9">Wisdom&nbsp;4:9</a></span> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> too in choosing the seventy elders is told to take those whom he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be elders indeed, and to select them not for their years but for their discretion. <span class="stiki" id="note301736"><a href="../bible/num011.htm#verse16">Numbers&nbsp;11:16</a></span> And, as a boy, Daniel judges old men and in the flower of youth condemns the incontinence of age.  Do not, I repeat, weigh <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by years, nor suppose me better than yourself merely because I have enlisted under Christ's banner earlier than you. The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that chosen vessel framed out of a persecutor, <span class="stiki" id="note301738"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse15">Acts&nbsp;9:15</a></span> though last in the apostolic order is first in merit. For though last he has laboured more than they all. <span class="stiki" id="note301739"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:10</a></span> To Judas it was once said: you are a man who took sweet food with me, my guide and mine acquaintance; we walked in the house of God with company:  yet the Saviour accuses him of betraying his friend and master. A line of Virgil well describes his end:</p>

<blockquote><p>From a high beam he knots a hideous death. </p></blockquote>

<p>The dying robber, on the contrary, exchanges the cross for paradise and turns to <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> the penalty of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. How many there are nowadays who have lived so long that they bear corpses rather than bodies and are like whited sepulchres filled with dead men's bones! <span class="stiki" id="note301742"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse27">Matthew&nbsp;23:27</a></span> A newly kindled heat is more effective than a long continued lukewarmness.</p>

<p>2. As for you, when you hear the Saviour's counsel: <q>if you will be perfect, go and sell that you have, and give to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and come follow me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301743"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;19:21</a></span> you translate his words into action; and baring yourself to follow the bare cross  you mount Jacob's ladder the easier for carrying nothing. Your dress changes with the change in your convictions, and you aim at no showy shabbiness which leaves your purse as full as before. No, with pure hands and a clear <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> you make it your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> that you are poor both in spirit and in deed. There is nothing great in wearing a sad or a disfigured face, in simulating and in showing off <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, or in wearing a cheap cloak while you retain a large income. When Crates the Theban&mdash; a millionaire of days gone by&mdash; was on his way to Athens to study <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, he cast away untold gold in the belief that <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> could not be compatible with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. What a contrast he offers to us, the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of a poor Christ, who cram our pockets with gold and cling under pretext of almsgiving to our old riches. How can we faithfully distribute what belongs to another when we thus timidly keep back what is our own? <span class="stiki" id="note301745"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse12">Luke&nbsp;16:12</a></span> When the stomach is full, it is easy to talk of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>. What is praiseworthy is not to have been at Jerusalem but to have lived a good life while there.  The city which we are to praise and to seek is not that which has slain the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> <span class="stiki" id="note301747"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;23:37</a></span> and shed the blood of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but that which is made glad by the streams of the river,  which is set upon a mountain and so cannot be hid, <span class="stiki" id="note301749"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;5:14</a></span> which the apostle declares to be a mother of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note301750"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse26">Galatians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> and in which he rejoices to have his citizenship with the righteous. </p>

<p>3. In speaking thus I am not laying myself open to a charge of inconsistency or condemning the course which I have myself taken. It is not, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, for nothing that I, like <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, have left my home and people. But I do not presume to limit God's omnipotence or to restrict to a narrow strip of earth Him whom the heaven cannot contain. Each believer is judged not by his residence in this place or in that but according to the deserts of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshippers worship the Father neither at Jerusalem nor on mount Gerizim; for <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is a spirit, and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301752"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;4:24</a></span> <q>Now the spirit blows where it lists,</q>  and <q>the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof.</q>  When the fleece of Jud&aelig;a was made dry although the whole world was wet with the dew of heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note301755"><a href="../bible/jdg006.htm#verse36">Judges&nbsp;6:36-40</a></span> and when many came from the East and from the West <span class="stiki" id="note301756"><a href="../bible/luk013.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;13:29</a></span> and sat in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom: <span class="stiki" id="note301757"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse22">Luke&nbsp;16:22</a></span> then God ceased to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in Judah only and His name to be great in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> alone;  the sound of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> went out into all the earth and their words into the ends of the world.  The Saviour Himself speaking to His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in the temple  said: <q>arise, let us go hence,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301761"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;14:31</a></span> and to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>your house is left unto you desolate.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301762"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;23:38</a></span> If heaven and earth must pass away, <span class="stiki" id="note301763"><a href="../bible/luk021.htm#verse33">Luke&nbsp;21:33</a></span> obviously all things that are earthly must pass away also. Therefore the spots which witnessed the crucifixion and the resurrection profit those only who bear their several crosses, who day by day rise again with Christ, and who thus show themselves worthy of an abode so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>. Those who say <q>the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301764"><a href="../bible/jer007.htm#verse4">Jeremiah&nbsp;7:4</a></span> should give ear to the words of the apostle: <q>you are the temple of the Lord,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301765"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <q>dwells in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301766"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse11">Romans&nbsp;8:11</a></span> Access to the courts of heaven is as easy from Britain as it is from Jerusalem; for <q>the kingdom of God is within you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301767"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse21">Luke&nbsp;17:21</a></span> Antony and the hosts of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> who are in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, Mesopotamia, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, Cappadocia, and Armenia, have never seen Jerusalem: and the door of Paradise is opened for them at a distance from it. The blessed Hilarion, though a native of and a dweller in Palestine, only set eyes on Jerusalem for a single day, not wishing on the one hand when he was so near to neglect the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places, nor yet on the other to appear to confine God within local limits. From the time of <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Hadrian</a> to the reign of Constantine&mdash; a period of about one hundred and eighty years &mdash; the spot which had witnessed the resurrection was occupied by a figure of Jupiter; while on the rock where the cross had stood, a marble <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> of Venus was set up by the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> and became an object of worship. The original persecutors, indeed, supposed that by polluting our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places they would deprive us of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the passion and in the resurrection. Even my own <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, as it now is, that most venerable spot in the whole world of which the psalmist sings: <q>the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has sprung out of the earth,</q>  was overshadowed by a grove of Tammuz, <span class="stiki" id="note301770"><a href="../bible/eze008.htm#verse14">Ezekiel&nbsp;8:14</a></span> that is of Adonis; and in the very cave  where the infant Christ had uttered His earliest cry lamentation was made for the paramour of Venus. </p>

<p>4. Why, you will say, do I make these remote allusions? To assure you that nothing is lacking to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> although you have not seen Jerusalem and that I am none the better for living where I do. Be assured that, whether you dwell here or elsewhere, a like recompense is in store for your good works with our Lord. Indeed, if I am frankly to express my own feelings, when I take into consideration your vows and the earnestness with which you have renounced the world, I hold that as long as you live in the country one place is as good as another. Forsake cities and their crowds, live on a small patch of ground, seek Christ in solitude, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> on the mount alone with Jesus, <span class="stiki" id="note301773"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm">Luke&nbsp;vi</a></span> keep near to <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places: keep out of cities, I say, and you will never lose your vocation. My advice concerns not <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, for these have a different duty. I am speaking only to a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> who having been a man of note in the world has laid the price of his possessions at the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles'</a> feet, <span class="stiki" id="note301774"><a href="../bible/act004.htm#verse37">Acts&nbsp;4:37</a></span> to show men that they must trample on their money, and has resolved to live a life of loneliness and seclusion and always to continue to reject what he has once rejected. Had the scenes of the Passion and of the Resurrection been elsewhere than in a populous city with court and garrison, with prostitutes, playactors, and buffoons, and with the medley of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> usually found in such centres; or had the crowds which thronged it been composed of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; then a city would be a desirable abode for those who have embraced the monastic life. But, as things are, it would be the height of folly first to renounce the world, to  repudiate one's country, to forsake cities, to profess one's self a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>; and then to live among still greater numbers the same kind of life that you would have lived in your own country. Men rush here from all quarters of the world, the city is filled with people of every race, and so great is the throng of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that here you will have to tolerate in its full dimensions an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from which you desired to flee when you found it partially developed elsewhere.</p>

<p>5. Since you ask me as a brother in what path you should walk, I will be open with you. If you wish to take duty as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, and are attracted by the work or dignity which falls to the lot of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, live in cities and walled towns,  and by so doing turn the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of others into the profit of your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But if you desire to be in deed what you are in name&mdash; a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>,  that is, one who lives alone, what have you to do with cities which are the homes not of solitaries but of crowds? Every mode of life has its own exponents. For instance, let Roman generals imitate men like Camillus, Fabricius, Regulus, and Scipio. Let <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> take for models Pythagoras, Socrates, <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>, and Aristotle. Let poets strive to rival Homer, Virgil, Menander, and Terence. Let writers of history follow Thucydides, Sallust, Herodotus and Livy. Let orators find masters in Lysias, the Gracchi, Demosthenes, and Tully. And, to come to our own case, let <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> take for their examples the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> or their companions; and as they hold the rank which these once held, let them endeavour to exhibit the same excellence. And last of all let us <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> take as the patterns which we are to follow the lives of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, of Antony, of Julian, of Hilarion, of the Macarii. And to go back to the authority of scripture, we have our masters in Elijah and Elisha, and our leaders in the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>; who lived in fields and solitary places and made themselves tents by the waters of Jordan. <span class="stiki" id="note301777"><a href="../bible/2ki006.htm#verse1">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;6:1-2</a></span> The sons of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a> too are of the number who drank neither wine nor strong drink and who abode in tents; men whom God's voice praises through Jeremiah, <span class="stiki" id="note301778"><a href="../bible/jer035.htm">Jeremiah&nbsp;xxxv</a></span> and to whom a promise is made that there shall never be wanting a man of their stock to stand before God. <span class="stiki" id="note301779"><a href="../bible/jer035.htm#verse19">Jeremiah&nbsp;35:19</a></span> This is probably what is meant by the title of the seventy-first psalm: <q>of the sons of Jonadab and of those who were first led into captivity.</q>  The person intended is Jonadab the son of <a href="../cathen/12676a.htm">Rechab</a> who is described in the book of Kings <span class="stiki" id="note301781"><a href="../bible/2ki010.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;10:15-16</a></span> as having gone up into the chariot of Jehu. His sons having always lived in tents until at last (owing to the inroads made by the Chaldean army) they were forced to come into Jerusalem, are described <span class="stiki" id="note301782"><a href="../bible/jer035.htm#verse11">Jeremiah&nbsp;35:11</a></span> as being the first to undergo captivity; because after the freedom of their lonely life they found confinement in a city as bad as imprisonment.</p>

<p>6. Since you are not wholly independent but are bound to a wife who is your sister in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, I entreat you&mdash; whether here or there&mdash; that you will avoid large gatherings, visits official and complimentary, and social parties, indulgences all of which tend to enchain the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Let your food be coarse&mdash; say cabbage and pulse&mdash; and do not take it until evening. Sometimes as a great delicacy you may have some small fish. He who longs for Christ and feeds upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> bread cares little for dainties which must be transmuted into ordure. Food that you cannot taste when once it has passed your gullet might as well be&mdash; so far as you are concerned&mdash; bread and pulse. You have my books against Jovinian which speak yet more largely of despising the appetite and the palate. Let some <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> volume be ever in your hand. Pray constantly, and bowing down your body lift up your mind to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. Keep frequent <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> and sleep often on an empty stomach. Avoid tittle-tattle and all self-laudation. Flee from wheedling flatterers as from open enemies. Distribute with your own hand provisions to alleviate the miseries of the poor and of the brethren. With your own hands, I say, for good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is rare among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. You do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what I say? Think of Judas and his bag. Seek not a lowly garb for a swelling <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Avoid the society of men of the world, especially if they are in power. Why need you look again on things contempt for which has made you a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>? Above all let your sister  hold aloof from married ladies. And, if <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> round her wear silk dresses and gems while she is meanly attired, let her neither fret nor congratulate herself. For by so doing she will either regret her resolution or sow the seeds of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. If you are already famed as a faithful steward of your own substance, do not take other people's money to give away. You understand what I mean, for the Lord has given you understanding in all things. Be simple as a dove and lay snares for no man: but be cunning as a serpent and let no man lay snares for you. <span class="stiki" id="note301784"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;10:16</a></span> For a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> who allows others to deceive him is almost at much at fault as one who tries to deceive others. If a man talks to you always or nearly always about money (except it be about <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">almsgiving</a>, a topic which is open to all) treat him as a broker rather than a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>. Besides food and clothing and things manifestly necessary  give no man anything; for dogs must not eat the children's bread. <span class="stiki" id="note301785"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;15:26</a></span> </p>

<p>7. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> temple of Christ is the believer's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; adorn this, clothe it, offer gifts to it, welcome Christ in it. What use are walls blazing with jewels when Christ in His poor <span class="stiki" id="note301786"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse40">Matthew&nbsp;25:40</a></span> is in danger of perishing from hunger? Your possessions are no longer your own but a stewardship is entrusted to you. Remember Ananias and Sapphira who from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the future kept what was their own, and be careful for your part not rashly to squander what is Christ's. Do not, that is, by an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of judgment give the property of the poor to those who are not poor; lest, as a wise man has told us,  charity prove the death of charity. Look not upon</p>

<blockquote><p>Gay trappings or a Cato's empty name. 
<br>In the words of Persius, God says:&mdash;
<br>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your thoughts and read your inmost <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>To be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> is the great thing, not merely to seem one. And somehow or other those please the world most who please Christ least. In speaking thus I am not like the sow lecturing Minerva; but, as a friend warns a friend, so I warn you before you embark on your new course. I would rather fail in ability than in will to serve you; for my wish is that where I have fallen you may keep your footing.</p>

<p>8. It is with much pleasure that I have read the book which you have sent to me containing your wise and eloquent defence of the emperor Theodosius; and your arrangement of the subject has particularly pleased me. While in the earlier chapters you surpass others, in the latter you surpass yourself. Your style is terse and neat; it has all the purity of Tully, and yet it is packed with meaning. For, as someone has said,  that speech is a failure of which men only praise the diction. You have been successful in preserving both sequence of subjects and <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logical</a> connection. Whatever sentence one takes, it is always a conclusion to what goes before or an introduction to what follows. Theodosius is fortunate in having a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> orator like you to plead his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. You have made his purple illustrious and have <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for future ages his useful <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. Go on and prosper, for, if such be your first ventures in the field, what will you not do when you become a trained soldier? Oh! That it were mine to conduct a genius like you, not (as the poets sing) through the Aonian mountains and the peaks of Helicon but through Zion and Tabor and the high places of Sinai. If I might teach you what I have learned myself and might pass on to you the mystic rolls of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, then might we give birth to something such as Greece with all her learning could not show.</p>

<p>9. Hear me, therefore, my fellow-servant, my friend, my brother; give ear for a moment that I may tell you how you are to walk in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures. All that we read in the divine books, while glistening and shining without, is yet far sweeter within. <q>He who desires to eat the kernel must first break the nut.</q>  <q>Open thou my eyes,</q> says David, <q>that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.</q>  Now, if so great a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> confesses that he is in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; how deep, think you, must be the night of misapprehension with which we, mere babes and unweaned infants, are enveloped! Now this veil rests not only on the face of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note301793"><a href="../bible/2co003.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:14-15</a></span> but on the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> as well.  To the multitudes the Saviour spoke only in <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and, to make it clear that His words had a mystical meaning, said:&mdash; <q>he that has ears to hear, let him hear.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301795"><a href="../bible/luk008.htm#verse8">Luke&nbsp;8:8,&nbsp;10</a></span> Unless all things that are written are opened by Him <q>who has the key of David, who opens and no man shuts, and shuts and no man opens,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301796"><a href="../bible/rev003.htm#verse7">Revelation&nbsp;3:7</a></span> no one can undo the lock or set them before you. If only you had the foundation which He alone can give; nay, if even His fingers were but passed over your work; there would be nothing finer than your volumes, nothing more learned, nothing more attractive, nothing more Latin.</p>

<p>10. <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> is packed with meaning but his style is rugged and uncouth. The blessed Cyprian like a fountain of pure water flows softly and sweetly but, as he is taken up with exhortations to <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and with the troubles consequent on <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, he has nowhere discussed the divine scriptures. Victorinus, although he has the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown, yet cannot express what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>. Lactantius has a flow of eloquence worthy of Tully: would that he had been as ready to teach our doctrines as he was to pull down those of others! Arnobius is lengthy and unequal, and often confused from not making a proper division of his subject. That reverend man Hilary gains in height from his Gallic buskin; yet, adorned as he is with the flowers of Greek rhetoric, he sometimes entangles himself in long periods and offers by no means easy reading to the less learned brethren. I say nothing of other writers whether dead or living; others will hereafter judge them both for good and for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. </p>

<p>11. I will come to yourself, my fellow-mystic, my companion, and my friend; my friend, I say, though not yet personally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>: and I will ask you not to suspect a flatterer in one so intimate. Better that you should think me mistaken or led astray by affection than that you should hold me capable of fawning on a friend. You have a great <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> and an inexhaustible store of language, your diction is fluent and pure, your fluency and purity are mingled with wisdom. Your head is clear and all your senses keen. Were you to add to this wisdom and eloquence a careful study and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of scripture, I should soon see you holding our citadel against all comers; you would go up with Joab upon the roof of Zion, <span class="stiki" id="note301798"><a href="../bible/1ch011.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;11:5-6</a></span> and sing upon the housetops what you had learned in the secret chambers. <span class="stiki" id="note301799"><a href="../bible/luk012.htm#verse3">Luke&nbsp;12:3</a></span> Gird up, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, gird up your loins. As Horace says:&mdash; </p>

<blockquote><p>Life has no gifts for men except they toil. </p></blockquote>

<p>Show yourself as much a man of note in the church, as you were before in the senate. Provide for yourself riches which you may spend daily yet they will not fail. Provide them while you are still strong and while as yet your head has no gray hairs: before, in the words of Virgil,</p>

<blockquote><p>Diseases creep on you, and gloomy age,
<br>And pain, and cruel death's inclemency. </p></blockquote>

<p>I am not content with mediocrity for you: I desire all that you do to be of the highest excellence.</p>

<p>How heartily I have welcomed the reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Vigilantius,  his own lips will tell you better than this letter. Why he has so soon left us and started afresh I cannot say; and, indeed, I do not wish to hurt anyone's feelings.  Still, mere passer-by as he was, in haste to continue his journey, I managed to keep him back until I had given him a taste of my friendship for you. Thus you can learn from him what you want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about me. Kindly salute your reverend sister  and fellow-servant, who with you fights the good fight in the Lord.</p>
