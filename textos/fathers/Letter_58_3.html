<h1>Letter 58</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Gregory my brother</em>. </p>

<p>How am I to dispute with you in writing? How can I lay hold of you satisfactorily, with all your simplicity? Tell me; who ever falls a third time into the same nets? Who ever gets a third time into the same snare? Even a brute beast would find it difficult to do so. You forged one letter, and brought it me as though it came from our right reverend uncle the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, trying to deceive me, I have no idea why. I received it as a letter written by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and delivered by you. Why should I not? I was delighted; I showed it to many of my friends; I thanked God. The <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> was found out, on the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> repudiating it in person. I was thoroughly ashamed; covered as I was with the disgrace of cunning trickery and lies, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> that the earth might open for me. Then they gave me a second letter, as sent by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> himself by the hands of your servant Asterius. Even this second had not really been sent by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, as my very reverend brother Anthimus  has told me. Now Adamantius has come bringing me a third. How ought I to receive a letter carried by you or yours? I might have <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to have a heart of stone, so as neither to remember the past, nor to feel the present; so as to bear every blow, like cattle, with bowed head. But what am I to think, now that, after my first and second experience, I can admit nothing without positive <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>? Thus I write attacking your simplicity, which I see plainly to be neither what generally becomes a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man, nor is appropriate to the present emergency; I write that, at least for the future, you may take care of yourself and spare me. I must speak to you with all freedom, and I tell you that you are an unworthy minister of things so great. However, whoever be the writer of the letter, I have answered as is fit . Whether, then, you yourself are experimenting on me, or whether really the letter which you have sent is one which you have received from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, you have my answer. At such a time as this you ought to have borne in mind that you are my brother, and have not yet forgotten the ties of nature, and do not regard me in the light of an enemy, for I have entered on a life which is wearing out my strength, and is so far beyond my powers that it is injuring even my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Yet for all this, as you have determined to declare <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against me, you ought to have come to me and shared my troubles. For it is said, <q>Brethren and help are against time of trouble.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322214"><!--k28--<a href="../bible/ecc040.htm#verse24">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;40:24</a></span> If the right reverend <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are really willing to meet me, let them make <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me a place and time, and let them invite me by their own men. I do not refuse to meet my own uncle, but I shall not do so unless the invitation reaches me in due and proper form. </p>
