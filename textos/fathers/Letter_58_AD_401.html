<h1>Letter 58 (A.D. 401)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Noble and Worthy Lord Pammachius, My Son, Dearly Beloved in the Bowels of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. The good works which spring from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ in you have given you a claim to be esteemed by us His members, and have made you as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and as much beloved by us as you could be. For even were I daily seeing your face, this could add nothing to the completeness of the acquaintance with you which I now have, when in the shining light of one of your actions I have seen your inner being, fair with the loveliness of peace, and beaming with the brightness of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Seeing this has made me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> you has made me <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> you; and therefore, in addressing you, I write to one who, notwithstanding our distance from each other, has become <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me, and is my beloved friend. The bond which binds us together is indeed of earlier date, and we were living united under One Head: for had you not been rooted in His <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity would not have been so dear to you, and you would not have dealt as you have done with your African tenants  settled in the midst of the consular province of Numidia, the very country in which the folly of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> began, addressing them in such terms, and encouraging them with such enthusiasm, as to persuade them with unhesitating devotion to choose that course which they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that a man of your character and position would not adopt on other grounds than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> ascertained and acknowledged, and to submit themselves, though so remote from you, to the same Head; so that along with yourself they are reckoned for ever as members of Him by whose command they are for the time dependent upon you.</p>

<p>2. Embracing you, therefore, as <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to me by this transaction, I am moved by joyful feelings to congratulate you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, and to send you this letter as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of my heart's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards you; for I cannot do more. I beseech you, however, not to measure the amount of my <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> by this letter; but by means of this letter, when you have read it, pass on by the unseen inner passage which thought opens up into my heart, and see what is there felt towards you. For to the eye of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> shall be unveiled which we shut against the disquieting trifles of this world when there we worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and there you will see the <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> of my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in your good work, an <a href="../cathen/05277a.htm">ecstasy</a> which I cannot describe with tongue or pen, glowing and burning in the offering of praise to Him by whose inspiration you were made willing, and by whose help you were made able to serve Him in this way. <q>Thanks be unto God for His unspeakable gift!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111857"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:15</a></span> </p>

<p>3. Oh how we desire in Africa to see such work as this by which you have gladdened us done by many, who are, like yourself, senators in the State, and sons of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church! It is, however, hazardous to give them this exhortation: they may refuse to follow it, and the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> will take advantage of this to deceive the weak, as if they had gained a victory over us in the minds of those who disregarded our counsel. But it is safe for me to express gratitude to you; for you have already done that by which, in the emancipation of those who were weak, the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are confounded. I have therefore thought it sufficient to ask you to read this letter with friendly boldness to any to whom you can do so on the ground of their <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> profession. For thus learning what you have achieved, they will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that that, about which as an impossibility they are now indifferent, can be done in Africa. As to the snares which these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> contrive in the perversity of their hearts, I have resolved not to speak of them in this letter, because I have been only amused at their imagining that they could gain any advantage over your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which Christ holds as His possession. You will hear them, however, from my brethren, whom I earnestly commend to your Excellency: they <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest you should disdain some things which to you might seem unnecessary in connection with the great and unlooked for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those men over whom, in consequence of your work, their <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Mother rejoices.</p>
