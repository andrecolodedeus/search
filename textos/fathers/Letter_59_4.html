<h1>Letter 59</h1>

<p> <em>To the Clergy and People of the City of Constantinople.</em></p>

<h2>I. He congratulates them on their outspoken resistance to error.</h2>

<p>Leo the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, dignitaries, and people, residing at Constantinople.</p>

<p>Though we are greatly grieved at the things reported to have been done recently in the council of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> at Ephesus, because, as is consistently rumoured, and also demonstrated by results, neither due moderation nor the strictness of the Faith was there observed, yet we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in your devoted <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and in the acclamations of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people , instances of which have been brought to our notice, we have approved of the right feeling of you all; because there lives and abides in good sons due affection for their excellent Father, and because you suffer the fullness of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> teaching to be in no part corrupted. For undoubtedly, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has unfolded to you, they are leagued with the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>' <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, who deny that the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> took our nature's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Manhood, and maintain that all His bodily actions were the actions of a false apparition. And lest you should in anything give your assent to this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, we have now sent you, beloved, by my son Epiphanius and Dionysius, notary of the Roman Church, letters of exhortation wherein we have of our own accord rendered you the assistance which you sought, that you may not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> of our bestowing all a father's care on you, and labouring in every way, by the help of God's mercy, to destroy all the stumbling-blocks which <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and foolish men have raised. And let no one venture to parade his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> dignity who can be convicted of holding such detestably <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> opinions. For if <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> seems hardly tolerable in <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, how much less excusable or pardonable is it in those who govern; especially when they dare even to defend their mendacious and perverse views, and persuade the unsteadfast to agree with them either by intimidation or by cajoling.</p>

<h2>II. They are to be rejected who deny the truth of Christ's flesh, a truth repeated by every recipient at the Holy Eucharist.</h2>

<p>Let such men be rejected by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Body, and let not <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> liberty suffer the yoke of the unfaithful to be laid upon it. For they are to be reckoned outside the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a>, and outside the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, who, denying the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of our flesh in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, gainsay the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> and oppose the Creed. Nor do they perceive that their blindness leads them into such an abyss that they have no sure footing in the reality either of the Lord's Passion or His Resurrection: because both are discredited in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, if our fleshly nature is not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in Him. In what density of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, in what utter sloth must they hitherto have lain, not to have learned from hearing, nor understood from reading, that which in God's Church is so constantly in men's mouths, that even the tongues of infants do not keep silence upon the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Body and Blood at the rite of Holy Communion ? For in that mystic distribution of spiritual nourishment, that which is given and taken is of such a kind that receiving the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of the celestial food we pass into the flesh of Him, Who became our flesh.  Hence to confirm you, beloved, in your laudably faithful resistance to the foes of Truth, I shall fully and opportunely use the language and sentiments of the Apostle, and say: <q>Therefore I also hearing of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which is in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards all <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, do not cease to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Him, the eyes of your hearts being enlightened that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is the hope of His calling, and what the riches of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His inheritance among the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power in us, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> according to the working of His mighty power which he has wrought in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, raising Him from the dead, and setting Him at His right hand in heavenly places above every principality, and power, and strength, and dominion, and every name which is named not only in this age, but also in that which is to come: and has put all things under His feet, and given Him to be the head over all the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is His body, and the fullness of Him Who fills all in all <span class="stiki" id="note360387"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse15">Ephesians&nbsp;1:15-23</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>III. Perfect God and perfect Man were united in Christ.</h2>

<p>In this passage let the adversaries of the Truth say when or according to what nature did the Almighty Father exalt His Son above all things, or to what substance did He subject all things. For the Godhead of the Word is equal in all things, and consubstantial with the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the power of the Begetter and the Begotten is one and the same always and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a>. Certainly, the Creator of all natures, since <q>through Him all things were made, and without Him was nothing made <span class="stiki" id="note360388"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span>,</q> is above all things which He created, nor were the things which He made ever not subject to their Creator, Whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> property it is, to be from none other than the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and in no way different to the Father. If greater power, grander dignity, more exalted loftiness was granted Him, then was He that was so increased less than He that promoted Him, and possessed not the full riches of His nature from Whose fullness He received. But one who thinks thus is hurried off into the society of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is much assisted by this <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> which denies the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>, so that, in rejecting the combination of humility with majesty in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it either asserts a false phantom-body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, or says that all His bodily actions and <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> belonged to the Godhead rather than to the flesh. But everything he ventures to uphold is absolutely foolish: because neither our religious belief nor the scope of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> admits either of the Godhead suffering anything or of the Truth belying Itself in anything. The impassible <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, therefore, whose perpetually it is with the Father and with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> to be what He is in the one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the Unchangeable Trinity, when the fullness of time had come which had been fore-ordained by an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> purpose, and promised by the prophetic significance of words and <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, became man not by conversion of His substance but by assumption of our nature, and <q>came to seek and to save that which was lost <span class="stiki" id="note360389"><a href="../bible/luk019.htm#verse10">Luke&nbsp;19:10</a></span> .</q> But He came not by local approach nor by bodily motion, as if to be present where He had been absent, or to depart where He had come: but He came to be manifested to onlookers by that which was visible and common to others, receiving, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> flesh and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the Virgin mother's womb, so that, abiding in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, He united to Himself the form of a slave, and the likeness of sinful flesh, whereby He did not lessen the Divine by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but increased the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> by the Divine.</p>

<h2>IV. The Sacrament of Baptism typifies and realizes this union to each individual believer.</h2>

<p>For such was the state of all mortals resulting from our first ancestors that, after the transmission of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to their descendants, no one would have escaped the punishment of condemnation, had not the Word become flesh and dwelt in us, that is to say, in that nature which belonged to our blood and race. And accordingly, the Apostle says: <q>As by one man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (judgment passed) upon all to condemnation, so also by one man's righteousness (it) passed upon all to justification of life. For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one man's <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> shall many be made righteous <span class="stiki" id="note360390"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;5:18-19</a></span>;</q> and again, <q>For because by man (came) death, by man also (came) the resurrection of the dead. And as in <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive <span class="stiki" id="note360391"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:21-22</a></span> .</q> All they to wit who though they be born in Adam, yet are found reborn in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, having a sure testimony both to their justification by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and to Christ's sharing in their nature ; for he who does not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that God's only-begotten Son did assume our nature in the womb of the Virgin-daughter of David, is without share in the Mystery of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, and, as he neither recognizes the Bridegroom nor <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> the Bride, can have no place at the wedding-banquet. For the flesh of Christ is the veil of the Word, wherewith every one is clothed who confesses Him unreservedly. But he that is ashamed of it and rejects it as unworthy, shall have no adornment from Him, and though he present himself at the Royal feast, and unseasonably join in the sacred banquet, yet the intruder will not be able to escape the King's discernment, but, as the Lord Himself asserted, will be taken, and with hands and feet bound, be cast into outer darkness; where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Hence whosoever confesses not the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> body in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he is unworthy of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the Incarnation, and has no share in that sacred union of which the Apostle speaks, saying, <q>For we are His members, of His flesh and of His bones. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> a man shall leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife, and there shall be two in one flesh. </q> And explaining what was meant by this, he added, <q>This <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is great, but I speak in respect of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</q> Therefore, from the very commencement of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, Christ is announced to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> as coming in the flesh. In which, as was said, <q>there shall be two in one flesh,</q> there are undoubtedly two, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which issued from the Bridegroom's flesh, when it received the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of redemption and regeneration, water and blood flowing from the side of the Crucified. For the very condition of a new creature which at <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> puts off not the covering of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> flesh but the taint of the old condemnation, is this, that a man is made the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, because Christ also is the body of a man. </p>

<h2>V. The true doctrine of the Incarnation restated and commended to their keeping.</h2>

<p>Wherefore we call <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> only, as the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, nor <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">Man</a> only, as the Photinian  <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, nor man in such a way that anything should be wanting in Him which certainly belongs to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, whether <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or reasonable mind or flesh which was not derived from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, but made from the Word turned and changed into flesh; which three false and empty propositions have been variously advanced by the three sections of the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.  Nor do we say that the blessed Virgin Mary conceived a Man without Godhead, Who was created by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and afterwards assumed by the Word, which we deservedly and properly condemned <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> for preaching: but we call Christ the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father without any beginning in time, and likewise <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Man, born of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> Mother, at the ordained fullness of time, and we say that His Manhood, whereby the Father is the greater, does not in anything lessen that nature whereby He is equal with the Father. But these two <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">natures</a> form one Christ, Who has said most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> both according to His Godhead: <q>I and the Father are one ,</q> and according to His manhood <q>the Father is greater than I. </q> This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and indestructible Faith, dearly-beloved, which alone makes us <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and which, as we hear with approval, you are defending with loyal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and praiseworthy affection, hold fast and maintain boldly. And since, besides God's aid, you must win the favour of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Princes also, humbly and wisely make request that the most clement Emperor be pleased to grant our petition, wherein we have asked for a plenary synod to be convened; that by the aid of God's mercy the sound may be increased in <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and the sick, if they consent to be treated, have the remedy applied. (Dated October 15, in the consulship of the illustrious Asturius and Protogenes, 449.)</p>
