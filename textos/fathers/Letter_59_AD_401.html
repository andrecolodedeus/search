<h1>Letter 59 (A.D. 401)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Most Blessed Lord and Venerable Father Victorinus, My Brother in the Priesthood, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. Your summons to the Council reached me on the fifth day before the Ides of November, in the evening, and found me very much indisposed, so that I could not possibly attend. However, I submit to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and wise judgment whether certain perplexities which the summons occasioned were due to my own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> or to sufficient grounds. I read in that summons that it was written also to the districts of Mauritania, which, as we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, have their own primates. Now, if these provinces were to be represented in a Council held in Numidia, it was by all means proper that the names of some of the more eminent <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are in Mauritania should be attached to the circular letter; and not finding this, I have been greatly surprised. Moreover, to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of Numidia it has been addressed in such a confused and careless manner, that my own name I find in the third place, although I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my proper order to be much further down in the roll of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. This wrongs others, and grieves me. Moreover, our venerable father and colleague, Xantippus of Tagosa, says that the primacy belongs to him, and by very many he is regarded as the primate, and he issues such letters as you have sent. Even supposing that this be a mistake, which your Holiness can easily discover and correct, certainly his name should not have been omitted in the summons which you have issued. If his name had been placed in the middle of the list, and not in the first line, I would have wondered much; how much greater, then, is my surprise, when I find in it no mention whatever made of him who, above all others, behooved to be present in the Council, that by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of all the Numidian churches this question of the order of the primacy might be debated before any other!</p>

<p>2. For these reasons, I might even hesitate to come to the Council, lest the summons in which so many flagrant mistakes are found should be a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>; even were I not hindered both by the shortness of the notice, and manifold other important engagements standing in the way. I therefore beg you, most blessed prelate, to excuse me, and to be pleased to give attention, in the first instance, to bring about between your Holiness and the aged Xantippus a cordial mutual understanding as to the question which of you ought to summon the Council; or at least, as I think would be still better, let both of you, without prejudging the claim of either, conjointly call together our colleagues, especially those who have been nearly as long in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> as yourselves, who may easily discover and decide which of you has <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> on his side,  that this question may be settled first among a few of you; and then, when the mistake has been rectified, let the younger <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> be gathered together, who, having no others whom it would be either possible or right for them to accept as witnesses in this matter but yourselves, are meanwhile at a loss to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to which of you the preference is to be given.</p>

<p>I have sent this letter sealed with a ring which represents a man's profile.</p>
