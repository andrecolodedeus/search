<h1>Letter 60</h1>

<p> <em>To Adelphius , Bishop and Confessor: against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>.</em></p>

<p>We have read what your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> has written to us, and genuinely approve your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And above all we glorify <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who has given you such <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> as not only to have right opinions, but also, so far as that is possible, not to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the devices <span class="stiki" id="note284739"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse11">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. But we marvel at the perversity of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, seeing that they have fallen into such a pit of impiety that they no longer retain even their senses, but have their understanding corrupted on all sides. But this attempt is a plot of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and an imitation of the disobedient <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. For as the latter, when refuted on all sides, kept devising excuses to their own hurt, if only they could deny the Lord and bring upon themselves what was prophesied against them, in like manner these men, seeing themselves proscribed on all hands, and perceiving that their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has become abominable to all, prove themselves 'inventors of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things <span class="stiki" id="note284740"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse30">Romans&nbsp;1:30</a></span>,' in order that, not ceasing their fightings against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they may remain consistent and genuine adversaries of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For whence has this new mischief of theirs sprung forth? How have they even ventured to utter this new <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> against the Saviour? But the impious man, it seems, is a worthless object, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> 'reprobate concerning the Faith <span class="stiki" id="note284741"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:8</a></span>.' For formerly, while denying the Godhead of the only-begotten <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, they pretended at any rate to acknowledge His coming in the Flesh. But now, gradually going from bad to worse, they have fallen from this opinion of theirs, and become Godless on all hands, so as neither to acknowledge Him as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He has become man. For if they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> this they would not have uttered such things as your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> has reported against them.</p>

<p>2. You, however, beloved and most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> longed-for, have done what befitted the tradition of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward the Lord, in refuting, admonishing, and rebuking such men. But since, instigated by their father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, 'they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not nor understood,' as it is written, 'but go on still in darkness ,' let them learn from your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of theirs belongs to <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, and to Manich&aelig;us, of whom some substituted [the idea of] Appearance for Reality, while the others, dividing what is indivisible, denied the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> that 'the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us <span class="stiki" id="note284743"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span>.' Why then, as they hold with those people, do they not also take up the heritage of their names? For it is reasonable, as they hold their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, to have their names as well, and for the future to be called <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinians</a>, <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionists</a>, and <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a>. Perhaps even thus, being put to shame by the ill savour of the names, they may be enabled to perceive into what a depth of impiety they have fallen. And it would be within our rights not to answer them at all, according to the apostolic advice <span class="stiki" id="note284744"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse10">Titus&nbsp;3:10-11</a></span>: 'A man that is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>, after a first and second admonition refuse, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that such an one is perverted, and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, being self-condemned;' the more so, in that the Prophet says about such men: 'The fool shall utter foolishness, and his heart shall <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> vain things. ' But since, like their leader, they too go about like lions seeking whom among the simple they shall devour <span class="stiki" id="note284746"><a href="../bible/1pe005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;5:8</a></span>, we are compelled to write in reply to your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, that the brethren being once again instructed by your admonition may still further reprobate the vain teaching of those men.</p>

<p>3. We do not worship a creature. Far be the thought. For such an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> belongs to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> and <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>. But we worship the Lord of Creation, Incarnate, the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a>. For if the flesh also is in itself a part of the created world, yet it has become God's body. And we neither divide the body, being such, from the Word, and worship it by itself , nor when we wish to worship the Word do we set Him far apart from the Flesh, but <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, as we said above, that 'the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word</a> was <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">made flesh</a>,' we recognise Him as God also, after having come in the flesh. Who, accordingly, is so senseless as to say to the Lord: 'Leave the Body that I may worship You;' or so impious as to join the senseless <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in saying, on account of the Body, 'Why do You, being a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, make Yourself God <span class="stiki" id="note284748"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;10:33</a></span>?' But the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leper</a> was not one of this sort, for he worshipped God in the Body, and recognised that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, 'Lord, if You will You can make me clean <span class="stiki" id="note284749"><a href="../bible/mat008.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;8:2</a></span>.' Neither by reason of the Flesh did he think the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> a creature: nor because the Word was the maker of all creation did he despise the Flesh which He had put on. But he worshipped the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> as dwelling in a created temple, and was cleansed. So also the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> with an issue of blood, who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and only touched the hem of His garment, was healed <span class="stiki" id="note284750"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;9:20</a></span>, and the sea with its foaming waves heard the incarnate Word, and ceased its storm , while the man blind from birth was healed by the fleshly spitting of the Word. <span class="stiki" id="note284752"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;9:6</a></span> And, what is greater and more startling (for perhaps this even offended those most impious men), even when the Lord was hanging upon the actual cross (for it was His Body and the Word was in it), the sun was darkened and the earth shook, the rocks were rent, and the veil of the temple rent, and many bodies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> which slept arose.</p>

<p>4. These things then happened, and no one <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> now venture to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, whether one is to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the incarnate Word; but even from beholding the man, they recognised that He was their maker, and when they heard a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice, they did not, because it was <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, say that the Word was a creature. On the contrary, they trembled, and recognised nothing less than that it was being uttered from a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Temple. How then can the impious fail to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest 'as they refused to have God in their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, they may be given up to a reprobate <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to do those things which are not fitting <span class="stiki" id="note284753"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;1:28</a></span>?' For Creation does not worship a creature. Nor again did she on account of His Flesh refuse to worship her Lord. But she beheld her maker in the Body, and 'in the <a href="../cathen/07421a.htm">Name of Jesus</a> every knee' bowed, yea and 'shall bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, and every tongue shall confess,' whether the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> approve or no, 'that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> is Lord, to the Glory of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father <span class="stiki" id="note284754"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse10">Philippians&nbsp;2:10-11</a></span>.' For the Flesh did not diminish the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Word; far be the thought: on the contrary, it was <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by Him. Nor, because the Son that was in the form of God took upon Him the form of a servant  was He deprived of His Godhead. On the contrary, He is thus become the Deliverer of all flesh and of all creation. And if God sent His Son brought forth from a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, the fact causes us no shame but contrariwise <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and great <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. For He has become Man, that He might deify us in Himself, and He has been born of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and begotten of a Virgin, in order to transfer to Himself our erring generation , and that we may become henceforth a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> race, and 'partakers of the Divine Nature,' as blessed Peter wrote. <span class="stiki" id="note284757"><a href="../bible/2pe001.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:4</a></span> And 'what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, condemned <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the flesh <span class="stiki" id="note284758"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3</a></span>.'</p>

<p>5. Seeing then that Flesh was taken by the Word to deliver all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, raise all from the dead, and make redemption for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, must not they appear ungrateful, and be worthy of all <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, who make light of the Flesh, as well as those who on account of it charge the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> with being a thing created or made? For they as good as cry to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and say: 'Send not Your Only-begotten Son in the Flesh, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> Him not to take flesh of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a>, lest He redeem us from death and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. We do not wish Him to come in the body, lest He should undergo death on our behalf: we do not desire the Word to be made flesh, lest in it He should become our Mediator to gain access to you, and we so inhabit the heavenly mansions. Let the gates of the heavens be shut lest Your Word consecrate for us the road there through the veil, namely His Flesh <span class="stiki" id="note284759"><a href="../bible/heb010.htm#verse20">Hebrews&nbsp;10:20</a></span>.' These are their utterances, vented with diabolical daring, by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> they have devised. For they who do not wish to worship the Word made flesh, are ungrateful for His becoming man. And they who divide the Word from the Flesh do not hold that one redemption from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has taken place, or one destruction of death. But where at all will these impious men find the Flesh which the Saviour took, apart from Him, that they should even venture to say 'we do not worship the Lord with the Flesh, but we separate the Body, and worship Him alone.' Why, the blessed Stephen saw in the heavens the Lord standing on [God's] right hand <span class="stiki" id="note284760"><a href="../bible/act007.htm#verse55">Acts&nbsp;7:55</a></span>, while the Angels said to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, 'He shall so come in like manner as you beheld Him going into heaven :' and the Lord Himself says, addressing the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, 'I will that where I am, they also may be with Me <span class="stiki" id="note284762"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse24">John&nbsp;17:24</a></span>.' And surely if the Flesh is inseparable from the Word, does it not follow that these men must either lay aside their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and for the future worship the Father in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, or, if they do not worship or serve the Word Who came in the Flesh, be cast out on all sides, and count no longer as <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> but either as <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, or among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.</p>

<p>6. Such then, as we have above described, is the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> and daring of those men. But our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is right, and starts from the teaching of the Apostles and tradition of the fathers, being confirmed both by the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> and the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old</a>. For the Prophets say: 'Send out Your Word and Your Truth ,' and 'Behold the Virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call His name <a href="../cathen/05404a.htm">Emmanuel</a>, which is being interpreted God with us. ' But what does that mean, if not that God has come in the Flesh? While the Apostolic tradition teaches in the words of blessed Peter, 'Forasmuch then as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> suffered for us in the Flesh;' and in what <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> writes, 'Looking for the blessed hope and appearing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ</a>, Who gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a people for His own possession, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> of good works <span class="stiki" id="note284765"><a href="../bible/tit002.htm#verse13">Titus&nbsp;2:13-14</a></span>.' How then has He given Himself, if He had not worn flesh? For flesh He offered, and gave Himself for us, in order that undergoing death in it, 'He might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284766"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;2:14</a></span>.' Hence also we always give thanks in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and we do not set at nought the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> which came to us through Him. For the coming of the Saviour in the flesh has been the ransom and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all creation. So then, beloved and most longed-for, let what I have said put in mind those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord, while as to those who have imitated the behaviour of <a href="../cathen/08539a.htm">Judas</a>, and deserted the Lord to join <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, let them by these things be taught better, if maybe they are willing, if maybe they are ashamed. And let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in worshipping the Lord in the flesh we do not worship a creature, but, as we said above, the Creator Who has put on the created body.</p>

<p>7. But we should like your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to ask them this. When <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> was ordered to go up to Jerusalem to worship at the temple of the Lord, where was the ark, 'and above it the Cherubim of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> overshadowing the Mercy-seat <span class="stiki" id="note284767"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse5">Hebrews 9:5</a></span>,' did they do well or the opposite? If they did ill, how came it that they who despised this law were liable to punishment? For it is written that if a man make light of it and go not up, he shall perish from among the people.  But if they did well, and in this proved well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are not the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, abominable and most shameful of any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, many times worthy of destruction, in that while they approve the former People for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> paid by them to the Temple, they will not worship the Lord Who is in the flesh as in a temple? And yet the former temple was constructed of stones and gold, as a shadow. But when the reality came, the type ceased from thenceforth, and there did not remain, according to the Lord's utterance, one stone upon another that was not broken down. <span class="stiki" id="note284769"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;24:2</a></span> And they did not, when they saw the temple of stones, suppose that the Lord who spoke in the temple was a creature; nor did they set the Temple at nought and retire far off to worship. But they came to it according to the Law, and worshipped the God who uttered His oracles from the Temple. Since then this was so, how can it be other than right to worship the Body of the Lord, all-<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and all-reverend as it is, announced as it was by the archangel Gabriel, formed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and made the Vesture of the Word? It was at any rate a bodily hand that the Word stretched out to raise her that was sick of a fever <span class="stiki" id="note284770"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse31">Mark&nbsp;1:31</a></span>: a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice that He uttered to raise Lazarus from the dead <span class="stiki" id="note284771"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;11:43</a></span>; and, once again, stretching out His hands upon the Cross, He overthrew the prince of the power of the air, that now works  in the sons of disobedience, and made the way clear for us into the heavens.</p>

<p>8. Therefore he that dishonours the Temple dishonours the Lord in the Temple; and he that separates the Word from the Body sets at nought the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> given to us in Him. And let not the most impious <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> madmen suppose that, since the Body is created, the Word also is a creature, nor let them, because the Word is not a creature, disparage His Body. For their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is matter for wonder, in that they at once confuse and disturb everything, and devise pretexts only in order to number the Creator among the creatures.</p>

<p>But let them listen. If the Word were a creature, He would not assume the created body to quicken it. For what help can creatures derive from a creature that itself needs <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? But since the Word being Creator has Himself made the creatures, therefore also at the consummation of the ages <span class="stiki" id="note284773"><a href="../bible/heb009.htm#verse26">Hebrews&nbsp;9:26</a></span> He put on the creature, that He as creator might once more consecrate it, and be able to recover it. But a creature could never be saved by a creature, any more than the creatures were created by a creature, if the Word was not creator. Accordingly let them not lie against the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> nor give offense to simple brethren; but if they are willing let them change their mind in their turn, and no longer worship the creature instead of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who made all things. But if they wish to abide by their impieties, let them alone take their fill of them, and let them gnash their teeth like their father the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, because the Faith of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> is creator and maker of all things; and we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that while 'in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God <span class="stiki" id="note284774"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;1:1</a></span>,' now that He has become also man for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> we worship Him, not as though He had come in the body equalising Himself with it, but as Master, assuming the form of the servant, and Maker and Creator coming in a creature in order that, in it delivering all things, He might bring the world near to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and make all things to be at peace, things in heaven and things on the earth. For thus also we recognise His Godhead, even the Father's, and worship His Incarnate Presence, even if the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> madmen burst themselves in sunder.</p>

<p>Greet all that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>. We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you may be well, and remember us to the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, beloved and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> most longed-for. If need be this is to be read to Hieracas  the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>.</p>
