<h1>Letter 60 (A.D. 401)</h1>

<p> <em>To Father Aurelius, My Lord Most Blessed, and Revered with Most Justly Merited Respect, My Brother in the Priesthood, Most Sincerely Beloved, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. I have received no letter from your Holiness since we parted; but I have now read a letter of your Grace concerning Donatus and his brother, and I have long hesitated as to the reply which I ought to give. After frequently reconsidering what is in such a case conducive to the welfare of those whom we serve in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and seek to nourish in Him, nothing has occurred to me which would alter my opinion that it is not right to give occasion for God's servants to think that promotion to a better position is more readily given to those who have become worse. Such a rule would make <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> less careful of falling, and a most grievous wrong would be done to the order of <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, if those who have deserted their duty as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> be chosen to serve as <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, seeing that our custom is to select for that office only the more tried and superior men of those who continue faithful to their calling as <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>; unless, perchance, the common people are to be taught to joke at our expense, saying <q>a bad <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> makes a good clerk,</q> as they are wont to say that <q>a poor flute-player makes a good singer.</q> It would be an intolerable calamity if we were to encourage the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to such fatal <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and were to consent to brand with so grievous disgrace the clerical order to which we ourselves belong: seeing that sometimes even a good <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> is scarcely qualified to be a good clerk; for though he be proficient in self-denial, he may lack the necessary instruction, or be disqualified by some personal defect.</p>

<p>2. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, however, that your Holiness understood these <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to have left the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with my consent, in order that they might rather be useful to the people of their own district; but this was not the case: of their own accord they departed, of their own accord they deserted us, notwithstanding my resisting, from a regard to their welfare, to the utmost of my power. As to Donatus, seeing that he has obtained ordination before we could arrive at any decision in the Council  as to his case, do as your wisdom may guide you; it may be that his <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> obstinacy has been subdued. But as to his brother, who was the chief <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of Donatus leaving the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what to write, since you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what I think of him. I do not presume to oppose what may seem best to one of your wisdom, rank, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>; and I hope with all my heart that you will do whatever you judge most profitable for the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
