<h1>Letter 61</h1>

<p><strong>To Vigilantius</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Vigilantius on his return to the West after his visit to Jerusalem (whither he had gone as the bearer of letters from Paulinus of Nola&mdash; see Letter LVIII. &sect;11.) had openly accused Jerome of a leaning to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. Jerome now writes to him in the most severe tone repudiating the charge of Origenism and fastening upon his opponent those of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>. He singles out for special reprobation Vigilantius's explanation of 'the stone cut out without hands' in Daniel and urges him to repent of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in which case he will have as much chance of forgiveness as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has according to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>! The letter is often referred to as showing Jerome's way of dealing with <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works. Jerome subsequently wrote a refutation of Vigilantius's work, of all his controversial writings the most violent and the least reasonable. See the translation of it in this volume. See also Letter CIX. The date of this letter is 396 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. Since you have refused to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> your own ears, I might <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> decline to satisfy you by a letter; for, if you have failed to credit the living voice, it is not likely that you will give way to a written paper. But, since Christ has shown us in Himself a pattern of perfect humility, bestowing a <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> upon His betrayer and receiving the robber's repentance upon the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, I tell you now when absent as I have told you already when present, that I read and have read <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> only as I read <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, or other writers whose books in some things the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not receive. I by no means say that everything contained in such books is to be condemned, but I admit that there are things in them deserving of censure. Still, as it is my task and study by reading many authors to cull different flowers from as large a number as possible, not so much making it an object to prove all things as to choose what are good. I take up many writers that from the many I may learn many things; according to that which is written <q>reading all things, holding fast those that are good.</q>  Hence I am much surprised that you have tried to fasten upon me the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, of whose mistaken teaching on many points you are up to the present altogether unaware. Am I a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>? Why <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> then do <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> dislike me so? And are you <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>, you who either against your convictions and the words of your own mouth signed  unwillingly and are consequently a prevaricator, or else signed deliberately and are consequently a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>? You have taken no account of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; you have relinquished all those provinces where numbers plead freely and openly for your <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; and you have singled out me for assault, me who not only censure but publicly condemn all doctrines that are contrary to the church.</p>

<p>2. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but what does that take from me who do not deny that on very many points he is <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a>? He has erred concerning the resurrection of the body, he has erred concerning the condition of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, he has erred by supposing it possible that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> may repent, and&mdash; an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> more important than these&mdash; he has declared in his commentary upon Isaiah that the Seraphim mentioned by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>  are the divine Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. If I did not allow that he has erred or if I did not daily <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematize</a> his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> I should be partaker of his fault. For while we receive what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in his writings we must on no account bind ourselves to accept also what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Still in many passages he has interpreted the scriptures well, has explained obscure places in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and has brought to light very great <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, both in the old and in the new testament. If then I have taken over what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in him and have either cut away or altered or ignored what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, am I to be regarded as guilty on the score that through my agency those who read Latin receive the good in his writings without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> anything of the bad? If this be a crime the confessor Hilary must be convicted; for he has rendered from Greek into Latin <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <em>Explanation</em> of the Psalms and his <em>Homilies</em> on Job. Eusebius of Vercell&aelig;, who witnessed a like confession, must also be held in fault; for he has translated into our tongue the <em>Commentaries</em> upon all the Psalms of his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> namesake, omitting however the unsound portions and rendering only those parts which are profitable. I say nothing of Victorinus of Petavium and others who have merely followed and expanded <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in their explanation of the scriptures. Were I to do so, I might seem less anxious to defend myself than to find for myself companions in guilt. I will come to your own case: Why do you keep copies of his treatises on Job? In these, while arguing against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and concerning the stars and heavens, he has said certain things which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not receive. Is it for you alone, with that very wise head of yours, to pass sentence upon all writers Greek and Latin, with a wave of your censor's wand to eject some from our <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">libraries</a> and to admit others, and as the whim takes you to pronounce me either a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> or a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>? And am I to be forbidden to reject things which are wrong and to condemn what I have often condemned already? Read what I have written upon the epistle to the Ephesians, read my other works, particularly my commentary upon Ecclesiastes, and you will clearly see that from my youth up I have never been terrified by any man's influence into acquiescence in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> pravity.</p>

<p>3. It is no small gain to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your own <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. It is a man's wisdom to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own measure, that he may not be led away at the instigation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to make the whole world a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of his incapacity. You are bent, I suppose, on magnifying yourself and boast in your own country that I found myself unable to answer your eloquence and that I dreaded in you the sharp satire of a Chrysippus.  <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> modesty holds me back and I do not wish to lay open the retirement of my poor cell with biting words. Otherwise I should soon show up all your <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">bravery</a> and your parade of triumph.  But these I leave to others either to talk of or to laugh at; while for my own part as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> speaking to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> I beseech you my brother not to pretend to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> more than you do, lest your pen may proclaim your innocence and simplicity, or at any rate those qualities of which I say nothing but which, though you do not see them in yourself others see in you. For then you will give everyone reason to laugh at your folly. From your earliest childhood you have been taught other lessons and have been used to a different kind of schooling. One and the same person can hardly be a tester both of gold coins on the counter and also of the scriptures, or be a connoisseur of wines and an adept in expounding <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> or <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>.  As for me, you tear me limb from limb, our reverend brother Oceanus you charge with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, you dislike the judgment of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> Vincent and Paulinian, and our brother Eusebius also displeases you. You alone are to be our Cato, the most eloquent of the Roman race, and you wish us to accept what you say as the words of <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a> herself. Pray call to mind the day when I preached on the resurrection and on the reality of the risen body, and when you jumped up beside me and clapped your hands and stamped your feet and applauded my <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. Now, however, that you have taken to sea travelling the stench of the bilge water has affected your head, and you have called me to mind only as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. What can I do for you? I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the letters of the reverend <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Paulinus, and it did not occur to me that his judgment concerning you could be wrong. And although, the moment that you handed me the letter, I noticed a certain incoherency in your language, yet I fancied this due to want of culture and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> in you and not to an unsettled brain. I do not censure the reverend writer who preferred, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, in writing to me to keep back what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> rather than to accuse in his missive one who was both under his patronage and entrusted with his letter; but I find fault with myself that I have rested in another's judgment rather than my own, and that, while my eyes saw one thing, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> on the evidence of a scrap of paper something else than what I saw.</p>

<p>4. Wherefore cease to worry me and to overwhelm me with your scrolls. Spare at least your money with which you hire secretaries and copyists, employing the same <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to write for you and to applaud you. Possibly their praise is due to the fact that they make a profit out of writing for you. If you wish to exercise your <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, hand yourself over to the teachers of grammar and rhetoric, learn logic, have yourself instructed in the schools of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>; and when you have learned all these things you will perhaps begin to hold your tongue. And yet I am acting foolishly in seeking teachers for one who is competent to teach everyone, and in trying to limit the utterance of one who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to speak yet cannot remain silent. The old Greek proverb is quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <q>A lyre is of no use to an ass.</q>  For my part I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that even your name was given you out of contrariety.  For your whole mind slumbers and you actually snore, so profound is the sleep&mdash; or rather the lethargy&mdash; in which you are plunged. In fact among the other <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> which with <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> lips you have uttered you have dared to say that the mountain in Daniel <span class="stiki" id="note301908"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm#verse34">Daniel&nbsp;2:34,&nbsp;45</a></span> out of which the stone was cut without hands is the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and that the stone is Christ, who having taken a body from Adam (whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> had before connected him with the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>) is born of a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> to separate <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> from the mountain, that is, from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Your tongue deserves to be cut out and torn into fragments. Can any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> explain this image of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> instead of referring it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father Almighty, or defile the ears of the whole world with so frightful an enormity? If your explanation has ever been accepted by any&mdash; I will not say <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> but&mdash; <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> or <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, let your words be regarded as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>. If on the other hand the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> has never yet heard of such an impiety, and if yours has been the first mouth through which he who once said <q>I will be like the Most High</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301909"><a href="../bible/isa014.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;14:14</a></span> has declared that he is the mountain spoken of by Daniel, then repent, put on sackcloth and ashes, and with fast-flowing tears wash away your awful guilt; if so be that this impiety may be forgiven you, and, supposing <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that you may obtain pardon when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself shall obtain it, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> who has never been convicted of greater <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> than that which he has uttered through you. Your insult offered to myself I bear with patience: your impiety towards God I cannot bear. Accordingly I may seem to have been somewhat more acrid in this latter part of my letter than I declared I would be at the outset. Yet having once before repented and asked pardon of me, it is extremely foolish in you again to commit a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for which you must anew do <a href="../cathen/11618b.htm">penance</a>. May Christ give you <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to hear and to hold your peace, to understand and so to speak.</p>
