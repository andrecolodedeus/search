<h1>Letter 61</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki"> <em>St. Ambrose explains his absence from Milan on the arrival of the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a> after his victory over Eugenius</em>,  <em>and after expressing his thankfulness for that success he promises <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the Emperor's will, and while commending his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> urges him to be merciful to the conquered.</em></span> </p>

<p>Ambrose, to the <a href="../cathen/14577d.htm">Emperor Theodosius</a>.</p>

<p>1. You thought, most blessed Emperor, so far as I gathered from your letter, that I kept away from the city of Milan, because I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that your <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was forsaken by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But I was not so wanting in foresight, nor so unmindful in my absence of your <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and merits, as not to anticipate that the aid of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> would be with your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, with which you would rescue the Roman Empire from the cruelty of a barbarian robber, and the dominion of an unworthy usurper.</p>

<p>2. I therefore made haste to return there, as soon as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that he, whom I thought it right to avoid,  was now gone, for I had not deserted the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Milan, entrusted to me by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but avoided the presence of him who had involved himself in sacrilege. I returned, therefore, about the Calends of August, and have resided here since that day. Here, too, O Augustus, your letter found me.</p>

<p>3. Thanks be to our Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who responded to your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and has restored the form of ancient <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>, suffering us to see in our time that which we wonder at in reading the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, namely, such a presence of the divine assistance  in battle, that no mountain heights delayed the course of your approach, no hostile arms were any hindrance.</p>

<p>4. For these mercies you think that I ought to render thanks to the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and being conscious of your merits, I will do so willingly. Certainly that offering will be acceptable to God which is offered in your name, and what a mark of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and devotion is this! Other emperors, immediately upon a victory, order the erection of triumphal arches, or other monuments of their triumphs; your Clemency prepares an offering for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and desires that oblation and thanksgiving should be presented by the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</p>

<p>5. Though I be unworthy and unequal to such an office and the offering of such acknowledgments, yet will I describe what I have done. I took the letter of your Piety with me to the altar. I laid it upon the altar. I held it in my hand while I offered the Sacrifice; so that your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might speak by my voice, and the Emperor's letter discharge the function of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> oblation.</p>

<p>6. In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the Lord is propitious to the Roman Empire, since He has chosen such a prince and father of princes, whose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and power, established on such a triumphant height of dominion, rests on such humility, that in valour he has surpassed emperors and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> in humility. What can I wish? What can I desire? You have everything, and therefore I will endeavour to gain the sum of my desires. You, O Emperor, are pitiful, and of the greatest clemency.</p>

<p>7. And for yourself, I desire again and again an increase of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, than which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has given nothing more excellent, that by your clemency the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, as it delights in the peace and tranquillity of the innocent, so, too, may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the pardon of the guilty. Pardon especially those who have not offended before. May the Lord preserve your Clemency. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>
