<h1>Letter 61 (A.D. 401)</h1>

<p> <em>To His well-Beloved and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Brother Theodorus, Bishop Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. I have resolved to commit to writing in this letter what I said when you and I were conversing together as to the terms on which we would welcome <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of the party of Donatus desiring to become <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, in order that, if any one asked you what are our sentiments and practice in regard to this, you might exhibit these by producing what I have written with my own hand. Be assured, therefore, that we detest nothing in the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> but that which renders them schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, namely, their dissent from the unity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in their not remaining in peace with the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is spread abroad throughout the world, and in their refusing to recognise the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ in those who have received it. This their grievous <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, therefore, we reject; but the good name of God which they bear, and His sacrament which they have received, we acknowledge in them, and embrace it with reverence and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But for this very reason we grieve over their wandering, and long to gain them for God by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that they may have within the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sacrament for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which they meanwhile have beyond the pale of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for their destruction. If, therefore, there be taken away from between us the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things which proceed from men, and if the good which comes from God and belongs to both parties in common be duly honoured, there will ensue such brotherly concord, such amiable peace, that the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ shall gain the victory in men's hearts over the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>2. When, therefore, any come to us from the party of Donatus, we do not welcome the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which belongs to them, viz. their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>: these, the only obstacles to our concord, are removed from between us, and we embrace our brethren, standing with them, as the apostle says, in <q>the unity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, in the bond of peace,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111860"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> and acknowledging in them the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which are divine, as their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the blessing conferred by ordination, their profession of self-denial, their vow of celibacy, their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the Trinity, and such like; all which things were indeed theirs before, but <q>profited them nothing, because they had not charity.</q> For what <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is there in the profession of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity by him who does not embrace <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> unity? When, therefore, they come to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they gain thereby not what they already possessed, but something which they had not before&mdash;namely, that those things which they possessed begin then to be profitable to them. For in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they obtain the root of charity in the bond of peace and in the fellowship of unity: so that all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which they hold serve not to condemn, but to deliver them. The branches ought not to boast that their wood is the wood of the vine, not of the thorn; for if they do not live by union to the root, they shall, notwithstanding their outward appearance, be cast into the fire. But of some branches which were broken off the apostle says that <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to graft them in again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111861"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;11:23</a></span> Wherefore, beloved brother, if you see any one of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> party in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> as to the place into which they shall be welcomed by us, show them this writing in my own hand, which is familiar to you, and let them have it to read if they desire it; for <q>I call God for a record upon my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>,</q> that I will welcome them on such terms as that they shall retain not only the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ which they have received, but also the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> due to their vow of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and to their self-denying <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>
