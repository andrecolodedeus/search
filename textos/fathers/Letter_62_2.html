<h1>Letter 62</h1>

<p><strong>To Tranquillinus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Tranquillinus, one of Jerome's Roman friends, had written (1) to tell him of the stand that Oceanus was making against the Origenists at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and (2) to ask whether any parts of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works might be studied with safety and profit. Jerome welcomes the tidings about Oceanus and answers the question of Tranquillinus in the affirmative. He classes <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> with <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> and others whose works continued to be read in spite of their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. Written in 396 or 397 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. Though I formerly <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> the fact, I have now <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the links which bind spirit to spirit are stronger than any physical bond. For you, my reverend friend, cling to me with all your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and I am united to you by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I speak simply and sincerely to your spotless heart: the very paper on which you write, the very letters which you have formed&mdash; voiceless though they are&mdash; inspire in me a sense of your affection.</p>

<p>2. You tell me that many have been deceived by the mistaken teaching of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, and that that saintly man, my son Oceanus, is doing battle with their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>. I grieve to think that simple folk have been thrown off their balance, but I am rejoiced to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that one so learned as Oceanus is doing his best to set them right again. Moreover you ask me, insignificant though I am, for an opinion as to the advisability of reading <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works. Are we, you say, to reject him altogether with our brother Faustinus, or are we, as others tell us, to read him in part? My opinion is that we should sometimes read him for his learning just as we read <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>, Novatus, Arnobius, Apollinarius and some other church writers both Greek and Latin, and that we should select what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> and avoid what is bad in their writings according to the words of the Apostle, <q>Prove all things: hold fast that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301910"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> Those, however, who are led by some perversity in their dispositions to conceive for him too much fondness or too much aversion seem to me to lie under the curse of the Prophet:&mdash; <q>Woe unto them that call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> good and good <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301911"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;5:20</a></span> For while the ability of his teaching must not lead us to embrace his wrong opinions, the wrongness of his opinions should not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us altogether to reject the useful commentaries which he has published on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures. But if his admirers and his detractors are bent on having a tug of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> one against the other, and if, seeking no mean and observing no moderation, they must either approve or disapprove his works indiscriminately, I would choose rather to be a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> boor than a learned blasphemer. Our reverend brother, <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a> the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, heartily salutes you.</p>
