<h1>Letter 63</h1>

<p> <em>Letter to the Presbyter Palladius </em>.</p>

<p>To our beloved son Palladius, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, Athanasius the Bishop greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>I was glad to receive also the letter written by you alone, the more so that you breathe <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> in it, as is your wont. And having learned not for the first time, but long ago, the reason of your staying at present with our beloved Innocent , I am pleased with your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. Since then you are acting as you are, write and let me <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how are the brethren there, and what the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> think about us. But whereas you have also told me of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> at C&aelig;sarea, and I have learned from our beloved Dianius  that they are vexed, and are opposing our beloved <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Basil, I am glad you have informed me, and I have pointed out  to them what is fitting, namely that as children they should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> their father, and not oppose what he approves. For if he were suspected as touching the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they would do well to combat him. But if they are confident, as we all are, that he is a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, contending rather on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and teaching those who require it, it is not right to combat such an one, but rather to accept with thanks his good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. For from what the beloved Dianius has related, they appear to be vexed without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. For he, as I am confident, to the weak becomes weak to gain the weak. <span class="stiki" id="note284803"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:22</a></span> But let our beloved friends look at the scope of his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and at his special purpose , and glorify the Lord Who has given such a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to Cappadocia as any district must <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to have. And do you, beloved, be good enough to point out to them the duty of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a>, as I write. For this is at once calculated to render them well disposed toward their father, and will preserve peace to the churches. I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that you may be well in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, beloved son.</p>
