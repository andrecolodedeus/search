<h1>Letter 63</h1>

<p><strong>To Theophilus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">When the dispute arose between Jerome and Epiphanius on the one side and Rufinus and John of Jerusalem on the other (see Letter LI.), Theophilus <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, being appealed to by the latter sent the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Isidore to report to him on the matter. Isidore reported against Jerome and consequently Theophilus refused to answer several of his letters. Finally he wrote counselling him to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the canons of the church. Jerome replies that to do this has always been his first object. He then remonstrates with Theophilus on his too great leniency towards the Origenists and declares it to be productive of the worst results. The date of the letter is probably 397 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>Jerome to the most blessed pope  Theophilus.</p>

<p>1. Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> will remember that at the time when you kept silence towards me, I never ceased to do my duty by writing to you, not taking so much into account what you in the exercise of your discretion were then doing as what it became me to do. And now that I have received a letter from your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, I see that my reading of the gospel has not been without fruit. For if the frequent <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> changed the determination of an unyielding judge, <span class="stiki" id="note301913"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse2">Luke&nbsp;18:2-5</a></span> how much more must my constant appeals have softened a fatherly heart like yours?</p>

<p>2. I thank you for your reminder concerning the canons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Truly, <q>whom the Lord loves he chastens, and scourges every son whom he receives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301914"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6</a></span> Still I would assure you that nothing is more my aim than to maintain the rights of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to keep to the lines laid down by the fathers, and always to remember the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of Rome; that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which is praised by the lips of an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note301915"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;1:8</a></span> and of which the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> church boasts to be a sharer.</p>

<p>3. Many religious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are displeased that you are so long-suffering in regard to that shocking <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>,  and that you suppose yourself able by such lenity to amend those who are attacking the Church's vitals. They <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, while you are waiting for the penitence of a few, your action is fostering the boldness of abandoned men and making their party stronger. Farewell in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>
