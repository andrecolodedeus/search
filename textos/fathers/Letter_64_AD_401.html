<h1>Letter 64 (A.D. 401)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Lord Quintianus, My Most Beloved Brother and Fellow-Presbyter, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. We do not disdain to look upon bodies which are defective in beauty, especially seeing that our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> themselves are not yet so beautiful as we hope that they shall be when He who is of ineffable beauty shall have appeared, in whom, though now we see Him not, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; for then <q>we shall be like Him,</q> when <q>we shall see Him as He is.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111865"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> If you receive my counsel in a kindly and brotherly spirit, I exhort you to think thus of your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, as we do of our own, and not presumptuously <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that it is already perfect in beauty; but, as the apostle enjoins, <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in hope,</q> and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the precept which he annexes to this, when he says, <q>Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111866"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;12:12</a></span> <q>for we are saved by hope,</q> as he says again; <q>but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111867"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24-25</a></span> Let not this patience be wanting in you, but with a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> <q>wait on the Lord; be of good <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and He shall strengthen your heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.</q> </p>

<p>2. It is, of course, obvious that if you come to us while debarred from communion with the venerable <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Aurelius, you cannot be admitted to communion with us; but we would act towards you with that same charity which we are assured shall guide his conduct. Your coming to us, however, should not on this account be embarrassing to us, because the duty of submission to this, out of regard to the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ought to be felt by yourself, especially if you have the approval of your own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to yourself and to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For if Aurelius has deferred the examination of your case, he has done this not from dislike to you, but from the pressure of other engagements; and if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> his circumstances as well as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your own, the delay would <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> you neither surprise nor sorrow. That it is the same with myself, I entreat you to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in my word, as you are equally unable to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how I am occupied. But there are other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> older than I am, and both in authority more worthy and in place more convenient, by whose help you may more easily expedite the affairs now pending in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> committed to your charge. I have not, however, failed to make mention of your distress, and of the complaint in your letter to my venerable brother and colleague the aged Aurelius, whom I esteem with the respect due to his worth; I took care to acquaint him with your innocence of the things laid to your charge, by sending him a copy of your letter. It was not until a day, or at the most two, before <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas</a>,  that I received the letter in which you informed me of his intention to visit the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Badesile, by which you <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest the people be disturbed and influenced against you. I do not therefore presume to address by letter your people; for I could write a reply to any who had written to me, but how could I put myself forward unasked to write to a people not committed to my care?</p>

<p>3. Nevertheless, what I now say to you, who alone have written to me, may, through you, reach others who should hear it. I charge you then, in the first place, not to bring the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> into reproach by reading in the public assemblies those writings which the Canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not acknowledged; for by these, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and especially the <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;ans</a> (of whom I hear that some are lurking, not without encouragement, in your district), are accustomed to subvert the minds of the inexperienced. I am amazed that a man of your wisdom should admonish me to forbid the reception into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of those who have come from you to us, in order that a decree of the Council may be <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, and at the same time should forget another decree  of the same Council, declaring what are the canonical Scriptures which ought to be read to the people. Read again the proceedings of the Council, and commit them to memory: you will there find that the Canon which you refer to  as prohibiting the indiscriminate reception of applicants for admission to a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, was not framed in regard to <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>, but applies to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> alone. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> there is no mention of <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> in the canon; but it is laid down in general, that no one may receive a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> belonging to another diocese [except in such a way as upholds the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>]. Moreover, it has been enacted in a recent Council,  that any who desert a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, or are expelled from one, shall not be elsewhere  admitted either to clerical office or to the charge of a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. If, therefore, you are in any measure disturbed regarding Privatio, let me inform you that he has not yet been received by us into the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>; but that I have submitted his case to the aged Aurelius, and will act according to his decision. For it seems strange to me, if a man can be reckoned a Reader who has read only once in public, and on that occasion read writings which are not canonical. If for this reason he is regarded as an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reader, it follows that the writing which he read must be esteemed as sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if the writing be not sanctioned by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as canonical, it follows that, although a man may have read it to a congregation, he is not thereby made an <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> reader, [but is, as before, a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>]. Nevertheless I must, in regard to the young man in question, abide by the decision of the arbiter whom I have named.</p>

<p>4. As to the people of Vigesile, who are to us as well as to you beloved in the bowels of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if they have refused to accept a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who has been deposed by a plenary Council in Africa,  they act wisely, and cannot be compelled to yield, nor ought to be. And whoever shall attempt to compel them by <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to receive him, will show plainly what is his character, and will make men well understand what his real character was at an earlier time, when he would have had them <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of him. For no one more effectually discovers the worthlessness of his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, than the man who, employing the secular power, or any other kind of violent means, endeavours by agitating and complaining to recover the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> rank which he has forfeited. For his desire is not to yield to Christ service which He claims, but to usurp over <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> an authority which they disown. Brethren, be cautious; great is the craft of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but Christ is the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
