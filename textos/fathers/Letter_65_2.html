<h1>Letter 65</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Atarbius</em>. </p>

<p>If I continue to insist on the privileges to which my superior age entitles me, and wait for you to take the initiative in communication ,  and if you, my friend, wish to adhere more persistently to your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsel of inaction, what end will there be to our silence? However, where friendship is involved, to be defeated is in my opinion to win, and so I am quite ready to gave you precedence, and retire from the contest as to which should maintain his own opinion. I have been the first to betake myself to writing, because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <q>charity bears all things...endures all things...seeks not her own</q> and so <q>never fails.</q>  He who subjects himself to his neighbour in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> can never be humiliated. I do beg you, then, at all events for the future, show the first and greatest fruit of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, Love;  away with the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> man's sullenness which you are showing me by your silence, and recover <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in your heart, peace with the brothers who are of one mind with you, and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and anxiety for the continued safety of the Churches of the Lord. If I were not to make as strenuous efforts on behalf of the Churches as the opponents of sound doctrine make to subvert and utterly destroy them, you may be quite sure that there is nothing to prevent the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from being swept away and destroyed by its enemies, and my being involved in the condemnation, for not showing all possible anxiety for the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, with all <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and eagerness in mutual unanimity and godly agreement. I exhort you then, drive out of your mind the idea that you need communion with no one else. To cut one's self off from connection with the brethren is not the mark of one who is walking by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, nor yet the fulfilling of the commandment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. At the same time I do wish you, with all your good intentions, to take into account that the calamities of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> which are now all round about us  may one day be at our own doors, and if we too, like all the rest, have our share of outrage, we shall not find any even to sympathise with us, because in the hour of our prosperity we refused to give our share of sympathy to the wronged.</p>
