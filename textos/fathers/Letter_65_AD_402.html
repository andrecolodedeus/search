<h1>Letter 65 (A.D. 402)</h1>

<p> <em>To the Aged</em>  <em>Xantippus, My Lord Most Blessed and Worthy of Veneration, and My Father and Colleague in the Priestly Office, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. Saluting your Excellency with the respect due to your worth, and earnestly seeking an interest in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, I beg to submit to the consideration of your wisdom the case of a certain Abundantius, ordained a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> in the domain of Strabonia, belonging to my diocese. He had begun to be unfavourably reported of, through his not walking in the way which becomes the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and I being on this account alarmed, though not believing the rumours without examination, was made more watchful of his conduct, and devoted some pains to obtain, if possible, indisputable evidences of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> courses with which he was charged. The first thing which I ascertained was, that he had embezzled the money of a countryman, entrusted to him for religious purposes, and could give no satisfactory account of his stewardship. The next thing <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> against him, and admitted by his own confession, was, that on <a href="../cathen/03724b.htm">Christmas day</a>, on which the fast was observed by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Gippe as by all the other Churches, after taking leave of his colleague the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Gippe, as if going to his own church about 11 A.M., he remained, without having any ecclesiastic in his company, in the same parish, and dined, supped, and spent the night in the house of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of ill fame. It happened that lodging in the same place was one of our <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Hippo, who had gone there; and as the facts were <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> beyond dispute to this <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, Abundantius could not deny the charge. As to the things which he did deny, I left them to the divine tribunal, passing sentence upon him only in regard to those things which he had not been permitted to conceal. I was afraid to leave him in charge of a Church, especially of one placed as his was, in the very midst of rabid and barking <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. And when he begged me to give him a letter with a statement of his case to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of the parish of Armema, in the district of Bulla, from which he had come to us, so as to prevent any exaggerated suspicion there of his character, and in order that he might there live, if possible, a more consistent life, having no duties as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, I was moved by compassion to do as he desired. At the same time, it was very specially incumbent on me to submit to your wisdom these facts, lest any deception should be practised upon you.</p>

<p>2. I pronounced sentence in his case one hundred days before <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> Sunday, which falls this year on the 7th of April. I have taken care to acquaint you with the date, because of the decree of Council,  which I also did not conceal from him, but explained to him the law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that if he thought anything could be done to reverse my decision, unless he began proceedings with this view within a year, no one would, after the lapse of that time, listen to his pleading. For my own part, my lord most blessed, and father worthy of all veneration, I assure you that if I did not think that these instances of vicious conversation in an ecclesiastic, especially when accompanied with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, deserved to be visited with the punishment appointed by the Council, I would be compelled now to attempt to sift things which cannot be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and either to condemn the accused upon doubtful evidence, or acquit him for want of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>. When a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, upon a day of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> which was observed as such also in the place in which he was, having taken leave of his colleague in the ministry in that place, and being unattended by any ecclesiastic, ventured to tarry in the house of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of ill fame, and to dine and sup and spend the night there, it seemed to me, whatever others might think, that he behooved to be <a href="../cathen/04737b.htm">deposed</a> from his office, as I dared not commit to his charge a <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. If it should so happen that a different opinion be held by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> judges to whom he may appeal, seeing that it has been decreed by the Council  that the decision of six <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> be final in the case of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, let who will commit to him a Church within his jurisdiction, I confess, for my own part, that I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to entrust any congregation whatever to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> like him, especially when nothing in the way of general good character can be alleged as a reason for excusing these delinquencies; lest, if he were to break forth into some more ruinous <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, I should be compelled with sorrow to blame myself for the harm done by his crime.</p>
