<h1>Letter 66 (A.D. 402)</h1>

<p> <em>Addressed, Without Salutation, to Crispinus, the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> Bishop of Calama.</em></p>

<p>1. You ought to have been influenced by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but since, in your work of rebaptizing the Mappalians,  you have chosen to take advantage of the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> with which as man you could inspire them, let me ask you what hinders the order of the sovereign from being carried out in the province, when the order of the governor of the province has been so fully enforced in a village? If you compare the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> concerned, you are but a vassal in possession; he is the Emperor. If you compare the positions of both, you are in a property, he is on a throne; if you compare the causes maintained by both, his aim is to heal division, and yours is to rend unity in two. But we do not bid you stand in awe of man: though we might take steps to compel you to pay, according to the imperial decree, ten pounds of gold as the penalty of your outrage. Perhaps you might be unable to pay the fine imposed upon those who rebaptize members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, having been involved in so much expense in buying people whom you might compel to submit to the rite. But, as I have said, we do not bid you be afraid of man: rather let Christ fill you with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. I should like to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what answer you could give Him, if He said to you: <q>Crispinus, was it a great price which you paid in order to buy the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the Mappalian peasantry; and does My death, the price paid by Me to purchase the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of all nations, seem little in your eyes? Was the money which was counted out from your purse in acquiring these serfs in order to their being rebaptized, a more costly <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> than the blood which flowed from My side in redeeming the nations in order to their being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>?</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, if you would listen to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, you might hear many more such appeals, and might, even by the possession which you have obtained, be warned how impious are the things which you have spoken against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For if you think that your title to hold what you have bought with money is sure by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> law, how much more sure, by divine law, is Christ's title to that which He has bought with His own blood! And it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that He of whom it is written, <q>He shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth,</q> shall hold with invincible might all which He has purchased; but how can you expect with any assurance to retain that which you think you have made your own by purchase in Africa, when you affirm that Christ has lost the whole world, and been left with Africa alone as His portion?</p>

<p>2. But why multiply words? If these Mappalians have passed of their own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a> into your communion, let them hear both you and me on the question which divides us&mdash;the words of each of us being written down, and translated into the Punic tongue after having been attested by our signatures; and then, all pressure through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of their superior being removed, let these vassals choose what they please. For by the things which we shall say it will be made manifest whether they remain in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> under coercion, or hold what they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with their own consent. They either understand these matters, or they do not: if they do not, how could you dare to transfer them in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> to your communion? And if they do, let them, as I have said, hear both sides, and act freely for themselves. If there be any communities that have passed over from you to us, which you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to have yielded to the pressure of their superiors, let the same be done in their case; let them hear both sides, and choose for themselves. Now, if you reject this proposal, who can fail to be convinced that your reliance is not upon the force of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? But you ought to beware of the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of God both here and hereafter. I <a href="../cathen/01142c.htm">adjure</a> you by Christ to give a reply to what I have written.</p>
