<h1>Letter 67</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Athanasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria</em>.</p>

<p>In my former letter it seemed to me sufficient to point out to your excellency, that all that portion of the people of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">Church of Antioch</a> who are sound in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, ought to be brought to concord and unity. My object was to make it plain that the sections, now divided into several parts, ought to be united under the God-beloved <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Meletius. Now the same beloved <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, Dorotheus, has requested a more distinct statement on these subjects, and I am therefore constrained to point out that it is the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the whole East, and the earnest desire of one who, like myself, is so wholly united to him, to see him in authority over the Churches of the Lord. He is a man of unimpeachable <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; his manner of life is incomparably excellent, he stands at the head, so to say, of the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and all else are mere disjointed members. On every ground, then, it is necessary as well as advantageous, that the rest should be united with him, just as smaller streams with great ones. About the rest,  however, a certain amount of management is needed, befitting their position, and likely to pacify the people. This is in keeping with your own wisdom, and with your famous readiness and energy. It has however by no means escaped your intelligence, that this same course of procedure has already recommended itself to the Westerns who are in agreement with you, as I learn from the letters brought to me by the blessed Silvanus.</p>
