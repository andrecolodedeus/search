<h1>Letter 68</h1>

<p><strong>To Castrutius</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Castrutius, a blind man of Pannonia, had set out for <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> to visit Jerome. However, on reaching Cissa (whether that in Thrace or that on the Adriatic is uncertain) he was induced by his friends to turn back. Jerome writes to thank him for his intention and to console him for his inability to carry it out. He then tries to comfort him in his blindness (1) by referring to Christ's words concerning the man born blind <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse3">John 9:3</a></span> and (2) by telling him the story of Antony and Didymus. The date of the letter is 397 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. My reverend son Heraclius the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> has reported to me that in your eagerness to see me you came as far as Cissa, and that, though a Pannonian and consequently a land animal, you did not quail before the surges of the Adriatic and the dangers of the &AElig;gean and Ionian seas. He tells me that you would have actually accomplished your purpose, had not our brethren with affectionate care held you back. I thank you all the same and regard it as a kindness shown. For in the case of friends one must accept the will for the deed. Enemies often give us the latter, but only sincere attachment can bring us the former. And now that I am writing to you I beseech you do not regard the bodily affliction which has befallen you as due to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. When the Apostles speculated concerning the man that was born blind from the womb and asked our Lord and Saviour: <q>Who did <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, this man or his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, that he was born blind?</q> they were told <q>Neither has this man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> nor his <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note301997"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;9:2-3</a></span> Do we not see numbers of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and men of various opinions rolling in the mire of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, bathed in blood, surpassing wolves in ferocity and kites in rapacity, and for all this the plague does not come near their dwellings?  They are not smitten as other men, and accordingly they wax insolent against God and lift up their faces even to heaven. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> on the other hand that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men are afflicted with sicknesses, miseries, and want, and perhaps they are tempted to say <q>Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</q> Yet immediately they go on to reprove themselves, <q>If I say, I will speak thus; behold I should offend against the generation of your children.</q>  If you suppose that your blindness is caused by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that a disease which physicians are often able to cure is an evidence of God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, you will think Isaac a sinner because he was so wholly sightless that he was deceived into blessing one whom he did not mean to bless. <span class="stiki" id="note302000"><a href="../bible/gen027.htm">Genesis&nbsp;xxvii</a></span> You will charge Jacob with <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, whose vision became so dim that he could not see Ephraim and Manasseh, <span class="stiki" id="note302001"><a href="../bible/gen048.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;48:10</a></span> although with the inner eye and the prophetic spirit he could foresee the distant future and the Christ that was to come of his royal line. <span class="stiki" id="note302002"><a href="../bible/gen049.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;49:10</a></span> Were any of the kings holier than Josiah? Yet he was slain by the sword of the Egyptians. <span class="stiki" id="note302003"><a href="../bible/2ki023.htm#verse29">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;23:29</a></span> Were there ever loftier <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> than Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>? Yet their blood stained the blade of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>. And to say no more of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, did not the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> endure the shame of the cross? And yet you fancy those blessed who enjoy in this world <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and pleasure? God's hottest <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against sinners is when he shows no <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>. Wherefore in Ezekiel he says to Jerusalem: <q>My jealousy will depart from you and I will be quiet and will be no more <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>.</q>  For <q>whom the Lord loves He chastens, and scourges every son whom He receives.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302005"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;12:6</a></span> The father does not instruct his son unless he loves him. The master does not correct his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> unless he sees in him signs of promise. When once the doctor gives over caring for the patient, it is a sign that he despairs. You should answer thus: <q>as Lazarus in his lifetime <span class="stiki" id="note302006"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse25">Luke&nbsp;16:25</a></span> received <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things so will I now gladly suffer torments that future <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may be laid up for me.</q> For <q>affliction shall not rise up the second time.</q>  If Job, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and spotless and righteous in his generation, suffered terrible afflictions, his own book explains the reason why.</p>

<p>2. That I may not make myself tedious or exceed the due limits of a letter by repeating old stories, I will briefly relate to you an incident which happened in my childhood. The saintly Athanasius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria had summoned the blessed Antony to that city to confute the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> there. Hereupon Didymus, a man of great learning who had lost his eyes, came to visit the hermit and, the conversation turning upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures, Antony could not help admiring his ability and eulogizing his insight. At last he said: You do not regret, do you, the loss of your eyes? At first Didymus was ashamed to answer, but when the question had been repeated a second time and a third, he frankly confessed that his blindness was a great grief to him. Whereupon Antony said: <q>I am surprised that a wise man should grieve at the loss of a faculty which he shares with ants and flies and gnats, and not <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> rather in having one of which only <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> have been thought worthy.</q> From this story you may perceive how much better it is to have spiritual than carnal vision and to possess eyes into which the mote of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> cannot fall. <span class="stiki" id="note302008"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse42">Luke&nbsp;6:42</a></span> </p>

<p>Though you have failed to come this year, I do not yet despair of your coming. If the reverend <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>  who is the bearer of this letter is again caught in the toils of your affection, and if you come hither in his company I shall be delighted to welcome you and shall readily acknowledge that the delay in payment is made up for by the largeness of the interest.</p>
