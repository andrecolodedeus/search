<h1>Letter 68</h1>

<p> <em>From Three Gallic Bishops to St. Leo.</em></p>

<p>Ceretius, Salonius and Veranus to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Lord, most blessed father, and pope most worthy of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, Leo.</p>

<h2>I. They congratulate and thank Leo for the Tome.</h2>

<p>Having perused your Excellency's letter, which you composed for instruction in the Faith, and sent to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople, we thought it our duty, being enriched with so great a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> of doctrine, to pay our debt of thanks by at least inditing you a letter. For we appreciate your fatherly solicitude on our behalf, and confess that we are the more indebted to your preventing care because we now have the benefit of the remedy before experiencing the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>. For <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that those remedies are nearly too late which are applied after the infliction of the wounds, you admonish us with the voice of loving forethought to arm ourselves with those Apostolic means of defence. We acknowledge frankly, most blessed pope , with what singular loving-kindness you have imparted to us the innermost thoughts of your breast, by the efficacy of which you secure the safety of others: and while you extract the old Serpent's infused poison from the hearts of others, standing as it were on the watchtower of Love, with Apostolic care and watchfulness you cry aloud, lest the enemy come on us unawares and off our guard, lest careless security expose us to attack, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Lord, most blessed father and pope, most worthy of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>. Moreover we, who specially belong to you , are filled with a great and unspeakable delight, because this special statement of your teaching is so highly regarded wherever the Churches meet together, that the unanimous opinion is expressed that the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> is rightfully there assigned, from whence the oracles of the Apostolic Spirit still receive their interpretations.</p>

<h2>II. They ask him to correct or add to their copy of the Tome.</h2>

<p>Therefore, if you deem it worth while, we entreat your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to run through and correct any mistake of the copyist in this work, so valuable both now and in the future, which we have had committed to parchment , in our desire to preserve it, or if you have devised anything further in your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, which will profit all who read, give orders in your loving care that it be added to this copy, so that not only many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> our brethren throughout the provinces of <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, but also many of your sons among the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, who greatly desire to see this letter for the revelation of the Truth, may be permitted, when it is sent back to us, corrected by your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hand, to transcribe, read and keep it. If you think fit, we are anxious that our messengers should return soon, in order that we may the speedier have an account of your good health over which to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>: for your well-being is our <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and health.</p>

<p>May Christ the Lord long keep your eminence mindful of our humility, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Lord, most blessed father and pope most worthy of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>.</p>

<p> I, Ceretius, your adopted (son?), salute your apostleship, commending me to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.</p>

<p>I, Salonius, your adorer, salute your apostleship, entreating the aid of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.</p>

<p>I, Veranus, the worshipper of your apostleship, salute your blessedness, and beseech you to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for me.</p>
