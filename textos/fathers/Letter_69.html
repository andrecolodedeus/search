<h1>Letter 69</h1>

<p> <em>To Eugraphia.</em> </p>

<p>Had I not been unavoidably prevented, I should no sooner have heard that your great and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> husband had fallen asleep than I should straightway have hurried to your side. I have enjoyed at your hands many and various kinds of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and I owe you full many thanks. When hindered, much against my will, from paying my debt, I deemed it ill-advised to send you a letter at the very moment, when your grief was at its height; when it was impossible for my messenger to approach your excellency, and when grief prevented you from reading what I wrote. But now that your reason has had time to wake from the intoxication of grief, to repress your emotion, and to discipline the license of sorrow, I have made bold to write and to beseech your excellency to bethink you of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, to reflect how common is the loss you deplore, and, above all, to accept the divine teaching, and not let your distress go beyond the bounds of your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For your most excellent husband, as the Lord Himself said, <q>is not dead but sleeps</q> &mdash; a sleep a little longer than he was wont. This hope has been given us by the Lord; this promise we have received from the divine oracles. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> indeed how distressing is the separation, how most distressing; and especially so when affection is made stronger by sympathy of character and length of time. But let your grief be for a journey into a far country, not for a life ended. This kind of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> is particularly becoming to them that be brought up in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and it is of this <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that I beseech you, my respected friend, to seek the adornment. And I do not offer you this advice as a man labouring himself under insensibility; in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> my heart was grieved when I learned of the departure of one I loved so well. But I call to mind the Ruler of the world and His unspeakable wisdom, which ordains everything for our good. I implore your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to take these reflections to heart, to rise superior to your sorrow, and praise God who is the Master of us all. It is with ineffable <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> that He guides the lives of men.</p>
