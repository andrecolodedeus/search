<h1>Letter 69</h1>

<p><strong>To Oceanus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Oceanus, a Roman nobleman <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, had asked Jerome to back him in a protest against Carterius a Spanish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who contrary to the apostolic rule that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is to be <q>the husband of one wife</q> had married a second time. Jerome refuses to take the line suggested on the ground that Carterius's first marriage having preceded his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> cannot be taken into account. He therefore advises Oceanus to let the matter drop. The date of the letter is 397 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. I never supposed, son Oceanus, that the clemency of the Emperor would be assailed by criminals, or that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> just released from <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> would after their own experience of its filth and fetters complain of relaxations allowed to others. In the gospel he who envies another's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is thus addressed: <q>Friend, is your eye <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because I am good?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302010"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;20:15</a></span> <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has concluded them all in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>  that he might have mercy upon all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302012"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse32">Romans&nbsp;11:32</a></span> <q>When <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> abounded <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> did much more abound.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302013"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> The first born of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> are slain and not even a beast belonging to <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> is left behind in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.  The <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the Cainites rises before me and the once slain viper lifts up its shattered head, destroying not partially as most often hitherto but altogether the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  This <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> declares that there are some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which Christ cannot cleanse with His blood, and that the scars left by old transgressions on the body and the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> are sometimes so deep that they cannot be effaced by the remedy which He supplies. What else is this but to say that Christ has died in vain? He has indeed died in vain if there are any whom He cannot make alive. When John the Baptist points to Christ and says: <q>Behold the lamb of God which takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>  of the world</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302017"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> he utters a <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> if after all there are <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> living whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> Christ has not taken away. For either it must be shown that they are not of the world whom the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of Christ thus ignores: or, if it be admitted that they are of the world, we have to choose between the horns of a dilemma. Either they have been delivered from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, in which case the power of Christ to save all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>; or they remain undelivered and as it were still under the charge of misdoing, in which case Christ is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be powerless. But far be it from us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> of the Almighty that He is powerless in anything. For <q>what things soever the Father does, these also does the Son likewise.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302018"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> To ascribe weakness to the Son is to ascribe it to the Father also. The shepherd carries the whole sheep and not only this or that part of it: all the epistles of the apostle  speak continually of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And, lest a single announcement of this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> might seem a little thing, Peter says: <q>Grace unto you and peace be multiplied.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302020"><a href="../bible/1pe001.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;1:2</a></span> The Scripture promises abundance; yet we affirm scarcity.</p>

<p>2. To what does all this tend, you ask. I reply; you remember the question that you proposed. It was this. A Spanish <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> named Carterius, old in years and in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> has married two wives, one before he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and, she having died, another since he has passed through the laver; and you are of opinion that he has violated the precept of the apostle, who in his list of episcopal qualifications commands that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> shall be <q>the husband of one wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302021"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:2</a></span> I am surprised that you have pilloried an individual when the whole world is filled with <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> ordained in similar circumstances; I do not mean <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> or <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of lower rank, but speak only of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of whom if I were to enumerate them all one by one I should gather a sufficient number to surpass the crowd which attended the synod of Ariminum.  Still it does not become me to defend one by incriminating many; nor if reason condemns a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, to make the number of those who commit it an excuse for it. At Rome an eloquent pleader caught me, as the phrase goes, between the horns of a dilemma: whichever way I turned I was held fast. Is it sinful, said he, to marry a wife, or is it not sinful? I in my simplicity, not being wary enough to avoid the snare laid for me, replied that it was not sinful. Then he propounded another question: Is it good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which are done away with in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or is it <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? Here again my simplicity induced me to say that it was <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which were forgiven. At this point, just as I began to fancy myself secure, the horns of the dilemma commenced to close in on me from this side and from that and their points hidden before began to show themselves. If, said he, to marry a wife is not sinful, and if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> forgives <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, all that is not done away with is held over. On the instant a dark mist rose before my eyes as though I had been struck by a strong boxer. Yet recalling the sophism attributed to Chrysippus:  <q>Whether you lie or whether you speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, in either case you lie,</q> I came to myself again and turned upon my opponent with a dilemma of my own. Pray tell me, I said, does <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> make a new man or does it not? He grudgingly admitted that it did. I pursued my advantage by saying, Does it make him wholly new or only partially so? He replied, Wholly. Then I asked, Is there nothing then of the old man held over in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? He assented. Hereupon I propounded the argument; If <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> makes a man new and creates a wholly new being, and if there is nothing of the old man held over in the new, that which once was in the old cannot be imputed to the new. At first my thorny friend held his tongue; afterwards however, making Piso's mistake,  though he had nothing to say he could not remain silent. Sweat stood upon his brow, his cheeks turned pale, his lips trembled, his tongue clove to his mouth, his throat became dry; and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> (not age) made him cower. At last he broke out in these words, Have you not read how the apostle permits none to be ordained <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> save the husband of one wife, and that what he lays stress upon is the fact of the marriage and not the time at which it is contracted? Now as the fellow had challenged me with syllogisms, and as I saw that he was feeling his way towards some intricate and awkward questions, I proceeded to turn his own weapons against him. I said therefore, Whom did the apostle select for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> or <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a>? He refused to reply. I however made a fresh onslaught repeating my question a second time and a third. You would have taken him for Niobe changed to <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> by excessive weeping. I turned to the audience and said: It is all the same to me, good people, whether I bind my opponent awake or sleeping; but it is easier to fetter a man who offers no resistance. If those whom the apostle admits into the ranks of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> are not <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> but the faithful, and if he who is ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is always one of the faithful, being one of the faithful he cannot have the faults of a catechumen imputed to him. Such were the darts I hurled at my paralysed opponent. Such the quivering spears I cast at him. At last his mouth opened and he vomited forth the contents of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. Certainly, he blurted out, that is the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>.</p>

<p>3. Accordingly I bring out two epistles of the apostle, the first to Timothy, and the second to Titus. In the first is the following passage: <q>If a man desire the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> he desires a good work. A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach, not given to wine, no striker...but patient, not a brawler, not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>; one that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity. (For if a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) Not a novice lest being lifted up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> he fall into the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302025"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:1-7</a></span> While immediately at the commencement of the epistle to Titus the following behests are laid down: <q>For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> left I you in Crete that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you: if any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly. For a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be blameless as the steward of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; not self-willed, not soon <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, temperate; holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302026"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse5">Titus&nbsp;1:5-9</a></span> In both epistles commandment is given that only monogamists should be chosen for the clerical office whether as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> or as <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>.  Indeed with the ancients these names were synonymous, one alluding to the office, the other to the age of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. No one at any rate can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the apostle is speaking only of those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. If therefore it in no wise prejudices the case of one who is to be ordained <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that before his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> he has not possessed all the requisite qualifications (for it is asked what he is and not what he has been), why should a previous marriage&mdash; the one thing which is in itself not sinful&mdash; prove a hindrance to his ordination? You argue that as his marriage was not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it was not done away with at his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. This is news to me indeed, that what in itself was not a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is to be reckoned as such. All fornication and contamination with open <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, impiety towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, parricide and incest, the change of the natural use of the sexes into that which is against nature <span class="stiki" id="note302028"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse26">Romans&nbsp;1:26-27</a></span> and all extraordinary <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> are washed away in the fountain of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Can it be possible that the stains of marriage are indelible, and that harlotry is judged more leniently than <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> wedlock? I do not, Carterius might say, hold you to blame for the hosts of mistresses and the troops of favourites  that you have kept; I do not charge you with your bloodshedding and sow-like wallowings in the mire of uncleanness: yet you are ready to drag from her grave for my confusion my poor wife, who has been dead long years, and whom I married that I might be kept from those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> into which you have fallen. Tell this to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> who form the church's harvest with which she stores her granaries; tell this to the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> who seek admission to the number of the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a>; tell them, I say, not to contract marriages before their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, not to enter upon <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> wedlock, but like the Scots and the Atacotti  and the people of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato's</a> republic  to have community of wives and no discrimination of children, nay more, to beware of any semblance even of matrimony; lest, after they have come to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, He shall tell them that those whom they have had have not been concubines or mistresses but wedded wives.</p>

<p>4. Let every man examine his own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> and let him deplore the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> he has done to it at every period of his life; and then when he has brought himself to deliver a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> judgment on his own former misdeeds, let him give ear to the chiding of Jesus: <q>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of your own eye; and then shall you see clearly to cast out the mote out of your brother's eye.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302032"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse5">Matthew&nbsp;7:5</a></span> Truly like the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and pharisees we strain out the gnat and swallow the camel, we pay <a href="../cathen/14741b.htm">tithe</a> of mint and anise, and we omit the just judgment which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> requires.  What parallel can be drawn between a wife and a prostitute? Is it fair to make a marriage now dissolved by death a ground of accusation, while dissolute living wins for itself a garland of praise? He, had his former wife lived, would not have married another; but as for you, how can you defend the bestial unions you indiscriminately make? Perhaps indeed you will say that you feared to contract marriage lest by so doing you might disqualify yourself for ordination. He took a wife that he might have children by her; you by taking a harlot have lost the hope of children. He withdrew into the privacy of his own chamber when he sought to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> nature and to win God's blessing: <q>Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302034"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> You on the contrary outraged public decency in the hot eagerness of your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. He covered a lawful indulgence beneath a veil of modesty; you pursued an unlawful one shamelessly before the eyes of all. For him it is written <q>Marriage is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and the bed undefiled,</q> while to you the words are read, <q>but whoremongers and adulterers God wilt judge,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302035"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> and <q>if any man destroys the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, him shall God destroy.</q>  All iniquities, we are told, are forgiven us at our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and when once we have received God's mercy we need not afterwards dread from Him the severity of a judge. The apostle says:&mdash; <q>And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus</a>, and by the Spirit of our God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302037"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:11</a></span> All <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> then are forgiven; it is an honest and faithful saying. But I ask you, how comes it that, while your uncleanness is washed away, my cleanness is made unclean? You reply, <q>No, it is not made unclean, it remains just what it was. Had it been uncleanness, it would have been washed away like mine.</q> I want to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what you mean by this shuffling. Your remarks seem to have no more point in them than the round end of a pestle. Is a thing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> because it is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Or is a thing unclean because it is not unclean? The Lord, you say, has not forgiven because He had nothing to forgive; yet because He has not forgiven, that which has not been forgiven still remains.</p>

<p>5. What the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> effect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is, and what is the real <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> conveyed by water hallowed in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I will presently tell you; meantime I will deal with this argument as it deserves. 'An ill knot,' says the common proverb, 'requires but an ill wedge to split it.' The text quoted by the objector, <q>a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be the husband of one wife,</q> admits of quite another explanation. The apostle came of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> and the primitive <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> church was gathered out of the remnants of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that the Law allowed men to have children by several wives, <span class="stiki" id="note302038"><a href="../bible/exo021.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;21:10</a></span> and was aware that the example of the patriarchs had made polygamy familiar to the people. Even the very <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> might at their own discretion enjoy the same license. <span class="stiki" id="note302039"><a href="../bible/lev021.htm#verse7">Leviticus&nbsp;21:7,&nbsp;13</a></span> He gave commandment therefore that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the church should not claim this liberty, that they should not take two wives or three together, but that they should each have but one wife at one time. Perhaps you may say that this explanation which I have given is disputed; in that case listen to another. You must not have a monopoly of bending the Law to suit your will instead of bending your will to suit the Law. Some by a strained interpretation say that wives are in this passage to be taken for churches and husbands for their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. A decree was made by the fathers assembled at the council of Nic&aelig;a  that no <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be translated from one church to another, lest scorning the society of a poor yet virgin see he should seek the embraces of a <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and adulterous one. For as the word <span class="greek">&#x03BB;&#x03BF;&#x03B3;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x1F79;&#x03B9;</span>, that is, <q>disputings,</q> refers to the fault and misdoing of sons in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  and as the precept concerning the management of a house refers to the right direction of body and of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302042"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:4</a></span> so by the wives of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> we are to understand their churches. Concerning whom it is written in Isaiah, <q>Make haste ye <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and come from the show, for it is a people of no understanding.</q>  And again <q>Rise up, you <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that are <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>,  and hear my voice.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302045"><a href="../bible/isa032.htm#verse9">Isaiah&nbsp;32:9</a></span> And in the Book of Proverbs, <q>Who can find a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>?

The heart of her husband does safely trust in her.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302046"><a href="../bible/pro031.htm#verse10">Proverbs&nbsp;31:10-11</a></span> In the same book too it is written, <q>Every wise <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> builds her house: but the foolish plucks it down with her hands.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302047"><a href="../bible/pro014.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;14:1</a></span> Nor does this, say they, derogate from the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>; for the same figure is used in relation to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Jeremiah writes: <q>As a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302048"><a href="../bible/jer003.htm#verse20">Jeremiah&nbsp;3:20</a></span> And the apostle employs the same comparison: <q>I have espoused you,</q> he says to his converts, <q>to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302049"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span> The word <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is in the Greek ambiguous and should in all these places be understood as meaning wife. You will say that this interpretation is harsh and does <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to the sense. In that case give back to the scripture its simple meaning and save me from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of fighting you on your own ground.  I will ask you the following question, Can a man who before his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> has kept a concubine, and after her death has received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and has taken a wife, become a <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> or not? You will answer me that he can, because his first partner was a concubine and not a wife. What the apostle condemns then, it would seem, is not mere sexual intercourse but marriage contracts and conjugal rights. Many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, we see, because of narrow circumstances refuse to take upon them the burden of matrimony. Instead of taking wives they live with their maid-servants and bring up as their own the children which these bear to them. Thus, if through the bounty of the Emperor they gain for their mistresses the right of wearing a matron's robes,  they will at once come beneath the yoke of the apostle and sorely against their will will have to receive their partners as their wedded wives. But, if their poverty prevents them from obtaining an imperial rescript such as I have mentioned, the decrees of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> will vary with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Rome. Be careful therefore not to interpret the words <q>the husband of one wife,</q> that is, of one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, as approving indiscriminate intercourse and condemning only contracts of marriage.</p>

<p>I bring forward all these explanations not for the purpose of resisting the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and simple sense of the words in question but to show you that you must take the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures as they are written, and that you must not empty of its efficacy the baptismal rite ordained by the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, or render vain the whole <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the cross.</p>

<p>6. Let me now fulfil the promise I made a little while ago and with all the skill of a rhetorician sing the praises of water and of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. In the beginning the earth was without <a href="../cathen/06137b.htm">form</a> and void, there was no dazzling sun or pale moon, there were no glittering stars. There was nothing but matter inorganic and invisible, and even this was lost in abysmal depths and shrouded in a distorting gloom. The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> above moved, as a charioteer, over the face of the waters, <span class="stiki" id="note302052"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> and produced from them the infant world, a type of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> child that is drawn from the laver of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. A firmament is constructed between heaven and earth, and to this is allotted the name heaven,&mdash; in the Hebrew <em>Shamayim</em> or 'what comes out of the waters,'&mdash; and the waters which are above the heavens are parted from the others to the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Wherefore also in the vision of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel there is seen above the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> a crystal stretched forth, <span class="stiki" id="note302054"><a href="../bible/eze001.htm#verse22">Ezekiel&nbsp;1:22</a></span> that is, the compressed and denser waters. The first living beings come out of the waters; and <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> soar out of the laver with wings to heaven. Man is formed out of clay <span class="stiki" id="note302055"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;2:7</a></span> and God holds the mystic waters in the hollow of his hand.  In <a href="../cathen/14519a.htm">Eden</a> a garden  is planted, and a fountain in the midst of it parts into four heads. <span class="stiki" id="note302058"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;2:8,&nbsp;10</a></span> This is the same fountain which Ezekiel later on describes as issuing out of the temple and flowing towards the rising of the sun, until it heals the bitter waters and quickens those that are dead.  When the world falls into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> nothing but a flood of waters can cleanse it again. But as soon as the foul bird of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is driven away, the dove of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> comes to <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> <span class="stiki" id="note302060"><a href="../bible/gen008.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;8:8,&nbsp;11</a></span> as it came afterwards to Christ in the Jordan, <span class="stiki" id="note302061"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;3:16</a></span> and, carrying in its beak a branch betokening restoration and light, brings tidings of peace to the whole world. <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> and his host, loth to allow God's people to leave <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, are overwhelmed in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a> figuring thereby our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. His destruction is thus described in the book of Psalms: <q>You endowed the sea with <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> through your power: you broke the heads of the dragons in the waters: you broke the heads of leviathan in pieces.</q>  For this reason adders and scorpions haunt dry places <span class="stiki" id="note302063"><a href="../bible/deu008.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;8:15</a></span> and whenever they come near water behave as if rabid or insane.

<p>7. How then can you say that all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are drowned in the baptismal laver if a man's wife is still to swim on the surface as evidence against him? The psalmist says:&mdash; <q>Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputes not iniquity.</q>  It would seem that we must add something to this song and say <q>Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes not a wife.</q> Let us hear also the declaration which Ezekiel the so called <q><a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note302094"><a href="../bible/eze002.htm#verse1">Ezekiel&nbsp;2:1</a></span> makes concerning the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of him who is to be the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">son of man</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>: <q>I will take you,</q> he says, <q>from among the heathen...then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your filthiness...a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit.</q>  <q>From all your filthiness</q> he says, <q>will I cleanse you.</q> If all is taken away nothing can be left.

Time would fail me were I to try to lay before you in order all the passages in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a> which relate to the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or to explain the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> doctrine of that second birth which though it is our second is yet our first in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>8. Before I make an end of dictating (for I perceive that I have already exceeded the just limits of a letter) I wish to give a brief explanation of the previous verses of the epistle in which the apostle describes the life of him that is to be made a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. We shall thus recognize him as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Doctor of the Nations</a>  not only for his praise of monogamy but also for all his precepts. At the same time I beg that no one will suppose that in what I write my design is to blacken the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the present day. My one object is to promote the interest of the church. Just as orators and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> in giving their notions of the perfect orator and the perfect <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> do not detract from Demosthenes and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> but merely set forth abstract ideals; so, when I describe a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and explain the qualifications laid down for the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>, I am but supplying a mirror for <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>. Every man's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> will tell him that it rests with himself what image he will see reflected there, whether one that will grieve him by its deformity or one that will gladden him by its beauty. I turn now to the passage in question. <span class="stiki" id="note302104"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:1-7</a></span> <q>If a man desire the office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, he desires a good work.</q> Work, you see, not rank; toil not pleasure; work that he may increase in lowliness, not grow <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> by reason of elevation. <q>A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then must be blameless.</q> The same thing that he says to Titus, <q>if any be blameless.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302105"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse6">Titus&nbsp;1:6</a></span> All the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are comprehended in this one word; thus he seems to require an impossible perfection. For if every <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, even every idle word, is deserving of blame, who is there in this world that is sinless and blameless? Still he who is chosen to be shepherd of the church must be one compared with whom other men are rightly regarded as but a flock of sheep. Rhetoricians define an orator as a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man able to speak. To be worthy of so high an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> he must be blameless in life and lip. For a teacher loses all his influence whose words are rendered null by his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. <q>The husband of one wife.</q> Concerning this requirement I have spoken above. I will now only warn you that if monogamy is insisted on before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the other conditions laid down must be insisted on before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> too. For it is impossible to regard the remaining <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> as binding only on the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and this alone as binding also on the unbaptized. Vigilant (or <q>temperate</q> for <span class="greek">&#x03BD;&#x03B7;&#x03C6;&#x03B1;&#x03BB;&#x03B9;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;</span> means both), wise,  of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who minister in God's temple are forbidden to drink wine and strong drink, <span class="stiki" id="note302107"><a href="../bible/lev010.htm#verse9">Leviticus&nbsp;10:9</a></span> to keep their wits from being stupefied with <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a> and to enable their understanding to do its duty in God's service. By the word 'wise' those are excluded who plead simplicity as an excuse for a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest's</a> folly. For if the brain be not sound, all the members will be amiss. The phrase <q>of good behaviour</q> is an extension of the previous epithet <q>blameless.</q> One who has no faults is called <q>blameless;</q> one who is rich in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> is said to be <q>of good behaviour.</q> Or the words may be differently explained in accord with Tully's maxim,  'the main thing is that what you do you should do gracefully.' For some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are so <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of their own measure <span class="stiki" id="note302109"><a href="../bible/2co010.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:14</a></span> and so stupid and foolish that they make themselves laughing stocks to those who see them because of their gesture or gait or dress or conversation. Fancying that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what is and what is not good taste they deck themselves out with finery and bodily adornments and give banquets which profess to be elegant: but all such attempts at dress and display are nastier than a beggar's rags. As regards the obligation of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> to be teachers we bare have the precepts of the old Law <span class="stiki" id="note302110"><a href="../bible/deu017.htm#verse9">Deuteronomy&nbsp;17:9-11</a></span> and the fuller instructions given on the subject to Titus. <span class="stiki" id="note302111"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse9">Titus&nbsp;1:9-14</a></span> For an innocent and unobtrusive conversation does as much harm by its silence as it does good by its example. If the ravening wolves are to be frightened away it must be by the barking of dogs and by the staff of the shepherd. <q>Not given to wine, no striker.</q> With the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> they are to aim at he contrasts the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> they are to avoid.</p>

<p>9. We have learned what we ought to be: let us now learn what <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> ought not to be. Indulgence in wine is the fault of diners out and revellers. When the body is heated with drink it soon boils over with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Wine drinking means self-indulgence, self-indulgence means sensual gratification, sensual gratification means a breach of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. He that lives in pleasure is dead while he lives, <span class="stiki" id="note302112"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:6</a></span> and he that drinks himself drunk is not only dead but buried. One hour's debauch makes <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> uncover his nakedness which through sixty years of sobriety he had kept covered. <span class="stiki" id="note302113"><a href="../bible/gen009.htm#verse20">Genesis&nbsp;9:20-21</a></span> <a href="../cathen/09366a.htm">Lot</a> in a fit of intoxication unwittingly adds incest to incontinence, and wine overcomes the man whom <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> failed to conquer. <span class="stiki" id="note302114"><a href="../bible/gen019.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;19:30-38</a></span> A <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> that is a striker is condemned by Him who gave His back to the smiters, <span class="stiki" id="note302115"><a href="../bible/isa050.htm#verse6">Isaiah&nbsp;50:6</a></span> and when He was reviled reviled not again. <span class="stiki" id="note302116"><a href="../bible/1pe002.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;2:23</a></span> <q>But moderate</q>;  one good thing is set over against two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things. Drunkenness and passion are to be held in check by moderation. <q>Not a brawler, not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>.</q> Nothing is more overweening than the assurance of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> who fancy that incessant chatter will carry conviction with it and are always ready for a dispute that they may thunder with turgid eloquence against the flock committed to their charge. That a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> must avoid <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> even Samuel teaches when he proves before all the people that he has taken nothing from any man.  And the same lesson is taught by the poverty of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> who used to receive sustenance and refreshment from their brethren and to boast that they neither had nor wished to have anything besides food and raiment. <span class="stiki" id="note302119"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:8</a></span> What the epistle to Timothy calls <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, that to Titus openly censures as the desire for filthy lucre. <span class="stiki" id="note302120"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse7">Titus&nbsp;1:7</a></span> <q>One that rules well his own house.</q> Not by increasing riches, not by providing regal banquets, not by having a pile of finely-wrought plates, not by slowly steaming pheasants so that the heat may reach the bones without melting the flesh upon them; no, but by first requiring of his own household the conduct which he has to inculcate in others. <q>Having his children in subjection with all gravity.</q> They must not, that is, follow the example of the sons of Eli who lay with the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the vestibule of the Temple and, supposing religion to consist in plunder, diverted to the gratification of their own appetites all the best parts of the victims.  <q>Not a novice lest being lifted up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> he fall into the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</q> I cannot sufficiently express my amazement at the great blindness which makes men discuss such questions as that of marriage before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and causes them to charge people with a transaction which is dead in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, nay even quickened into a new life with Christ, while no one regards a commandment so clear and unmistakable as this about <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> not being novices. One who was yesterday a catechumen is today a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ; one who was yesterday in the amphitheatre is today in the church; one who spent the evening in the circus stands in the morning at the altar: one who a little while ago was a patron of actors is now a dedicator of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Was the apostle <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of our shifts and subterfuges? Did he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of our foolish arguments? He not only says that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> must be the husband of one wife, but he has given commandment that he must be blameless, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach, moderate,  not given to wine, no striker, not a brawler, not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, not a novice. Yet to all these requirements we shut our eyes and notice nothing but the wives of the aspirants. Who cannot give instances to show the need of the warning: <q>lest being lifted up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> he fall into the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>?</q> A <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  who is made such in a moment <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of the lowliness and meekness which mark the meanest of the faithful, he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> courtesy, he is not wise enough to think little of himself. He passes from one dignity to another, yet he has not fasted, he has not wept, he has not taken himself to task for his life, he has not striven by constant meditation to amend it, he has not given his substance to the poor. Yet he is moved from one see  to another, he passes, that is, from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> to <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. There can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that arrogance is what the Apostle means when he speaks of the condemnation and downfall of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> fall into this who are in a moment made masters, actually before they are <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. <q>Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without.</q> The last requirement is like the first. One who is really <q>blameless</q> obtains the unanimous approval not only of his own household but of outsiders as well. By aliens and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> outside the church we are to understand <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. A <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> then must be such that they who cavil at his religion may not venture to cavil at his life. At present however we see but too many <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are willing, like the charioteers in the horse races, to bid money for the popular applause; while there are some so universally <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> that they can wring no money from their people, a feat which clowns accomplish by means of a few gestures.</p>

<p>10. Such are the conditions, son Oceanus, which the master-teachers of the church ought with anxiety and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to require of others and to observe themselves. Such too are the canons which they should follow in the choice of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; for they must not interpret the law of Christ to suit private animosities and feuds or to gratify ill-feeling which is sure to recoil on the man who cherishes it. Consider how unimpeachable is the character of Carterius in whose life his ill-wishers can find nothing to censure except a marriage contracted before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. <q>He that said, Do not commit <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, said also, Do not kill. If we commit no <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> yet if we kill, we have become transgressors of the law.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302126"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse11">James&nbsp;2:11</a></span> <q>Whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302127"><a href="../bible/jam002.htm#verse10">James&nbsp;2:10</a></span> Accordingly when they cast in our teeth a marriage entered into before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, we must require of them compliance with all the precepts which are given to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For they pass over much that is not allowable while they censure much that is allowed.</p>
