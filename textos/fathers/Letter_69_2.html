<h1>Letter 69</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Athanasius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria</em>.</p>

<p>1. As time moves on, it continually confirms the opinion which I have long held of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; or rather that opinion is strengthened by the daily course of events. Most men are indeed satisfied with observing, each one, what lies especially within his own province; not thus is it with you, but your anxiety for all the Churches is no less than that which you feel for the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that has been especially entrusted to you by our common Lord; inasmuch as you leave no interval in speaking, exhorting, writing, and dispatching emissaries, who from time to time give the best advice in each emergency as it arises. Now, from the sacred ranks of your <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, you have sent forth the venerable brother Peter, whom I have welcomed with great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. I have also approved of the good object of his journey, which he manifests in accordance with the commands of your excellency, in effecting reconciliation where he finds opposition, and bringing about union instead of division. With the object of offering some contribution to the action which is being taken in this matter, I have thought that I could not make a more fitting beginning than by having recourse to your excellency, as to the head and chief of all, and treating you as alike adviser and commander in the enterprise. I have therefore determined to send to your reverence our brother Dorotheus the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> under the right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Meletius, being one who at once is an energetic supporter of the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and is earnestly desirous of seeing the peace of the Churches. The results, I hope, will be, that, following your suggestions (which you are able to make with the less likelihood of failure, both from your age and your experience in affairs, and because you have a greater measure than all others of the aid of the Spirit), he may thus attempt the achievement of our objects. You will welcome him, I am sure, and will look upon him with friendly eyes. You will strengthen him by the help of your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>; you will give him a letter as provision by the way; you will grant him, as companions, some of the good men and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that you have about you; so you will speed him on the road to what is before him. It has seemed to me to be desirable to send a letter to the <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, begging him to examine our condition, and since there are difficulties in the way of representatives being sent from the West by a general synodical decree, to advise him to exercise his own personal authority in the matter by choosing suitable <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to sustain the labours of a journey&mdash;suitable, too, by gentleness and firmness of character, to correct the unruly among us here; able to speak with proper reserve and appropriateness, and thoroughly well acquainted with all that has been effected after Ariminum to undo the violent measures adopted there. I should advise that, without any one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> anything about it, they should travel hither, attracting as little attention as possible, by the sea, with the object of escaping the notice of the enemies of peace.</p>

<p>2. A point also that is insisted upon by some of those in these parts, very necessarily, as is plain even to myself, is that they  should drive away the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Marcellus,  as grievous and injurious and opposed to the sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For up to this time, in all the letters which they write, they are constant in thoroughly <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a> the ill-famed <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and in repudiating him from the Churches. But they attach no blame to Marcellus, who propounded a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> diametrically opposite to that of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, and impiously attacked the very <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the Only begotten Godhead, and erroneously understood the term <q>Word.</q>  He grants indeed that the Only begotten was called <q>Word,</q> on coming forth at need and in season, but states that He returned  again to Him whence He had come forth, and had no <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> before His coming forth, nor hypostasis  after His return. The books in my possession which contain his unrighteous writings exist as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of what I say. Nevertheless they nowhere openly condemned him, and are to this extent culpable that, being from the first in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they received him into the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The present state of affairs makes it specially necessary that attention should be called to him, so that those who seek for their opportunity, may be prevented from getting it, from the fact of sound men being united to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and all who are lame in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may be openly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; that so we may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> who are on our side, and may not struggle, as in a night battle, without being able to distinguish between friends and foes. Only I do beseech you that the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, whom I have mentioned, be dispatched by the earliest possible packet, that at least some of the ends which we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for may be accomplished during the ensuing year. One thing, however, even before I mention it, you quite understand and I am sure will give heed to, that, when they come, if God will, they must not let loose schisms among the Churches; and, even though they find some who have personal reasons for mutual differences, they must leave no means untried to unite all who are of the same way of thinking. For we are bound to regard the interests of peace as paramount, and that first of all attention be paid to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, lest the sound portion of it grow diseased through division on personal grounds. But you will yourself give more complete attention to all these matters, so soon as, by the blessing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you find every one entrusting to you the responsibility of securing the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>
