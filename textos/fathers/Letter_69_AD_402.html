<h1>Letter 69 (A.D. 402)</h1>

<p> <em>To Their Justly Beloved Lord Castorius, Their Truly Welcomed and Worthily Honoured Son, Alypius and Augustine Send Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. An attempt was made by the enemy of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, by occasion of our very dear and sweet son your brother, the agitation of a most dangerous scandal within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which as a mother welcomed you to her affectionate embrace when you fled from a disinherited and separated fragment into the heritage of Christ; the desire of that enemy being evidently to becloud with unseemly melancholy the calm beauty of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which was imparted to us by the blessing of your conversion. But the Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is compassionate and merciful, who comforts them that are cast down, nourishing the infants, and cherishing the infirm, permitted him to gain in some measure success in this design, only to make us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> more over the prevention of the calamity than we grieved over the danger. For it is a far more magnanimous thing to have resigned the onerous responsibilities of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> dignity in order to save the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from danger, than to have accepted these in order to have a share in her government. He <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> proves that he was worthy of holding that office, had the interests of peace permitted him to do so, who does not insist upon retaining it when he cannot do so without endangering the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It has accordingly pleased God to show, by means of your brother, our beloved son Maximianus, unto the enemies of His Church, that there are within her those who seek not their own things, but the things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. For in laying down that ministry of stewardship of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he was not deserting his duty under the pressure of some worldly desire, but acting under the impulse of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of peace, lest, on account of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> conferred upon him, there should arise among the members of Christ an unseemly and dangerous, perhaps even fatal, dissension. For could anything have been more infatuated and worthy of utter reprobation, than to forsake schismatics because of the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and then to trouble that same <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peace by the question of one's own rank and preferment? On the other hand, could anything be more praiseworthy, and more in accordance with <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity, than that, after having forsaken the frenzied <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, he should, in the manner of his cleaving to the heritage of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, give such a signal <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of humility under the power of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? As for him, therefore, we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> indeed that he has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> of such stability that the storm of this <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> has not cast down what divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had built in his heart; and therefore we desire and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the Lord to grant that, by his life and conversation in the future, he may make it more and more manifest how well he would have discharged the responsibilities of that office which he would have accepted if that had been his duty. May that <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> peace which is promised to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be given in recompense to him, who discerned that the things which were not compatible with the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were not expedient for him!</p>

<p>2. As for you, our dear son, in whom we have great <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, since you are not restrained from accepting  the office of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> by any such considerations as have guided your brother in declining it, it becomes one of your disposition to devote to Christ that which is in you by His own gift. Your talents, <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, eloquence, gravity, self-control, and everything else which adorns your conversation, are the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. To what service can they be more fittingly devoted than to His by whom they were bestowed, in order that they may be preserved, increased, perfected, and rewarded by Him? Let them not be devoted to the service of this world, lest with it they pass away and perish. We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, in dealing with you, it is not necessary to insist much on your reflecting, as you may so easily do, upon the hopes of vain men, their insatiable desires, and the uncertainty of life. Away, therefore, with every expectation of deceptive and earthly felicity which your mind had grasped: labour in the vineyard of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where the fruit is sure, where so many promises have already received so large measure of fulfilment, that it would be the height of <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to despair as to those which remain. We beseech you by the divinity and humanity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and by the peace of that heavenly city where we receive <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> rest after labouring for the time of our pilgrimage, to take the place as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Vagina which your brother has resigned, not under ignominious deposition, but by magnanimous concession. Let that people for whom we expect the richest increase of blessings through your mind and tongue, endowed and adorned by the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash;let that people, we say, perceive through you, that in what your brother has done, he was consulting not his own indolence, but their peace.</p>

<p>We have given orders that this letter be not read to you until those to whom you are necessary hold you in actual possession.  For we hold you in the bond of spiritual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, because to us also you are very necessary as a colleague. Our reason for not coming in person to you, you shall afterwards learn.</p>
