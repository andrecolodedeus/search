<h1>Letter 6</h1>

<p> <em>For 334. Easter-day, xii Pharmuthi, vii Id. April; xvii Moon; &AElig;ra Dioclet. 50; Coss. Optatus Patricius, Anicius Paulinus; Pr&aelig;fect, Philagrius</em> , <em>the Cappadocian; vii Indict.</em></p>

<p>Now again, my beloved, has God brought us to the season of the feast, and through His loving-kindness we have reached the period of assembly for it. For that God who brought <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> out of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, even He at this time calls us to the feast, saying by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, 'Observe the month of new fruits , and keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> to the Lord your God <span class="stiki" id="note284074"><a href="../bible/deu016.htm#verse1">Deuteronomy&nbsp;16:1</a></span>:' and by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, 'Keep your feasts, O Judah; pay to the Lord your vows <span class="stiki" id="note284075"><a href="../bible/nah001.htm#verse15">Nahum&nbsp;1:15</a></span>.' If then God Himself loves the feast, and calls us to it, it is not right, my brethren, that it should be delayed, or observed carelessly; but with alacrity and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> we should come to it, so that having begun joyfully here, we may also receive an earnest of that heavenly feast. For if we diligently celebrate the feast here, we shall doubtless receive the perfect <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is in heaven, as the Lord says; 'With desire I have desired to eat this <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> with you before I suffer. For I say unto you, that I will not eat it, until it is fulfilled with you in the kingdom of God <span class="stiki" id="note284076"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse15">Luke&nbsp;22:15-16</a></span>.' Now we eat it if, understanding the reason of the feast, and acknowledging the Deliverer, we conduct ourselves in accordance with His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says; 'So that we may keep the Feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284077"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:8</a></span>.' For the Lord died in those days, that we should no longer do the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of death. He gave His life, that we might preserve our own from the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. And, what is most wonderful, the Word became flesh, that we should no longer live in the flesh, but in spirit should worship <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who is Spirit. He who is not so disposed, abuses the days, and does not keep the feast, but like an unthankful person finds fault with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and honours the days overmuch, while he does not supplicate the Lord who in those days redeemed him. Let him by all means hear, though fancying that he keeps the feast, the Apostolic voice reproving him; 'You observe days, and months, and times, and years: I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest I have laboured among you in vain <span class="stiki" id="note284078"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;4:10-11</a></span>.'</p>

<p>2. For the feast is not on account of the days; but for the Lord's sake, who then suffered for us, we celebrate it, for 'our <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> Christ, is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284079"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span>.' Even as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, when teaching <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> not to consider the feast as pertaining to the days, but to the Lord, said, 'It is the Lord's <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284080"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse11">Exodus&nbsp;12:11</a></span>.' To the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, when they thought they were keeping the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, because they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the Lord, the feast was useless; since it no longer bore the name of the Lord, even according to their own testimony. It was not the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> of the Lord, but that of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>.  The <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> was named after the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, my brethren, because they denied the Lord of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>. On this account, the Lord, turning away His face from such a doctrine of theirs, says, 'Your new moons and your sabbaths My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284082"><a href="../bible/isa001.htm#verse14">Isaiah&nbsp;1:14</a></span>.'</p>

<p>3. So now, those who keep the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> in like manner, the Lord again reproves, as He did those <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> who were cleansed, when He loved the one as thankful, but was <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with the others as ungrateful, because they did not acknowledge their Deliverer, but thought more of the cure of the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> than of Him who healed them. 'But one of them when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and fell on his face at the feet of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> giving Him thanks; and he was a <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>. And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? But those nine&mdash; whence are there none found who returned to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but this stranger ?' And there was more given to him than to the rest; for being cleansed from his <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a>, he heard from the Lord, 'Arise, go your way, your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has saved you. ' For he who gives thanks, and he who glorifies, have kindred feelings, in that they bless their Helper for the benefits they have received. So the Apostle exhorts all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to this, saying, 'Glorify God with your body;' and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> commands, saying, 'Give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' Although testimony was borne by <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>  against our Redeemer, and He was set at nought by the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and was condemned by <a href="../cathen/12083c.htm">Pilate</a> in those days, yet exalted exceedingly and most mighty was the voice of the Father which came to Him; 'I have <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and will glorify again <span class="stiki" id="note284086"><a href="../bible/joh012.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;12:28</a></span>.' For those things which He suffered for our sake have passed away; but those which belong to Him as the Saviour remain for ever.</p>

<p>4. But in our commemoration of these things, my brethren, let us not be occupied with meats, but let us glorify the Lord, let us become fools for Him who died for us, even as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> said; 'For if we are foolish, it is to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; or if we are sober-minded, it is to you; since because one died for all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, therefore all were dead to Him; and He died for all, that we who live should not henceforth live to ourselves, but to Him who died for us, and rose again. ' No longer then ought we to live to ourselves, but, as servants to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>. And not in vain should we receive the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, as the time is especially an acceptable one , and the day of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has dawned, even the death of our Redeemer.  For even for our sakes the Word came down, and being incorruptible, put on a corruptible body for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of all of us. Of which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> was confident, saying, 'This corruptible must put on incorruption <span class="stiki" id="note284090"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span>.' The Lord too was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, that by His blood He might abolish death. Full well did He once, in a certain place, blame those who participated vainly in the shedding of His blood, while they did not delight themselves in the flesh of the Word, saying, 'What profit is there in my blood, that I go down to corruption ?' This does not mean that the descent of the Lord was without profit, for it gained the whole world; but rather that after He had thus suffered, sinners would prefer to suffer loss than to profit by it. For He regarded our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> as a delight and a peculiar gain; while on the contrary He looked upon our destruction as loss.</p>

<p>5. Also in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, He praises those who increased the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> twofold, both him who made ten talents of five, and him who made four talents of two, as those who had profited, and turned them to good account; but him who hid the talent He cast out as wanting, saying to him, 'You <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> servant! ought you not to have put My money to the exchangers? Then at My coming I should have received My own with interest. Take, therefore, from him the talent, and give it to him that has ten talents. For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have more abundantly; but from him that has not, shall be taken away even that which he has. And cast the unprofitable servant into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ' For it is not His <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> we have received should be unprofitable; but He requires us to take pains to render Him His own fruits, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> says; 'The fruit of the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and peace <span class="stiki" id="note284093"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;5:22</a></span>.' Having therefore this right resolution, and owing no man anything, but rather giving everything to every man, he was a teacher of the like rightness of principle, saying, 'Render to all their dues <span class="stiki" id="note284094"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;13:7</a></span>.' He was like those sent by the householder to receive the fruits of the vineyard from the husbandmen <span class="stiki" id="note284095"><a href="../bible/mat021.htm#verse33">Matthew&nbsp;21:33</a></span>; for he exhorted all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to render a return. But <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> despised and would not render, for their will was not right, nay moreover they killed those that were sent, and not even before the Lord of the vineyard were they ashamed, but even He was slain by them. Verily, when He came and found no fruit in them, He cursed them through the fig-tree, saying, 'Let there be henceforth no fruit from you ;' and the fig-tree was dead and fruitless so that even the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> wondered when it withered away.</p>

<p>6. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>; 'I will take away from them the voice of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and the voice of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the scent of myrrh, and the light of a lamp, and the whole land shall be destroyed <span class="stiki" id="note284097"><a href="../bible/jer025.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;25:10</a></span>.' For the whole service of the law has been abolished from them, and henceforth and for ever they remain without a feast. And they observe not the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>; for how can they? They have no abiding place, but they wander everywhere. And they eat unleavened bread contrary to the law, since they are unable first to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> the lamb, as they were commanded to do when eating unleavened bread. But in every place they transgress the law, and as the judgments of God require, they keep days of grief instead of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. Now the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this to them was the slaying of the Lord, and that they did not reverence the Only-Begotten. At this time the altogether <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> schismatics are in the same case; the one in that they slay the Word, the other in that they rend the coat. They too remain expelled from the feast, because they live without godliness and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and emulate the conduct shown in the matter of Bar-Abbas the robber, whom the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> desired instead of the Saviour. Therefore the Lord cursed them under the figure of the fig-tree. Yet even thus He spared them in His loving-kindness, not destroying them root and all. For He did not curse the root, but [said], that no man should eat fruit of it thenceforth. When He did this, He abolished the shadow, causing it to wither; but preserved the root, so that we might [not]  be grafted upon it; 'they too, if they abide not in unbelief, may attain to be grafted into their own olive tree <span class="stiki" id="note284099"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;11:23</a></span>.' Now when the Lord had cursed them because of their negligence, He removed from them the new moons, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> lamb, and that which is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>.</p>

<p>7. But to us it came: there came too the solemn day, in which we ought to call to the feast with a trumpet , and separate ourselves to the Lord with thanksgiving, considering it as our own festival.  For we are bound to celebrate it, not to ourselves but to the Lord; and to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, not in ourselves but in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, who bore our griefs and said, 'My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is sorrowful unto death <span class="stiki" id="note284102"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse38">Matthew&nbsp;26:38</a></span>.' For the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and all those who are strangers to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, keep feasts according to their own wills, and have no peace, since they commit <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against God. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as they live to the Lord also keep the feast to Him, saying, 'I will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in Your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,' and, 'my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> shall be joyful in the Lord.' The commandment is common to them, 'Rejoice, you righteous, in the Lord '&mdash; so that they also may be gathered together, to sing that common and festal Psalm, 'Come, let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> ,' not in ourselves, but, 'in the Lord.'</p>

<p>8. For thus the patriarch <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> rejoiced not to see his own day, but that of the Lord; and thus looking forward 'he saw it, and was glad <span class="stiki" id="note284105"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse56">John&nbsp;8:56</a>; <a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse17">Hebrews&nbsp;11:17</a></span>.' And when he was tried, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he offered up Isaac, and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> his only-begotten son&mdash; he who had received the promises. And, in offering his son, he worshipped the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>. And, being restrained from <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> Isaac, he saw the Messiah in the ram , which was offered up instead as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The patriarch was tried, through Isaac, not however that he was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>, but He who was pointed out in Isaiah; 'He shall be led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers he shall be speechless <span class="stiki" id="note284107"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse7">Isaiah&nbsp;53:7</a></span>;' but He took away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world. And on this account [<a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>] was restrained from laying his hand on the lad, lest the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, taking occasion from the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Isaac, should reject the prophetic declarations concerning our Saviour, even all of them, but more especially those uttered by the Psalmist; 'Sacrifice and offering You would not; a body You have prepared Me ;' and should refer all such things as these to the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>.</p>

<p>9. For the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> was not properly the setting to rights  of Isaac, but of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> who also offered, and by that was tried. Thus God accepted the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the offerer, but prevented that which was offered from being <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a>. For the death of Isaac did not procure freedom to the world, but that of our Saviour alone, by whose stripes we all are healed. <span class="stiki" id="note284110"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;53:5</a></span> For He raised up the falling, healed the sick, satisfied those who were hungry, and filled the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and, what is more wonderful, raised us all from the dead; having abolished death, He has brought us from affliction and sighing to the rest and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of this feast, a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which reaches even to heaven. For not we alone are affected by this, but because of it, even the heavens <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with us, and the whole church of the <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">firstborn</a>, written in heaven <span class="stiki" id="note284111"><a href="../bible/heb012.htm#verse23">Hebrews&nbsp;12:23</a></span>, is made glad together, as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> proclaims, saying, 'Rejoice, you heavens, for the Lord has had mercy upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Shout, you foundations of the earth. Cry out with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, you mountains, you high places, and all the trees which are in them, for the Lord has redeemed Jacob, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> has been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284112"><a href="../bible/isa044.htm#verse23">Isaiah&nbsp;44:23</a></span>.' And again; 'Rejoice, and be glad, you heavens; let the hills melt into <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>, for the Lord has had mercy on His people, and comforted the oppressed of the people <span class="stiki" id="note284113"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;49:13</a></span>.'</p>

<p>10. The whole creation keeps a feast, my brethren, and everything that has breath praises the Lord , as the Psalmist [says], on account of the destruction of the enemies, and our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. And <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> indeed; for if there is <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in heaven over one sinner that <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">repents</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284115"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;15:7</a></span>, what should there not be over the abolition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the resurrection of the dead? Oh what a feast and how great the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in heaven! How must all its hosts <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and exult, as they <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and watch in our assemblies, those that are held continually, and especially those at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>? For they look on sinners while they repent; on those who have turned away their faces, when they become converted; on those who formerly persisted in <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> and excess, but who now <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> themselves by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>; and, finally, on the enemy who lies weakened, lifeless, bound hand and foot, so that we may mock at him; 'Where is your victory, O Death? Where is your sting, O Grave ?' Let us then sing unto the Lord a song of victory.</p>

<p>11. Who then will lead us to such a company of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> as this? Who, coming with a desire for the heavenly feast, and the angelic holiday, will say like the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, 'I will pass to the place of the wondrous tabernacle, unto the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; with the voice of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and praise, with the shouting of those who keep festival ?' To this course the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> also encourage us, saying, 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob <span class="stiki" id="note284118"><a href="../bible/isa002.htm#verse3">Isaiah&nbsp;2:3</a></span>.' But not for the impure is this feast, nor is the ascent thereto for sinners; but it is for the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> and diligent; and for those who live according to the aim of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; for, 'Who shall ascend to the hill of the Lord? Or who shall stand in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place, but he that has clean hands, and a pure heart; who has not devoted his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to vanity, nor <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a> deceitfully to his neighbour. For he,' as the Psalmist adds, when he goes up, 'shall receive a blessing from the Lord. ' Now this clearly also refers to what the Lord gives to them at the right hand, saying, 'Come, you blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you <span class="stiki" id="note284120"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse34">Matthew&nbsp;25:34</a></span>.' But the deceitful, and he that is not pure of heart, and possesses nothing that is pure (as the Proverb says, 'To a deceitful man there is nothing good '), shall assuredly, being a stranger, and of a different race from the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, be accounted unworthy to eat the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, for 'a foreigner shall not eat of it <span class="stiki" id="note284122"><a href="../bible/exo012.htm#verse43">Exodus&nbsp;12:43</a></span>.' Thus Judas, when he thought he kept the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, because he plotted deceit against the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a>, was estranged from the city which is above, and from the apostolic company. For the law commanded the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> to be eaten with due observance; but he, while eating it, was sifted of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284123"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;22:31</a></span>, who had entered his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>12. Wherefore let us not celebrate the feast after an earthly manner, but as keeping festival in heaven with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. Let us glorify the Lord, by <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, by righteousness, and other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. And let us <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, not in ourselves, but in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, that we may be inheritors with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Let us keep the feast then, as <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Let us watch like David who rose seven times, and in the middle of the night gave thanks for the righteous judgments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let us be early, as he said, 'In the morning I will stand before You, and You will look upon me: in the morning You will hear my voice. ' Let us fast like Daniel; let us <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> without ceasing, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> commanded; all of us recognising the season of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, but especially those who are honourably married; so that having borne <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to these things, and thus having kept the feast, we may be able to enter into the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of Christ in the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>.  But as <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, when going up to Jerusalem, was first purified in the wilderness, being trained to forget the customs of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, the Word by this typifying to us the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fast of forty days, let us first be purified and freed from defilement , so that when we depart hence, having been careful of <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>, we may be able to ascend to the upper chamber  with the Lord, to sup with Him; and may be partakers of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is in heaven. In no other manner is it possible to go up to Jerusalem, and to eat the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, except by observing the fast of forty days.</p>

<p>13. We begin the fast of forty days on the first day of the month Phamenoth (Feb. 25); and having prolonged it till the fifth of Pharmuthi (March 31), suspending it upon the Sundays and the Saturdays  preceding them, we then begin again on the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> days of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>, on the sixth of Pharmuthi (Apr, 1), and cease on the eleventh of the same month (Apr. 6), late in the evening  of the Saturday, whence dawns on us the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Sunday, on the twelfth of Pharmuthi (Apr. 7), which extends its beams, with unobscured <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to all the seven weeks of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Pentecost. Resting on that day, let us ever keep <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, through Whom, to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. All the brethren who are with me salute you. Salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>.</p>
