<h1>Letter 6</h1>

<p><strong>To Julian, a Deacon of Antioch</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This letter, written in 374 A.D., is chiefly interesting for its mention of Jerome's sister. It would seem that she had fallen into <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and had been restored to a life of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, Julian. Jerome speaks of her again in the next letter (&sect;4).</span> </p>

<p>It is an old saying, <q>Liars are disbelieved even when they speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q>  And from the way in which you reproach me for not having written, I perceive that this has been my lot with you. Shall I say, <q>I wrote often, but the bearers of my letters were negligent</q>? You will reply, <q>Your excuse is the old one of all who fail to write.</q> Shall I say, <q>I could not find any one to take my letters</q>? You will say that numbers of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have gone from my part of the world to yours. Shall I contend that I have actually given them letters? They not having delivered them, will deny that they have received them. Moreover, so great a distance separates us that it will be hard to come at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. What shall I do then? Though really not to blame, I ask your forgiveness, for I think it better to fall back and make overtures for peace than to keep my ground and offer battle. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is that constant sickness of body and vexation of mind have so weakened me that with death so close at hand I have not been as collected as usual. And lest you should account this plea a false one, now that I have stated my case, I shall, like a pleader, call witnesses to prove it. Our reverend brother, Heliodorus, has been here; but in spite of his wish to dwell in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> with me, he has been frightened away by my crimes. But my present wordiness will atone for my past remissness; for, as Horace says in his satire: </p>

<blockquote><p>All singers have one fault among their friends:
<br>They never sing when asked, unasked they never cease.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Henceforth I shall overwhelm you with such bundles of letters that you will take the opposite line and beg me not to write.</p>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that my sister &mdash; to you a daughter in Christ&mdash; remains steadfast in her purpose, a piece of news which I owe in the first instance to you. For here where I now am I am <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> not only as to what goes on in my native land, but even as to its continued <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Even though the Iberian viper  shall rend me with his baneful fangs, I will not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> men's judgment, seeing that I shall have God to judge me. As one puts it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Shatter the world to fragments if you will:
<br>'Twill fall upon a head which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>Bear in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, the apostle's precept <span class="stiki" id="note300090"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:14</a></span> that we should make our work abiding; prepare for yourself a reward from the Lord in my sister's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and by frequent letters increase my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> in that <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in Christ which we share together.</p>
