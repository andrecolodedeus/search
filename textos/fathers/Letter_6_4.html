<h1>Letter 6</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To the wife of Nectarius</em>.</p>

<p>1. I hesitated to address your excellency, from the idea that, just as to the eye when inflamed even the mildest of remedies causes pain, so to a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> distressed by heavy sorrow, words offered in the moment of agony, even though they do bring much comfort, seem to be somewhat out of place. But I bethought me that I should be speaking to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, who has long ago learned godly lessons, and is not inexperienced in the vicissitudes of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, and I judged it right not to neglect the duty laid upon me. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what a mother's heart is,  and when I remember how good and gentle you are to all, I can reckon the probable extent of your misery at this present time. You have lost a son whom, while he was alive, all mothers called <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>, with <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that their own might be like him, and on his death bewailed, as though each had hidden her own in the grave. His death is a blow to two provinces, both to mine and to Cilicia. With him has fallen a great and illustrious race, dashed to the ground as by the withdrawal of a prop. Alas for the mighty mischief that the contact with an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a> was able to wreak! Earth, what a calamity you have been compelled to sustain! If the sun had any feeling one would think he might have shuddered at so sad a sight. Who could utter all that the spirit in its helplessness would have said?</p>

<p>2. But our lives are not without a Providence. So we have learned in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, for not a sparrow falls to the ground without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of our Father. <span class="stiki" id="note321775"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;10:29</a></span> Whatever has come to pass has come to pass by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of our Creator. And who can resist <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>? Let us accept what has befallen us; for if we take it ill we do not mend the past and we work our own ruin. Do not let us arraign the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. We are all too untaught to assail His ineffable sentences. The Lord is now making trial of your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Him. Now there is an opportunity for you, through your patience, to take the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> lot. The mother of the Maccabees  saw the death of seven sons without a sigh, without even shedding one unworthy tear. She gave thanks to God for seeing them freed from the fetters of the flesh by fire and steel and cruel blows, and she won praise from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and fame among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>. The loss is great, as I can say myself; but great too are the rewards laid up by the Lord for the patient. When first you were made a mother, and saw your boy, and thanked <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> all the while that, a mortal yourself, you had given birth to a mortal. What is there astonishing in the death of a mortal? But we are grieved at his dying before his time. Are we sure that this was not his time? We do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to pick and choose what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> for our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, or how to fix the limits of the life of man. Look round at all the world in which you live; remember that everything you see is mortal, and all subject to corruption. Look up to heaven; even it shall be dissolved; look at the sun, not even the sun will last for ever. All the stars together, all living things of land and sea, all that is fair on earth, aye, earth itself, all are subject to decay; yet a little while and all shall be no more. Let these considerations be some comfort to you in your trouble. Do not measure your loss by itself; if you do it will seem intolerable; but if you take all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs into account you will find that some comfort is to be derived from them. Above all, one thing I would strongly urge; spare your husband. Be a comfort to others. Do not make his trouble harder to bear by wearing yourself away with sorrow. Mere words I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> cannot give comfort. Just now what is wanted is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>; and I do <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the Lord Himself to touch your heart by His unspeakable power, and through good thoughts to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> light to shine upon your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, that you may have a source of consolation in yourself.</p>
