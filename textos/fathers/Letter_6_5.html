<h1>Letter 6</h1>

<p>Leo to his beloved brother Anastasius.</p>

<h2>I. He is pleased to have been consulted by the bishops of Illyricum on important questions.</h2>

<p>The brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of our colleagues makes us read with grateful mind the letters of all <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> ; for in them we embrace one another in the spirit as if we were face to face, and by the intercourse of such epistles we are associated in mutual converse.  But in this present letter the affection displayed seems to us greater than usual: for it informs us of the state of the churches , and urges us to a vigilant exercise of care by a consideration of our office, so that being placed, as it were, on a watchtower, according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, we should both lend our approval to things when they run in accordance with our wishes, and correct, by applying the remedies of compulsion, what we observe gone wrong through any aggression: hoping that abundant fruit will be the result of our sowing the seed, if we do not allow those things to increase which have begun to spring up to the spoiling of the harvest.</p>

<h2>II. Following the examples of his predecessors he nominates Anastasius Metropolitan of Illyricum.</h2>

<p>Now therefore, dear brother, that your request has been made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to us through our son Nicolaus the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, that you, too, like your predecessors, might receive from us in our turn authority over <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a> for the observance of the rules, we give our consent and earnestly exhort that no concealment and no negligence may be allowed in the management of the churches situated throughout <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a>, which we commit to you in our stead, following the precedent of <a href="../cathen/14026a.htm">Siricius</a> of blessed remembrance, who then, for the first time, acting on a fixed method, entrusted them to your last predecessor but one , Anysius of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, who had at the time well deserved of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, and was approved by after events: that he might render assistance to the churches situated in that province whom he wished kept up to discipline. Noble precedents must be followed with eagerness that  we may show ourselves in all things like those whose privileges we wish to enjoy. We wish you to imitate your last predecessor  but one as well as of your immediate predecessor who is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> equally with the former to have both deserved and employed this privilege: so that we may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the progress of the churches which we commit to you in our stead. For as the conduct of matters progresses creditably when committed to one who acts well and carries out skilfully the duties of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> position, so it is found to be only a burden to him who, when power is entrusted to him, uses not the moderation that is due.</p>

<h2>III. Ordinees must be carefully selected with especial reference to the Canons of the church.</h2>

<p>And so, dear brother, hold with vigilance the helm entrusted to you, and direct your mind's gaze around on all which you see put in your charge, guarding what will conduce to your reward and resisting those who strive to upset the discipline of the canons. The sanction of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s law must be respected, and the decrees of the canons should be more especially kept. Throughout the provinces committed to you let such <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the Lord as are commended only by their deserving life and position among the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>. Permit no licence to personal favour, nor to canvassing, nor to purchased votes. Let the cases of those who are to be ordained be investigated carefully and let them be trained in the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> through a considerable period of their life. But if all the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers are found in them, and if they have observed all that we read the blessed <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> to have enjoined on such, viz., that he be the husband of one wife, and that she was a <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgin</a> when he married her, as the authority of God's law requires, [then ordain them ]. And this we are extremely anxious should be observed, so as to do away with all place for excuses, lest any one should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> himself able to attain to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> who has taken a wife before he obtained the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and on her decease joined himself to another after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Seeing that the former wife cannot be ignored, nor the previous marriage put out of the reckoning, and that he is as much the father of the children whom he begot by that wife before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as he is of those whom he is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to have begotten by the second after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and things which are <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be unlawful are washed away in the font of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so what are allowed or lawful are not done away.</p>

<h2>IV. The Metropolitans must not ordain hastily nor without consulting their Primate.</h2>

<p>Let one be ordained a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  throughout these churches inconsiderately; for by this means ripe judgments will be formed about those to be elected, if your scrutiny, brother, is dreaded. But let any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> who, contrary to our command, is ordained by his metropolitan without your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has no assured position with us, and that those who have taken on themselves so to do must render an account of their presumption.  But as to each metropolitan is committed such power that he has the right of ordaining in his province, so we wish those metropolitans to be ordained, but not without ripe and well-considered judgment. For although it is seemly that all who are <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> should be approved and well-pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, yet we wish those to have peculiar excellence whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> are going to preside over the fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> who are assigned to them. And we admonish you, beloved, to see to this the more diligently and carefully, that you may be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to keep that precept of the Apostles which runs, <q>lay hands suddenly on no man <span class="stiki" id="note360048"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:22</a></span> .</q></p>

<h2>V. Points which cannot be settled at the provincial synod are to be referred to Rome.</h2>

<p>Any of the brethren who has been summoned to a synod should attend and not deny himself to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> congregation: for there especially he should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what will conduce to the good discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be settled. For all faults will be better avoided if more frequent conferences take place between the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of the Lord, and intimate association is the greatest help alike to improvement and to brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. There, if any questions arise, under the Lord's guidance they will be able to be determined, so that no bad feeling remains, and only a firmer <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> exists among the brethren. But if any more important question spring up, such as cannot be settled there under your presidency, brother, send your report and consult us, so that we may write back under the revelation of the Lord, of whose mercy it is that we can do ought, because He has breathed favourably upon us : that by our decision we may vindicate  our right of cognizance in accordance with old-established tradition and the respect that is due to the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>: for as we wish you to exercise your authority in our stead, so we reserve to ourselves points which cannot be decided on the spot and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have made appeal to us.</p>

<h2>VI. Priests and deacons may not be ordained on weekdays any more than bishops.</h2>

<p>You shall take order that this letter reach the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all the brethren, so that no one hereafter find an opportunity to excuse himself through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> in observing these things which we command. We have directed our letter of admonition  to the metropolitans themselves also of the several provinces, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they must <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the Apostolic injunctions, and that they <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> us in beginning to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> you, brother, our delegate according to what we have written. We hear, indeed, and we cannot pass it over in silence, that only <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> are ordained by certain brethren on Sundays only; but <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, whose consecration should be equally solemn , receive the dignity of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office indiscriminately on any day, which is a reprehensible practice contrary to the canons and tradition of the Fathers , since the custom ought by all means to be kept by those who have received it with respect to all the sacred orders: so that after a proper lapse of time he who is to be ordained a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>  may be advanced through all the ranks of the clerical office, and thus a man may have time to learn that of which he himself also is one day to be a teacher. Dated the 12th of January, in the consulship of Theodosius (18th time) and Albinus (444).</p>
