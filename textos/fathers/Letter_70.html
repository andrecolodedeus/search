<h1>Letter 70</h1>

<p> <em>To Eustathius, Bishop of &AElig;g&aelig;.</em> </p>

<p>The story of the noble Mary is one fit for a tragic play. As she says herself, and as is attested by several others, she is a daughter of the right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Eud&aelig;mon. In the catastrophe which has overtaken Libya she has fallen from her father's free estate, and has become a slave. Some merchants bought her from the barbarians, and have sold her to some of our countrymen. With her was sold a maiden who was once one of her own domestic servants; so at one and the same time the galling yoke of slavery fell on the servant and the mistress. But the servant refused to ignore the difference between them, nor could she forget the old superiority: in their calamity she preserved her kindly feeling, and, after waiting upon their common masters, waited upon her who was reckoned her fellow slave, washed her feet, made her bed, and was mindful of other like offices. This became <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the purchasers. Then through all the town was noised abroad the free estate of the mistress and the servant's goodness. On these circumstances becoming <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the faithful soldiers who are quartered in our city (I was absent at the time) they paid the purchasers their price, and rescued the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> from slavery. After my return, on being informed of the deplorable circumstances, and the admirable intention of the soldiers, I invoked blessings on their heads, committed the noble damsel to the care of one of the respectable <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, and ordered a sufficient provision to be made for her. Ten months had gone by when she heard that her father was still alive, and holding high office in the West, and she very naturally expressed a desire to return to him. It was reported that many messengers from the West are on the way to the fair which is now being held in your parts. She requested to be allowed to set out with a letter from me. Under these circumstances I have written this letter, begging your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> to take care of a noble girl, and charge some respectable person to communicate with mariners, pilots, and merchants, and commit her to the care of trusty men who may be able to restore her to her father. There is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that those who, when all hope of recovery has been lost, bring the daughter to the father, will be abundantly rewarded.</p>
