<h1>Letter 70</h1>

<p class="c30"> <span class="c1">Letter LXX. To Magnus an Orator of Rome.</span> </p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Jerome thanks Magnus, a Roman orator, for his services in bringing a young man named Sebesius to apologize to him for some fault that he had committed. He then replies to a criticism of Magnus on his fondness for making quotations from profane writers, a practice which he defends by the example of the fathers of the church and of the inspired penmen of scripture. He ends by hinting that the objection really comes not from Magnus himself but from Rufinus (here nicknamed Calpurnius Lanarius). The date of the letter is 397 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. That our friend Sebesius has profited by your advice I have learned less from your letter than from his own penitence. And strange to say the pleasure which he has given me since his rebuke is greater than the pain he caused me from his previous waywardness. There has been indeed a conflict between indulgence in the father, and affection in the son; while the former is anxious to forget the past, the latter is eager to promise dutiful behaviour in the future. Accordingly you and I must equally <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, you because you have successfully put a pupil to the test, I because I have received a son again.</p>

<p>2. You ask me at the close of your letter why it is that sometimes in my writings I quote examples from secular literature and thus defile the whiteness of the church with the foulness of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a>. I will now briefly answer your question. You would never have asked it, had not your mind been wholly taken up with Tully; you would never have asked it had you made it a practice instead of studying Volcatius  to read the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures and the commentators upon them. For who is there who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that both in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and in the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> there are passages cited from Gentile books and that Solomon proposed questions to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and answered others put to him by them.  In the commencement of the book of Proverbs he charges us to understand <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> maxims and shrewd adages, <a href="../cathen/11460a.htm">parables</a> and obscure discourse, the words of the wise and their dark sayings; <span class="stiki" id="note302130"><a href="../bible/pro001.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;1:1-6</a></span> all of which belong by right to the sphere of the dialectician and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also, in writing to Titus, has used a line of the poet Epimenides: <q>The Cretians are always liars, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> beasts, slow bellies.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302131"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse12">Titus&nbsp;1:12</a></span> Half of which line was afterwards adopted by Callimachus. It is not surprising that a literal rendering of the words into Latin should fail to preserve the metre, seeing that Homer when translated into the same language is scarcely intelligible even in prose. In another epistle <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> quotes a line of Menander: <q>Evil communications corrupt good manners.</q>  And when he is arguing with the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a> upon the Areopagus he calls Aratus as a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> citing from him the words <q>For we are also his offspring;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302133"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;17:28</a></span> in Greek <span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x1FE6; &#x03B3;&#x1F70;&#x03C1; &#x03BA;&#x03B1;&#x1F76; &#x03B3;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03BF;&#x03C2; &#x1F10;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x03B5;&#x03BD;</span>, the close of a heroic verse. And as if this were not enough, that leader of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> army, that unvanquished pleader for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, skilfully turns a chance inscription into a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302134"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse22">Acts&nbsp;17:22</a></span> For he had learned from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> David to wrench the sword of the enemy out of his hand and with his own blade to cut off the head of the arrogant Goliath.  He had read in Deuteronomy the command given by the voice of the Lord that when a captive <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had had her head shaved, her eyebrows and all her hair cut off, and her nails pared, she might then be taken to wife. <span class="stiki" id="note302136"><a href="../bible/deu021.htm#verse10">Deuteronomy&nbsp;21:10-13</a></span> Is it surprising that I too, admiring the fairness of her form and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of her eloquence, desire to make that secular wisdom which is my captive and my handmaid, a matron of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>? Or that shaving off and cutting away all in her that is dead whether this be <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, pleasure, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, or <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, I take her to myself clean and pure and beget by her servants for the Lord of Sabaoth? My efforts promote the advantage of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, my so-called defilement with an alien increases the number of my fellow-servants. Hosea took a wife of whoredoms, Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, and this harlot bore him a son called Jezreel or the seed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302137"><a href="../bible/hos001.htm#verse2">Hosea&nbsp;1:2-4</a></span> Isaiah speaks of a sharp razor which shaves <q>the head of sinners and the hair of their feet;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302138"><a href="../bible/isa007.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;7:20</a></span> and Ezekiel shaves his head as a type of that Jerusalem which has been an harlot, <span class="stiki" id="note302139"><a href="../bible/eze005.htm#verse1">Ezekiel&nbsp;5:1-5</a></span> in sign that whatever in her is devoid of sense and life must be removed.</p>

<p>3. Cyprian, a man renowned both for his eloquence and for his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death, was assailed&mdash; so Firmian tells us &mdash; for having used in his treatise against Demetrius passages from the Prophets and the Apostles which the latter declared to be fabricated and made up, instead of passages from the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and poets whose authority he, as a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, could not well gainsay. Celsus  and Porphyry  have written against us and have been ably answered, the former by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, the latter by Methodius, Eusebius, and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>.  <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> wrote a treatise in eight books, the work of Methodius  extended to ten thousand lines while Eusebius  and <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>  composed twenty-five and thirty volumes respectively. Read these and you will find that compared with them I am a mere tyro in learning, and that, as my wits have long lain fallow, I can barely recall as in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a> what I have learned as a boy. The emperor Julian  found time during his Parthian campaign to vomit forth seven books against Christ and, as so often happens in poetic legends, only wounded himself with his own sword. Were I to try to confute him with the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> and stoics you would doubtless forbid me to strike a mad dog with the club of Hercules. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that he presently felt in battle the hand of our Nazarene or, as he used to call him, the Galil&aelig;an,  and that a spear-thrust in the vitals paid him due recompense for his foul <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>. To prove the antiquity of the Jewish people <a href="../cathen/08522a.htm">Josephus</a>  has written two books against Appio a grammarian of Alexandria; and in these he brings forward so many quotations from secular writers as to make me marvel how a Hebrew brought up from his childhood to read the sacred scriptures could also have perused the whole <a href="../cathen/09227b.htm">library</a> of the Greeks. Need I speak of <a href="../cathen/12023a.htm">Philo</a>  whom critics call the second or the Jewish <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>?</p>

<p>4. Let me now run through the list of our own writers. Did not <a href="../cathen/12589b.htm">Quadratus</a>  a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Athenian church deliver to the <a href="../cathen/07104b.htm">Emperor Hadrian</a> (on the occasion of his visit to the Eleusinian <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>) a treatise in defence of our religion. And so great was the admiration caused in everyone by his eminent ability that it stilled a most severe <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> <a href="../cathen/01712d.htm">Aristides</a>,  a man of great eloquence, presented to the same Emperor an apology for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> composed of extracts from <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> writers. His example was afterwards followed by Justin  another <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> who delivered to <a href="../cathen/01586a.htm">Antoninus Pius</a> and his sons  and to the senate a treatise <em>Against the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a></em>, in which he defended the ignominy of the cross and preached the resurrection of Christ with all freedom. Need I speak of <a href="../cathen/10166b.htm">Melito</a>  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/13472a.htm">Sardis</a>, of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>  chief-<a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Hierapolis, of Dionysius  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Corinthians, of <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>,  of <a href="../cathen/02293a.htm">Bardesanes</a>,  of <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>  successor to the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Pothinus;  all of whom have in many volumes explained the uprisings of the several <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and tracked them back, each to the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophic</a> source from which it flows. Pant&aelig;nus,  a <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> of the Stoic school, was on account of his great <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> for learning sent by Demetrius <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria to India, to preach Christ to the Brahmans and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> there. Clement,  a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of Alexandria, in my judgment the most learned of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, wrote eight books of <em>Miscellanies</em> and as many of <em>Outline Sketches</em>,  a treatise against the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and three volumes called the <em>Pedagogue</em>. Is there any want of learning in these, or are they not rather drawn from the very heart of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? Imitating his example <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>  wrote ten books of <em>Miscellanies</em>, in which he compares together the opinions held respectively by <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and by <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, and confirms all the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of our religion by quotations from <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Aristotle, from Numenius  and Cornutus.  Miltiades  also wrote an excellent treatise against the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. Moreover Hippolytus  and a Roman senator named Apollonius  have each compiled apologetic works. The books of <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Julius Africanus</a>  who wrote a history of his own times are still extant, as also are those of Theodore who was afterwards called Gregory,  a man endowed with apostolic <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> as well as with apostolic <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. We still have the works of Dionysius  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, of Anatolius  chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of the church of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> Pamphilus,  Pierius,  Lucian,  Malchion;  of Eusebius  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea, Eustathius  of <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> and Athanasius  of Alexandria; of Eusebius  of Emisa, of Triphyllius  of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>, of Asterius  of Scythopolis, of the confessor Serapion,  of Titus  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Bostra; and of the Cappadocians Basil,  Gregory,  and Amphilochius.  All these writers so frequently interweave in their books the doctrines and maxims of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> that you might easily be at a loss which to admire most, their secular erudition or their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the scriptures.</p>

<p>5. I will pass on to Latin writers. Can anything be more learned or more pointed than the style of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>?  His <em>Apology</em> and his books <em>Against the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a></em> contain all the wisdom of the world. <a href="../cathen/10336a.htm">Minucius Felix</a>  a pleader in the Roman courts has ransacked all <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> literature to adorn the pages of his <em>Octavius</em> and of his treatise <em>Against the astrologers</em> (unless indeed this latter is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> ascribed to him). Arnobius  has published seven books against the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and his pupil Lactantius  as many, besides two volumes, one <em>on Anger</em> and the other <em>on the creative activity of God</em>. If you read any of these you will find in them an epitome of Cicero's dialogues. The Martyr Victorinus  though as a writer deficient in learning is not deficient in the wish to use what learning he has. Then there is Cyprian.  With what terseness, with what <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of all history, with what splendid rhetoric and argument has he touched the theme that <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> are no Gods! Hilary  too, a confessor and <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of my own day, has imitated Quintilian's twelve books both in number and in style, and has also shown his ability as a writer in his short treatise against Dioscorus the physician. In the reign of Constantine the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Juvencus  set forth in verse the story of our Lord and Saviour, and did not shrink from forcing into metre the majestic phrases of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. Of other writers dead and living I say nothing. Their aim and their ability are evident to all who read them. </p>

<p>6. You must not adopt the mistaken opinion, that while in dealing with the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> one may appeal to their literature in all other discussions one ought to ignore it; for almost all the books of all these writers&mdash; except those who like <a href="../cathen/05500b.htm">Epicurus</a>  are no scholars&mdash; are extremely full of erudition and <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. I incline indeed to fancy&mdash; the thought comes into my head as I dictate&mdash; that you yourself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> quite well what has always been the practice of the learned in this matter. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that in putting this question to me you are only the mouthpiece of another who by reason of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the histories of Sallust might well be called Calpurnius Lanarius.  Please beg of him not to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> eaters their teeth because he is toothless himself, and not to make light of the eyes of gazelles because he is himself a mole. Here as you see there is abundant material for discussion, but I have already filled the limits at my disposal.</p>
