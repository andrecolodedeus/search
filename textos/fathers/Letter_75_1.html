<h1>Letter 75</h1>

<p><strong>To Theodora</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Theodora the wife of the learned Spaniard Lucinius (for whom see Letter LXXI.) had recently lost her husband, a bereavement which suggested the present letter. In it Jerome recounts the many <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of Lucinius and especially his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> in resisting the gnostic <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of Marcus which during his life was prevalent in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. The date of the letter is 399 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. So overpowered am I by the sad intelligence of the falling asleep of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and by me deeply revered Lucinius that I am scarcely able to dictate even a short letter. I do not, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, lament his <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he has passed to better things: like <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> he can say: <q>I will now turn aside and see this great sight,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302269"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;3:3</a></span> but I am tormented with regret that I was not allowed to look upon the face of one, who was likely, as I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, in a short time to come hither. True indeed is the prophetic warning concerning the doom of death that it divides brothers,  and with harsh and cruel hand sunders those whose names are linked together in the bonds of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. But we have this consolation that it is slain by the word of the Lord. For it is said: <q>O death, I will be your plagues; O grave, I will be your destruction,</q> and in the next verse: <q>An east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302271"><a href="../bible/hos013.htm#verse14">Hosea&nbsp;13:14-15</a></span> For, as Isaiah says, <q>there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots</q>:  and He says Himself in the Song of Songs, <q>I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valley.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302273"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse1">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:1</a></span> Our rose is the destruction of death, and died that death itself might die in His dying. But, when it is said that He is to be brought <q>from the wilderness,</q> the virgin's womb is indicated, which without sexual intercourse or impregnation has given to us God in the form of an infant able to quench by the glow of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> the fountains of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> and to sing in the words of the psalm: <q>as in a dry and pathless and waterless land, so have I appeared unto you in the sanctuary.</q>  Thus when we have to face the hard and cruel necessity of death, we are upheld by this consolation, that we shall shortly see again those whose absence we now mourn. For their end is not called death but a slumber and a falling asleep. Wherefore also the blessed apostle forbids us to sorrow concerning them which are asleep, <span class="stiki" id="note302275"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:13</a></span> telling us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that those whom we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to sleep now may hereafter be roused from their sleep, and when their slumber is ended may watch once more with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and sing with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>:&mdash; <q>Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest and on earth peace among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of good will.</q>  In heaven where there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, there is <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and perpetual praise and unwearied singing; but on earth where sedition reigns, and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and discord hold sway, peace must be gained by <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and it is to be found not among all but only among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> of good will, who pay heed to the apostolic salutation: <q>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302277"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse7">Romans&nbsp;1:7</a></span> For <q>His abode is in peace and His dwelling place is in Zion,</q>  that is, on a watchtower,  on a height of doctrines and of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the believer; for the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of this latter daily beholds the face of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302280"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;18:10</a></span> and contemplates with unveiled face the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>2. Wherefore, though you are already running in the way, I urge a willing horse, as the saying goes, and implore you, while you regret in your Lucinius a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> brother, to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> as well that he now reigns with Christ. For, as it is written in the book of Wisdom, he was <q>taken away lest that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> should alter his understanding...for his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> pleased the Lord...and he...in a short time fulfilled a long time.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302281"><a href="../bible/wis004.htm#verse11">Wisdom&nbsp;4:11-14</a></span> We may with more right weep for ourselves that we stand daily in conflict with our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that we are stained with <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, that we receive wounds, and that we must give account for every idle word. <span class="stiki" id="note302282"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;12:36</a></span> Victorious now and free from care he looks down upon you from on high and supports you in your struggle, nay more, he prepares for you a place near to himself; for his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and affection towards you are still the same as when, disregarding his claim on you as a husband, he resolved to treat you even on earth as a sister, or indeed I may say as a brother, for difference of sex while essential to marriage is not so to a continent tie. And since even in the flesh, if we are born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we are no longer Greek and Barbarian, bond and free, male and female, but are all one in Him, <span class="stiki" id="note302283"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse28">Galatians&nbsp;3:28</a></span> how much more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> will this be when this corruptible has put on incorruption and when this mortal has put on <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302284"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span> <q>In the resurrection,</q> the Lord tells us, <q>they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels...in heaven.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302285"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;22:30</a></span> Now when it is said that they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven, there is no taking away of a natural and real body but only an indication of the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come. For the words are not <q>they shall be <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></q> but <q>they shall be as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a></q>: thus while likeness to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> is promised identity with them is refused. <q>They shall be,</q> Christ tells us, <q>as the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> that is like the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; therefore they will not cease to be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>. Glorious indeed they shall be, and graced with angelic splendour, but they will still be <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>; the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> will still be <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Mary will still be Mary. Then shall confusion overtake that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>  which holds out great but vague promises only that it may take away hopes which are at once modest and certain.</p>

<p>3. And now that I have once mentioned the word <q><a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>,</q> where can I find a trumpet loud enough to proclaim the eloquence of our dear Lucinius, who, when the filthy <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>  raged in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a> and like a pestilence ravaged the provinces between the Pyrenees and the ocean, upheld in all its purity the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the church and altogether refused to embrace Armagil, Barbelon, Abraxas, Balsamum, and the absurd Leusibora. Such are the portentous names which, to excite the minds of unlearned men and weak <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, they pretend to draw from Hebrew sources, terrifying the simple by barbarous combinations which they admire the more the less they understand them.  The growth of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is described for us by <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the <a href="../cathen/09472a.htm">church of Lyons</a>, a man of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostolic</a> times, who was a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> of <a href="../cathen/11457c.htm">Papias</a> the hearer of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> John. He informs us that a certain Mark,  of the stock of the gnostic <a href="../cathen/02326a.htm">Basilides</a>, came in the first instance to <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, that he contaminated with his teaching those parts of the country which are watered by the Rhone and the Garonne, and that in particular he misled by his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> high-born <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; to whom he promised certain secret <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and whose affection he enlisted by magic arts and hidden indulgence in unlawful intercourse. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> goes on to say that subsequently Mark crossed the Pyrenees and occupied <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>, making it his object to seek out the houses of the <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a>, and in these especially the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, concerning whom we are told that they are <q>led away with various <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, ever learning and never able to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302290"><a href="../bible/2ti003.htm#verse6">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:6-7</a></span> All this he wrote about three hundred years ago  in the extremely learned and eloquent books which he composed under the title <em>Against all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>.</em></p>

<p>4. From these facts you in your wisdom will realize how worthy of praise our dear Lucinius showed himself when he shut his ears that he might not have to hear the judgement passed upon blood shedders,  and dispersed all his substance and gave to the poor that his righteousness might endure for ever.  And not satisfied with bestowing his bounty upon his own country, he sent to the churches of Jerusalem and Alexandria gold enough to alleviate the want of large numbers. But while many will admire and extol in him this liberality, I for my part will rather praise him for his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and diligence in the study of the scriptures. With what eagerness he asked for my poor works! He actually sent six copyists (for in this province there is a dearth of <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> who understand Latin) to copy for him all that I have ever dictated from my youth until the present time. The <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> was not of course paid to me who am but a little child, the least of all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, living in the rocks near <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> myself a sinner; but to Christ who is honoured in his servants <span class="stiki" id="note302294"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;9:48</a></span> and who makes this promise to them, <q>He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.</q> </p>

<p>5. Therefore, my beloved daughter, regard this letter as the epitaph which <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> prompts me to write upon your husband, and if there is any spiritual work of which you think me to be capable, boldly command me to undertake it: that so ages to come may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that He who says of Himself in Isaiah, <q>He has made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302296"><a href="../bible/isa049.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;49:2</a></span> has with His sharp arrow so wounded two men severed by an immense interval of sea and land, that, although they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> each other not in the flesh, they are knit together in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in the spirit.</p>

<p>May you be kept <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in body and spirit by the <a href="../cathen/13416a.htm">Samaritan</a>&mdash; that is, saviour and keeper&mdash; of whom it is said in the psalm, <q>He that keeps <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall neither slumber nor sleep.</q>  May the watcher and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> one who came down to Daniel  come also to you, that you too may be able to say, <q>I sleep but my heart wakes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302299"><a href="../bible/son005.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;5:2</a></span> </p>
