<h1>Letter 76</h1>

<p> <em>To Uranius, Governor of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>.</em></p>

<p>True friendship is strengthened by intercourse, but separation cannot sunder it, for its bonds are strong. This <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might easily be shown by many other examples, but it is enough for us to verify what I say by our own case. Between me and you are indeed many things, mountains, cities, and the sea, yet nothing has destroyed my recollection of your excellency. No sooner do we behold any one arriving from those towns which lie on the coast, than the conversation is turned on <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> and on its right worthy governor, and we are delighted to have tidings of your high repute. And lately we have been gratified to an unusual degree at learning the most delightful news of all: for what, most excellent sir, can be more pleasing to us than to see your noble <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> illuminated by the light of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>? For we think it right that he who is adorned with many kinds of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should add to them also its colophon, and we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that we shall behold what we desire. For your nobility will doubtless eagerly seize the God-given boon, moved thereto by <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> friends who clearly understand its value, and guided to the bountiful God <q>Who wills all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be saved and to come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>,</q>  netting men by men's means to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and bringing them that He captures to the ageless life. The fisherman indeed deprives his prey of life, but our Fisher frees all that He takes alive from death's painful bonds, and therefore <q>did he show himself upon earth, and conversed with men,</q>  bringing men His life, conveying teaching by means of the visible manhood, and giving to reasonable beings the law of a suitable life and conversation. This law He has confirmed by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, and by the death of the flesh has destroyed death. By raising the flesh He has given the promise of resurrection to us all, after giving the resurrection of His own precious body as a worthy pledge of ours. So loved He men even when they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Him that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the &oelig;conomy fails to obtain credence with some on account of the very bitterness of His sufferings, and it is enough to show the depths of His loving kindness that He is even yet day by day calling to men who do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. And He does so not as though He were in need of the service of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>&mdash;for of what is the Creator of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> in want?&mdash; but because He thirsts for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of every man. Grasp then, my excellent friend, His gift; sing praises to the Giver, and procure for us a very great and right goodly feast.</p>
