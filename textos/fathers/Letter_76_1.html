<h1>Letter 76</h1>

<p><strong>To Abigaus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Abigaus the recipient of this letter was a blind <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> of B&aelig;tica in <a href="../cathen/14169b.htm">Spain</a>. He had asked the help of Jerome's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in his struggles with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and Jerome now writes to cheer and to console him. He concludes his remarks by commending to his special care the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> Theodora. The letter should be compared with that addressed to Castrutius (LXVIII.). It was written at the same time with the preceding.</span> </p>

<p>1. Although I am conscious of many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and every day <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> on bended knees, Remember not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of my youth nor my transgressions,  yet because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it has been said by the Apostle <q>let a man not be lifted up with <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> lest he fall into the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>,</q>  and that it is written in another passage, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> resists the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> but gives <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to the <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302302"><a href="../bible/jam004.htm#verse6">James&nbsp;4:6</a></span> there is nothing I have striven so much to avoid from my boyhood up as a swelling mind and a stiff neck,  things which always provoke against themselves the <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that my master and Lord and God has said in the lowliness of His flesh: <q>Learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302304"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;11:29</a></span> and that before this He has sung by the mouth of David: <q>Lord, remember David and all his gentleness.</q>  Again we read in another passage, <q>Before destruction the heart of man is <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">haughty</a>; and before <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is humility.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302306"><a href="../bible/pro018.htm#verse12">Proverbs&nbsp;18:12</a></span> Do not, then, I implore you, suppose that I have received your letter and have passed it over in silence. Do not, I beseech you, lay to my charge the dishonesty and negligence of which others have been guilty. For why should I, when called on to respond to your kind advances, continue dumb and repel by my silence the friendship which you offer? I who am always forward to seek intimate relations with the good and even to thrust myself upon their affection. <q>Two,</q> we read, <q>are better than one....for if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow....a three fold cord is not quickly broken, and a brother that helps his brother shall be exalted.</q>  Write to me, therefore, boldly, and overcome the effect of absence by frequent colloquies.</p>

<p>2. You should not grieve that you are destitute of those bodily eyes which ants, flies, and creeping things have as well as men; rather you should <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that you possess that eye of which it is said in the Song of Songs, <q>You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302308"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:9</a></span> This is the eye with which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is seen and to which <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> refers when he says:&mdash; <q>I will now turn aside and see this great sight.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302309"><a href="../bible/exo003.htm#verse3">Exodus&nbsp;3:3</a></span> We even read of some <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> of this world  that they have plucked out their eyes in order to turn all their thoughts upon the pure depths of the mind. And a <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> has said <q>Death has entered through your windows.</q>  Our Lord too tells the Apostles: <q>Whosoever looks upon a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after her has committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> with her already in his heart.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302312"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> Consequently they are commanded to lift up their eyes and to look on the fields, for these are white and ready for harvest. <span class="stiki" id="note302313"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;4:35</a></span> </p>

<p>3. You request me by my exhortations to slay in you <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> and Rabshakeh and Nebuzar-adan and Holofernes.  Were they alive in you, you would never have sought my aid. No, they are dead within you, and you have begun to build up the ruins of Jerusalem with the help of Zerubbabel and of Joshua the son of Josedech the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a>, of Ezra and of Nehemiah. You do not put your wages into a bag with holes, <span class="stiki" id="note302315"><a href="../bible/hag001.htm#verse6">Haggai&nbsp;1:6</a></span> but you lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, <span class="stiki" id="note302316"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;6:20</a></span> and if you seek my friendship, it is because you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me to be a servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>I commend to you&mdash; although she needs no commendation but her own&mdash; my <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> daughter Theodora, formerly the wife or rather the sister of Lucinius of blessed memory. Tell her that she must not grow weary of the path upon which she has entered, and that she can only reach the Holy Land by toiling through the wilderness. Warn her against supposing that the work of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is perfected when she has made her exodus from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. Remind her that she must pass through snares innumerable to arrive at <a href="../cathen/10729a.htm">Mount Nebo</a> and the River Jordan, <span class="stiki" id="note302317"><a href="../bible/num033.htm#verse47">Numbers&nbsp;33:47-48</a></span> that she must receive <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> anew at Gilgal,  that <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> must fall before her, overthrown by the blasts of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> trumpets, <span class="stiki" id="note302319"><a href="../bible/jos006.htm#verse20">Joshua&nbsp;6:20</a></span> that Adoni-zedec must be slain,  that Ai and Hazor, once fairest of cities, must both fall. </p>

<p>The brothers who are with me in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> salute you, and I through you earnestly salute those reverend <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who deign to bestow upon me their regard.</p>
