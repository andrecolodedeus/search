<h1>Letter 77</h1>

<p><strong>To Oceanus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">The eulogy of Fabiola whose restless life had come to an end in 399 A.D. Jerome tells the story of her <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and of her penitence (for which see Letter LV.), of the hospital established by her at Portus, of her visit to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>, and of her earnestness in the study of scripture. He relates how he wrote for her his account of the vestments of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> (Letter LXIV.) and how at the time of her death he was at her request engaged upon a commentary on the forty-two halting-places of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a> in the wilderness (Letter LXXIX.). This last he now sends along with this letter to Oceanus. Jerome also bestows praise upon Pammachius as the companion of all Fabiola's labours. The date of the letter is 399 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. Several years since I consoled the venerated <a href="../cathen/11582a.htm">Paula</a>, while her affliction was still recent for the falling asleep of Bl&aelig;silla.  Four summers ago I wrote for the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Heliodorus the epitaph of Nepotian, and expended what ability I possessed in giving expression to my grief at his loss.  Only two years have elapsed since I sent a brief letter to my dear Pammachius on the sudden flitting of his Paulina.  I blushed to say more to one so learned or to give him back his own thoughts: lest I should seem less the consoler of a friend than the officious instructor of one already perfect. But now, Oceanus my son, the duty that you lay upon me is one that I gladly accept and would even seek unasked. For when new <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> have to be dealt with, an old subject itself becomes new. In previous cases I have had to soften and restrain a mother's affection, an uncle's grief, and a husband's yearning; according to the different requirements of each I have had to apply from scripture different remedies.</p>

<p>2. Today you give me as my theme Fabiola, the praise of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, the marvel of the gentiles, the sorrow of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and the consolation of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Whatever point in her character I choose to treat of first, pales into insignificance compared with those which follow after. Shall I praise her <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>? Her <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> are greater still. Shall I commend her lowliness? The glow of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is yet brighter. Shall I mention her studied plainness in dress, her <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> choice of plebeian costume and the garb of a slave that she might put to shame silken robes? To change one's disposition is a greater achievement than to change one's dress. It is harder for us to part with arrogance than with gold and gems. For, even though we throw away these, we plume ourselves sometimes on a meanness that is really ostentatious, and we make a bid with a saleable poverty for the popular applause. But a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that seeks concealment and is cherished in the inner consciousness appeals to no judgement but that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thus the eulogies which I have to bestow upon Fabiola will be altogether new: I must neglect the order of the rhetoricians and begin all I have to say only from the cradle of her conversion and of her penitence. Another writer, mindful of the school, would perhaps bring forward Quintus Maximus, <q>the man who by delaying rescued Rome,</q>  and the whole Fabian <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>; he would describe their struggles and battles and would exult that Fabiola had come to us through a line so noble, showing that qualities not apparent in the branch still <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the root. But as I am a lover of the inn at <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a> and of the Lord's stable in which the virgin travailed with and gave birth to an infant <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I shall deduce the lineage of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> handmaid not from a stock famous in history but from the lowliness of the church.</p>

<p>3. And because at the very outset there is a rock in the path and she is overwhelmed by a storm of censure, for having forsaken her first husband and having taken a second, I will not praise her for her conversion till I have first cleared her of this charge. So terrible then were the faults imputed to her former husband that not even a prostitute or a common slave could have put up with them. If I were to recount them, I should undo the heroism of the wife who chose to bear the blame of a separation rather than to blacken the character and expose the stains of him who was one body with her. I will only urge this one plea which is sufficient to exonerate a chaste matron and a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. The Lord has given commandment that a wife must not be put away <q>except it be for fornication, and that, if put away, she must remain unmarried.</q>  Now a commandment which is given to men <a href="../cathen/09324a.htm">logically</a> applies to <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also. For it cannot be that, while an adulterous wife is to be put away, an incontinent husband is to be retained. The apostle says: <q>he which is joined to an harlot is one body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302327"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> Therefore she also who is joined to a whoremonger and unchaste person is made one body with him. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of C&aelig;sar are different, it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, from the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of Christ: Papinianus  commands one thing; our own <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> another. Earthly <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> give a free rein to the unchastity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, merely condemning seduction and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is allowed to range unrestrained among brothels and slave girls, as if the guilt were constituted by the rank of the person assailed and not by the purpose of the assailant. But with us <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> what is unlawful for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> is equally unlawful for men, and as both serve the same God both are bound by the same <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a>. Fabiola then has put away&mdash; they are quite right&mdash; a husband that was a sinner, guilty of this and that crime, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash; I have almost mentioned their names&mdash; with which the whole neighbourhood resounded but which the wife alone refused to disclose. If however it is made a charge against her that after repudiating her husband she did not continue unmarried, I readily admit this to have been a fault, but at the same time declare that it may have been a case of necessity. <q>It is better,</q> the apostle tells us, <q>to marry than to burn.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302329"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:9</a></span> She was quite a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, she was not able to continue in widowhood. In the words of the apostle she saw another law in her members warring against the law of her mind; <span class="stiki" id="note302330"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;7:23</a></span> she felt herself dragged in chains as a captive towards the indulgences of wedlock. Therefore she thought it better openly to confess her weakness and to accept the semblance of an unhappy marriage than, with the name of a monogamist, to ply the trade of a courtesan. The same apostle wills that the younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> should marry, bear children, and give no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. <span class="stiki" id="note302331"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:14</a></span> And he at once goes on to explain his wish: <q>for some are already turned aside after <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302332"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:15</a></span> Fabiola therefore was fully persuaded in her own mind: she thought she had acted legitimately in putting away her husband, and that when she had done so she was free to marry again. She did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the rigour of the gospel takes away from <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> all pretexts for re-marriage so long as their former husbands are alive; and not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, though she contrived to evade other assaults of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, she at this point unwittingly exposed herself to a wound from him.</p>

<p>4. But why do I linger over old and forgotten matters, seeking to excuse a fault for which Fabiola has herself confessed her penitence? Who would <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, after the death of her second husband at a time when most <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, having shaken off the yoke of servitude, grow careless and allow themselves more liberty than ever, frequenting the baths, flitting through the streets, showing their harlot faces everywhere; that at this time Fabiola came to herself? Yet it was then that she put on sackcloth to make public confession of her <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. It was then that in the presence of all Rome (in the <a href="../cathen/02325a.htm">basilica</a> which formerly belonged to that Lateranus who perished by the sword of C&aelig;sar ) she stood in the ranks of the penitents and exposed before <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and people&mdash; all of whom wept when they saw her weep&mdash; her dishevelled hair, pale features, soiled hands and unwashed neck. What <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> would such a penance fail to purge away? What ingrained stains would such tears be unable to wash out? By a threefold confession Peter blotted out his threefold denial.  If <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> committed sacrilege by fashioning molten gold into the head of a calf, his brother's <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> made amends for his transgressions. <span class="stiki" id="note302335"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm#verse30">Exodus&nbsp;32:30-35</a></span> If <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> David, meekest of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, committed the double <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, he atoned for it by a fast of seven days. He lay upon the earth, he rolled in the ashes, he forgot his royal power, he sought for light in the darkness. <span class="stiki" id="note302336"><a href="../bible/2sa012.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;12:16</a></span> And then, turning his eyes to that God whom he had so deeply offended, he cried with a lamentable voice: <q>Against you, you only, have I <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, and done this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in your sight,</q> and <q>Restore unto me the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and uphold me with your free spirit.</q>  He who by his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> teaches me how to stand and not to fall, by his penitence teaches me how, if I fall, I may rise again. Among the kings do we read of any so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> as Ahab, of whom the scripture says: <q>there was none like Ahab which did sell himself to work <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> in the sight of the Lord</q>?  For shedding Naboth's blood Elijah rebuked him, and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> denounced God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> against him: <q>Have you killed and also taken possession?...behold I will bring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon you and will take away your posterity</q>  and so on. Yet when Ahab heard these words <q>he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted...in sackcloth, and went softly.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302340"><a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;21:27</a></span> Then came the word of God to Elijah the Tishbite saying: <q>Do you see how Ahab <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself before me? Because he <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humbles</a> himself before me, I will not bring the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in his days.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302341"><a href="../bible/1ki021.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;21:28-29</a></span> O <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> penitence which has drawn down upon itself the eyes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and which has by confessing its <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> changed the sentence of God's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>! The same conduct is in the Chronicles <span class="stiki" id="note302342"><a href="../bible/2ch033.htm#verse12">2&nbsp;Chronicles&nbsp;33:12-13</a></span> attributed to Manasseh, and in the book of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Jonah <span class="stiki" id="note302343"><a href="../bible/jon003.htm#verse5">Jonah&nbsp;3:5-10</a></span> to Nineveh, and in the gospel to the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302344"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse13">Luke&nbsp;18:13</a></span> The first of these not only was allowed to obtain forgiveness but also recovered his kingdom, the second broke the force of God's impending <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, while the third, smiting his breast with his hands, <q>would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven.</q> Yet for all that the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> with his <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> confession of his faults went back justified far more than the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisee</a> with his arrogant boasting of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>. This is not however the place to preach penitence, neither am I writing against <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and Novatus.  Else would I say of it that it is <q>a sacrifice...well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q>  I would cite the words of the psalmist: <q>the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of God are a broken spirit,</q>  and those of Ezekiel <q>I prefer the repentance of a sinner rather than his death,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302348"><a href="../bible/eze018.htm#verse23">Ezekiel&nbsp;18:23</a></span> and those of Baruch, <q>Arise, arise, O Jerusalem,</q>  and many other proclamations made by the trumpets of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</p>

<p>5. But this one thing I will say, for it is at once useful to my readers and pertinent to my present theme. As Fabiola was not ashamed of the Lord on earth, so He shall not be ashamed of her in heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note302350"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse26">Luke&nbsp;9:26</a></span> She laid bare her wound to the gaze of all, and Rome beheld with tears the disfiguring scar which marred her beauty. She uncovered her limbs, bared her head, and closed her mouth. She no longer entered the church of God but, like Miriam the sister of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302351"><a href="../bible/num012.htm#verse14">Numbers&nbsp;12:14</a></span> she sat apart without the camp, till the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who had cast her out should himself call her back. She came down like the daughter of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> from the throne of her daintiness, she took the millstones and ground meal, she passed barefooted through rivers of tears. <span class="stiki" id="note302352"><a href="../bible/isa047.htm#verse1">Isaiah&nbsp;47:1-2</a></span> She sat upon the coals of fire, and these became her aid.  That face by which she had once pleased her second husband she now smote with blows; she <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> jewels, shunned ornaments and could not bear to look upon fine linen.  In fact she bewailed the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> she had committed as bitterly as if it had been <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and went to the expense of many remedies in her eagerness to cure her one wound.</p>

<p>6. Having found myself aground in the shallows of Fabiola's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, I have dwelt thus long upon her penitence in order that I might open up a larger and quite unimpeded space for the description of her praises. Restored to communion before the eyes of the whole church, what did she do? In the day of prosperity she was not forgetful of affliction; <span class="stiki" id="note302355"><a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse25">Sirach&nbsp;11:25</a></span> and, having once suffered shipwreck she was unwilling again to face the risks of the sea. Instead therefore of re-embarking on her old life, she broke up  and sold all that she could lay hands on of her property (it was large and suitable to her rank), and turning it into money she laid out this for the benefit of the poor. She was the first person to found a hospital, into which she might gather sufferers out of the streets, and where she might nurse the unfortunate victims of sickness and want. Need I now recount the various ailments of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings? Need I speak of noses slit, eyes put out, feet half burnt, hands covered with sores? Or of limbs dropsical and atrophied? Or of diseased flesh alive with worms? Often did she carry on her own shoulders <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> infected with jaundice or with filth. Often too did she wash away the matter discharged from wounds which others, even though men, could not bear to look at. She gave food to her patients with her own hand, and moistened the scarce breathing lips of the dying with sips of liquid. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of many <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> and devout <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who, unable to overcome their natural repugnance to such sights, perform this work of mercy by the agency of others, giving money instead of personal aid. I do not blame them and am far from construing their weakness of resolution into a want of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. While however I pardon such squeamishness, I extol to the skies the enthusiastic <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> that is above it. A great <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> makes little of such trifles. But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how terrible was the retribution which fell upon the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> mind of the rich man clothed in purple for not having helped Lazarus. <span class="stiki" id="note302357"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;16:19-24</a></span> The poor wretch whom we despise, whom we cannot so much as look at, and the very sight of whom turns our stomachs, is <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> like ourselves, is made of the same clay as we are, is formed out of the same elements. All that he suffers we too may suffer. Let us then regard his wounds as though they were our own, and then all our insensibility to another's suffering will give way before our pity for ourselves.</p>

<blockquote><p>Not with a hundred tongues or throat of bronze
<br>Could I exhaust the forms of fell disease </p></blockquote>

<p>which Fabiola so wonderfully alleviated in the suffering poor that many of the healthy fell to envying the sick. However she showed the same liberality towards the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> and <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>. Was there a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> which was not supported by Fabiola's <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>? Was there a naked or bedridden person who was not clothed with garments supplied by her? Were there ever any in want to whom she failed to give a quick and unhesitating supply? Even Rome was not wide enough for her pity. Either in her own person or else through the agency of reverend and trustworthy men she went from island to island and carried her bounty not only round the Etruscan Sea, but throughout the district of the Volscians, as it stands along those secluded and winding shores where communities of <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> are to be found.</p>

<p>7. Suddenly she made up her <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, against the advice of all her friends, to take ship and to come to Jerusalem. Here she was welcomed by a large concourse of people and for a short time took advantage of my hospitality. Indeed, when I call to mind our meeting, I seem to see her here now instead of in the past. Blessed Jesus, what <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>, what earnestness she bestowed upon the sacred volumes! In her eagerness to satisfy what was a veritable craving she would run through Prophets, <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, and Psalms: she would suggest questions and treasure up the answers in the desk of her own bosom. And yet this eagerness  to hear did not bring with it any feeling of satiety: increasing her <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> she also increased her sorrow, <span class="stiki" id="note302359"><a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse18">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;1:18</a></span> and by casting oil upon the flame she did but supply fuel for a still more burning <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a>. One day we had before us the book of <em>Numbers</em> written by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, and she modestly questioned me as to the meaning of the great mass of names there to be found. Why was it, she inquired, that single tribes were differently associated in this passage and in that, how came it that the soothsayer Balaam in prophesying of the future <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Christ <span class="stiki" id="note302360"><a href="../bible/num024.htm#verse15">Numbers&nbsp;24:15-19</a></span> spoke more plainly of Him than almost any other <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>? I replied as best I could and tried to satisfy her enquiries. Then unrolling the book still farther she came to the passage  in which is given the list of all the halting-places by which the people after leaving <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> made its way to the waters of Jordan. And when she asked me the meaning and reason of each of these, I spoke doubtfully about some, dealt with others in a tone of assurance, and in several instances simply confessed my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. Hereupon she began to press me harder still, expostulating with me as though it were a thing unallowable that I should be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, yet at the same time affirming her own unworthiness to understand <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> so deep. In a word I was ashamed to refuse her request and allowed her to extort from me a promise that I would devote a special work to this subject for her use. Till the present time I have had to defer the fulfilment of my promise: as I now perceive, by the Will of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order that it should be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to her memory. As in a previous work  I clothed her with the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> vestments, so in the pages of the present  she may <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that she has passed through the wilderness of this world and has come at last to the land of promise.</p>

<p>8. But let me continue the task which I have begun. Whilst I was in search of a suitable dwelling for so great a lady, whose only conception of the solitary life included a place of resort like Mary's inn; suddenly messengers flew this way and that and the whole East was terror-struck. For news came that the hordes of the Huns had poured forth all the way from M&aelig;otis  (they had their haunts between the icy Tanais  and the rude Massaget&aelig;  where the gates of Alexander keep back the wild peoples behind the Caucasus); and that, speeding here and there on their nimble-footed horses, they were filling all the world with panic and bloodshed. The Roman army was absent at the time, being detained in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> on account of the civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>. Of these Huns Herodotus  tells us that under Darius King of the Medes they held the East in bondage for twenty years and that from the Egyptians and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a> they exacted a yearly tribute. May Jesus avert from the Roman world the farther assaults of these wild beasts! Everywhere their approach was unexpected, they outstripped rumour in speed, and, when they came, they spared neither religion nor rank nor age, even for wailing infants they had no pity. Children were forced to die before it could be said that they had begun to live; and little ones not realizing their miserable <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> might be seen smiling in the hands and at the weapons of their enemies. It was generally agreed that the goal of the invaders was Jerusalem and that it was their excessive desire for gold which made them hasten to this particular city. Its walls uncared for in time of peace were accordingly put in repair. <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> was in a state of siege. <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>, desirous of cutting itself off from the land, sought once more its ancient island. We too were compelled to man our ships and to lie off the shore as a precaution against the arrival of our foes. No matter how hard the winds might blow, we could not but dread the barbarians more than shipwreck. It was not, however, so much for our own safety that we were anxious as for the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> who were with us. Just at that time also there was dissension among us,  and our intestine struggles threw into the shade our battle with the barbarians. I myself clung to my long-settled abode in the East and gave way to my deep-seated <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places. Fabiola, used as she was to moving from city to city and having no other property but what her baggage contained, returned to her native land; to live in poverty where she had once been rich, to lodge in the house of another, she who in old days had lodged many guests in her own, and&mdash; not unduly to prolong my account&mdash; to bestow upon the poor before the eyes of Rome the proceeds of that property which Rome <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> her to have sold.</p>

<p>9. This only do I lament that in her the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> places lost a necklace of the loveliest. Rome recovered what it had previously parted with, and the wanton and <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slanderous</a> tongues of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> were confuted by the testimony of their own eyes. Others may commend her pity, her humility, her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: I will rather praise her ardour of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. The letter  in which as a young man I once urged Heliodorus to the life of a hermit she <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> by heart, and whenever she looked upon the walls of Rome she complained that she was in a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>. Forgetful of her sex, unmindful of her frailty, and only desiring to be alone she was in fact there  where her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> lingered. The counsels of her friends could not hold her back; so eager was she to burst from the city as from a place of bondage. Nor did she leave the distribution of her <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to others; she distributed them herself. Her wish was that, after equitably dispensing her money to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, she might herself find support from others for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. In such haste was she and so impatient of delay that you would fancy her on the eve of her departure. As she was always ready, death could not find her unprepared.</p>

<p>10. As I pen her praises, my dear Pammachius seems suddenly to rise before me. His wife Paulina sleeps that he may keep vigil; she has gone before her husband that he remaining behind may be Christ's servant. Although he was his wife's heir, others&mdash; I mean the poor&mdash; are now in possession of his inheritance. He and Fabiola contended for the privilege of setting up a tent like that of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>  at Portus. The contest which arose between them was for the supremacy in showing kindness. Each conquered and each was overcome. Both admitted themselves to be at once victors and vanquished for what each had desired to effect alone both accomplished together. They united their resources and combined their plans that harmony might forward what rivalry must have brought to nought. No sooner was the scheme broached than it was carried out. A house was purchased to serve as a shelter, and a crowd flocked into it. <q>There was no more travail in Jacob nor distress in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  The seas carried voyagers to find a welcome here on landing. Travellers left Rome in haste to take advantage of the mild coast before setting sail. What Publius once did in the island of Malta for one apostle and&mdash; not to leave room for gainsaying&mdash; for a single ship's crew, <span class="stiki" id="note302373"><a href="../bible/act028.htm#verse7">Acts&nbsp;28:7</a></span> Fabiola and Pammachius have done over and over again for large numbers; and not only have they supplied the wants of the destitute, but so universal has been their munificence that they have provided additional means for those who have something already. The whole world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that a home for strangers has been established at Portus; and Britain has learned in the summer what <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Parthia <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> in the spring.</p>

<p>11. In the death of this noble lady we have seen a fulfilment of the apostle's words:&mdash; <q>All things work together for good to them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> God.</q>  Having a presentiment of what would happen, she had written to several <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> to come and release her from the burden under which she laboured;  for she wished to make to herself friends of the <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a> of unrighteousness that they might receive her into everlasting habitations. <span class="stiki" id="note302376"><a href="../bible/luk016.htm#verse9">Luke&nbsp;16:9</a></span> They came to her and she made them her friends; she fell asleep in the way that she had wished, and having at last laid aside her burden she soared more lightly up to heaven. How great a marvel Fabiola had been to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> while she lived came out in the behaviour of the people now that she was dead. Hardly had she breathed her last breath, hardly had she given back her <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to Christ whose it was when</p>

<blockquote><p>Flying Rumour heralding the woe </p></blockquote>

<p>gathered the entire city to attend her obsequies. Psalms were chaunted and the gilded ceilings of the temples were shaken with uplifted shouts of <a href="../cathen/01319b.htm">Alleluia</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The choirs of young and old extolled her <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>
<br>And sang the praises of her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. </p></blockquote>

<p>Her triumph was more <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> far than those won by Furius over the Gauls, by Papirius over the Samnites, by Scipio over Numantia, by Pompey over <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>. They had conquered physical force, she had mastered spiritual iniquities. <span class="stiki" id="note302379"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse12">Ephesians&nbsp;6:12</a></span> I seem to hear even now the squadrons which led the van of the procession, and the sound of the feet of the multitude which thronged in thousands to attend her funeral. The streets, porches, and roofs from which a view could be obtained were inadequate to accommodate the spectators. On that day Rome saw all her peoples gathered together in one, and each person present flattered himself that he had some part in the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of her penitence. No wonder indeed that men should thus exult in the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of one at whose conversion there was <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> among the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note302380"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse7">Luke&nbsp;15:7,&nbsp;10</a></span> </p>

<p>12. I give you this, Fabiola,  the best gift of my aged powers, to be as it were a funeral offering. Oftentimes have I praised <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> and <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> and married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who have kept their garments always white  and who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. <span class="stiki" id="note302383"><a href="../bible/rev014.htm#verse4">Revelation&nbsp;14:4</a></span> Happy indeed is she in her encomium who throughout her life has been stained by no defilement. But let <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> depart and censoriousness be silent. If the father of the house is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> why should our eye be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? <span class="stiki" id="note302384"><a href="../bible/mat020.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;20:15</a></span> The <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which fell among thieves has been carried home upon the shoulders of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  In our father's house are many mansions. <span class="stiki" id="note302386"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;14:2</a></span> Where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> has much more abounded. <span class="stiki" id="note302387"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> To whom more is forgiven the same loves more. <span class="stiki" id="note302388"><a href="../bible/luk007.htm#verse47">Luke&nbsp;7:47</a></span> </p>
