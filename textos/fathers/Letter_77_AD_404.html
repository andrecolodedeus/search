<h1>Letter 77 (A.D. 404)</h1>

<p> <em>To Felix and Hilarinus, My Lords most Beloved, and Brethren Worthy of All Honour, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. I do not wonder to see the minds of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> disturbed by <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, whom resist, continuing in the hope which rests on the promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who cannot lie, who has not only condescended to promise in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a> rewards to us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and hope in Him, and who persevere in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> unto the end, but has also foretold that in time offenses by which our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must be tried and <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> shall not be wanting; for He said, <q>Because iniquity shall abound, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many shall wax cold;</q> but He added immediately, <q>and he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note111969"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;24:12-13</a></span> Why, therefore, should it seem strange that men bring <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and being unable to turn them aside from an upright life, endeavour to blacken their <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, seeing that they do not cease uttering <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> daily against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord of these servants, if they are displeased by anything in which the execution of His righteous and secret counsel is contrary to their desire? Wherefore I appeal to your wisdom, my lords most beloved, and brethren worthy of all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and exhort you to exercise your minds in the way which best becomes <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, setting over against the empty <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> and groundless suspicions of men the written word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has foretold that these things should come, and has warned us to meet them with <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a>.</p>

<p>2. Let me therefore say in a few words to your Charity, that the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Boniface has not been discovered by me to be guilty of any crime, and that I have never <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and do not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, any charge brought against him. How, then, could I order his name to be deleted from the roll of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, when filled with alarm by that word of our Lord in the gospel: <q>With what judgment ye judge you shall be judged</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note111970"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;7:2</a></span> For, seeing that the dispute which has arisen between him and Spes has by their consent been submitted to divine arbitration in a way which, if you desire it, can be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you,  who am I, that I should presume to anticipate the divine award by deleting or passing over his name? As a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, I ought not rashly to suspect him; and as being only a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, I cannot decide infallibly concerning things which are hidden from me. Even in secular matters, when an appeal has been made to a higher authority, all procedure is sisted while the case awaits the decision from which there is no appeal; because if anything were changed while the matter is depending on his arbitration, this would be an insult to the higher tribunal. And how great the distance between even the highest <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authority and the divine!</p>

<p>May the mercy of the Lord our God never forsake you, my lords most beloved, and brethren worthy of all <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>
