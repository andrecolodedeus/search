<h1>Letter 79</h1>

<p>Leo, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> to Pulcheria Augusta.</p>

<h2>I. He rejoices at Pulcheria's zeal both against Nestorius and Eutyches.</h2>

<p>That which we have always anticipated concerning your Grace's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> purposes, we have now <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> fully <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, viz. that, however varied may be the attacks of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men upon the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> Faith, yet when you are present and prepared by the Lord for its defence, it cannot be disturbed. For God will not forsake either the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of His mercy or the deserts of your labours, whereby you long ago repelled the crafty foe of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion from the very vitals of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>: when the impiety of <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> failed to maintain his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> because it did not escape you the handmaid and pupil of the Truth, how much poison was instilled into simple folk by the coloured falsehoods of that glib fellow. And the sequel to that mighty struggle was that through your vigilance the things which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> contrived by means of Eutyches, did not escape detection, and they who had chosen to themselves one side in the twofold <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, were overthrown by the one and undivided power of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith. This then is your second victory over the destruction of Eutyches' <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>: and, if he had had any soundness of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> having been once and long ago routed and put to confusion in the person of his instigators, he would easily have been able to avoid the attempt to rekindle into life the smouldering ashes, and thus only share the lot of those, whose example he had followed, most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Augusta. We desire, therefore, to leap for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and to pay due vows for your clemency's prosperity to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has already bestowed on you a double palm and crown through all the parts of the world, in which the Lord's <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is proclaimed.</p>

<h2>II. He thanks her for her aid to the Catholic cause, and explains his wishes about the restoration of the lapsed bishops.</h2>

<p>Your clemency must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, therefore, that the whole church of Rome is highly grateful for all your faithful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, whether that you have with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> helped our representatives throughout and brought back the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, who had been expelled from their churches by an <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> sentence, or that you have procured the restoration with due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the remains of that innocent and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, Flavian, of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, to the church, which he ruled so well. In all which things assuredly your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is increased manifold, so long as you venerate the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> according to their deserts, and are anxious that the thorns and weeds should be removed from the Lord's field. But we learn as well from the account of our deputies as from that of my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Anatolius, whom you graciously recommend to me, that certain <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> crave reconciliation for those who seem to have given their consent to matters of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and desire <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion for them: to whose request we grant effect on condition that the boon of peace should not be vouchsafed them till, our deputies acting in concert with the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, they are corrected, and with their own hand condemn their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> doings; because our <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a> requires both that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> should constrain the obstinate, and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not reject the penitent.</p>

<h2>III. He commends certain bishops and churches to her care.</h2>

<p>And because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how much <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> care your Grace deigns to bestow on <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, we have ordered that you should be informed that my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Eusebius, is living with us, and sharing our communion, whose church we commend to you; for he that is improperly asserted to have been elected in his place, is said to be ravaging it. And this too we ask of your Grace, which we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> not you will do of your own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>, to extend the favour which is due as well to my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Julian, as to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> of Constantinople, who clung to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Flavian with faithful loyalty. On all things we have instructed your Grace by our deputies as to what ought to be done or arranged. Dated April 13, in the consulship of the illustrious Adelfius (451).</p>
