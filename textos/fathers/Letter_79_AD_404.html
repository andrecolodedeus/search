<h1>Letter 79 (A.D. 404)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">A short and stern challenge to some <a href="../cathen/09591a.htm">Manich&aelig;an</a> teacher who had succeeded Fortunatus (supposed to be Felix).</span> </p>

<p>Your attempts at evasion are to no purpose: your real character is patent even a long way off. My brethren have reported to me their conversation with you. You say that you do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> death; it is well: but you ought to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that death which you are bringing upon yourself by your <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> assertions concerning God. As to your understanding that the visible death which all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is a separation between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, this is a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which demands no great grasp of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>. But as to the statement which you annex to this, that death is a separation between good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, do you not see that, if the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> be good and the body be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he who joined them together,  is not good? But you affirm that the good God has joined them together; from which it follows that He is either <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, or swayed by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of one who is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Yet you boast of your having no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, when at the same time you conceive God to be such that, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Darkness, He would join together good and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Be not uplifted, as your writing shows you to be, by supposing that I magnify you, by my resolving to check the out-flowing of your poison, lest its insidious and pestilential power should do harm: for the apostle does not magnify those whom he calls <q>dogs,</q> saying to the Philippians, <q>Beware of dogs;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112007"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse2">Philippians&nbsp;3:2</a></span> nor does he magnify those of whom he says that their word does eat as a canker. <span class="stiki" id="note112008"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:17</a></span> Therefore, in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I demand of you to answer, if you are able, the question which baffled your predecessor Fortunatus.  For he went from the scene of our discussion declaring that he would not return, unless, after conferring with his party, he found something by which he could answer the arguments used by our brethren. And if you are not prepared to do this, begone from this place, and do not pervert the right ways of the Lord, ensnaring and infecting with your poison the minds of the weak, lest, by the Lord's right hand helping me, you be put to confusion in a way which you did not expect.</p>
