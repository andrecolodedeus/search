<h1>Letter 7</h1>

<p> <em>For 335. Easter-day iv Pharmuthi, iii Kal. April; xx Moon; &AElig;r. Dioclet. 51; Coss. Julius Constantius, the brother of Augustus, Rufinus Albinus; Pr&aelig;fect, the same Philagrius; viii Indict.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>  wrote to the Corinthians <span class="stiki" id="note284131"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:10</a></span> that he always bore in his body the dying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, not as though he alone should make that boast, but also they and we too, and in this let us be followers of him, my brethren. And let this be the customary boast of all of us at all times. In this David participated, saying in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, 'For your sake we die all the day; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. ' Now this is becoming in us, especially in the days of the feast, when a commemoration of the death of our <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Saviour</a> is held. For he who is made like Him in His death, is also diligent in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> practices, having mortified his members which are upon the earth <span class="stiki" id="note284133"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span>, and crucifying the flesh with the affections and <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, he lives in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and is conformed to the Spirit. <span class="stiki" id="note284134"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse25">Galatians&nbsp;5:25</a></span> He is always mindful of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and forgets Him not, and never does the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of death. Now, in order that we may bear in our body the dying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, he immediately adds the way of such fellowship, saying, 'we having the same spirit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as it is written, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and therefore have I spoken; we also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and therefore speak <span class="stiki" id="note284135"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse13">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:13</a></span>.' He adds also, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> that arises from <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; 'For He that raised up Jesus, will also raise us up with Jesus, and will present us before Him with you. '</p>

<p>2. When by such <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have embraced this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, they receive, doubtless, the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>; for which the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> not caring, are deservedly deprived of the blessedness arising from it. For, 'let the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> be taken away, so that he shall not see the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord. ' For although, when they shall hear the universal proclamation of the promise, 'Awake, you that sleepest, and arise from the dead <span class="stiki" id="note284138"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;5:14</a></span>,' they shall rise and shall come even to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, knocking and saying, 'Open to us <span class="stiki" id="note284139"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;25:11</a></span>;' nevertheless the Lord will reprove them, as those who put the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Himself far from them, saying, 'I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you not.' But the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Spirit cries against them, 'The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> shall be turned into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>, even all the nations that forget God.. ' Now we say that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> are dead, but not in an <a href="../cathen/01767c.htm">ascetic</a> life opposed to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; nor do they, like the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, bear about dying in their bodies. But it is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which they bury in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and follies, drawing near to the dead, and satisfying it with dead nourishment; like young eagles which, from high places, fly upon the carcasses of the dead, and which the law prohibited, commanding figuratively, 'You shall not eat the eagle, nor any other bird that feeds on a dead carcass <span class="stiki" id="note284141"><a href="../bible/lev011.htm#verse13">Leviticus&nbsp;11:13</a></span>;' and it pronounced unclean whatsoever eats the dead. But these kill the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>, and say nothing but, 'let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die <span class="stiki" id="note284142"><a href="../bible/isa022.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;22:13</a></span>.' And the kind of fruit those have who thus <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> pleasures, he immediately describes, adding, 'And these things are revealed in the ears of the Lord of Hosts, that this <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> shall not be forgiven you until you die. ' Yea, even while they live they shall be ashamed, because they consider their belly their lord; and when dead, they shall be tormented, because they have made a boast of such a death. To this effect also <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, saying, 'Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them <span class="stiki" id="note284144"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:13</a></span>.' And the divine word declared before concerning them; 'The death of sinners is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the righteous commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. ' For bitter is the worm, and grievous the darkness, which <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men inherit.</p>

<p>3. But the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, and they who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> practise <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, 'mortify their members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscence <span class="stiki" id="note284146"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span>;' and, as the result of this, are pure and without spot, confiding in the promise of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Saviour</a>, who said, 'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God <span class="stiki" id="note284147"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span>.' These, having become dead to the world, and renounced the merchandise of the world, gain an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> death; for, 'precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. ' They are also able, preserving the Apostolic likeness, to say, 'I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me <span class="stiki" id="note284149"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse20">Galatians&nbsp;2:20</a></span>.' For that is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life, which a man lives in Christ; for although they are dead to the world, yet they dwell as it were in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">heaven</a>, minding those things which are above, as he who was a lover of such a habitation said, 'While we walk on earth, our dwelling is in heaven. ' Now those who thus live, and are partakers in such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, are alone able to give <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and this it is which essentially constitutes a feast and a holiday.  For the feast does not consist in pleasant intercourse at meals, nor splendour  of clothing, nor days of leisure, but in the acknowledgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the offering of thanksgiving and of praise to Him.  Now this belongs to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> alone, who live in Christ; for it is written, 'The dead shall not praise You, O Lord, neither all those who go down into silence; but we who live will bless the Lord, from henceforth even for ever. ' So was it with Hezekiah, who was delivered from death, and therefore praised <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying, 'Those who are in hades cannot praise You; the dead cannot bless You; but the living shall bless You, as I also do <span class="stiki" id="note284155"><a href="../bible/isa038.htm#verse18">Isaiah&nbsp;38:18</a></span>.' For to praise and bless God belongs to those only who live in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and by means of this they go up to the feast; for the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> is not of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, nor of those who are yet <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in the flesh; but of those who acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in Christ , as he declares who was sent to proclaim such a feast; 'Our <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, Christ, is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284157"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:7</a></span>.'</p>

<p>4. Therefore, although <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men press forward to keep the feast, and as at a feast praise <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and intrude into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, yet God expostulates, saying to the sinner, 'Why do you talk of My ordinances?' And the gentle Spirit rebukes them, saying, 'Praise is not comely in the mouth of a sinner. ' Neither has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> any place in common with the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for the sinner has a mouth speaking perverse things, as the Proverb says, 'The mouth of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> answers <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things <span class="stiki" id="note284159"><a href="../bible/pro015.htm#verse28">Proverbs&nbsp;15:28</a></span>.' For how is it possible for us to praise God with an impure mouth? Since things which are contrary to each other cannot coexist. For what communion has righteousness with iniquity? Or, what fellowship is there between light and darkness? So exclaims <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a minister of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284160"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> .</p>

<p>Thus it is that sinners, and all those who are aliens from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and schismatics, since they are excluded from glorifying (God) with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, cannot properly even continue observers of the feast. But the righteous man, although he appears dying to the world, uses boldness of speech, saying, 'I shall not die, but live, and narrate all Your marvelous <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. ' For even God is not ashamed to be called the God  of those who <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> mortify their members which are upon the earth , but live in Christ; for He is the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the living, not of the dead. And He by His living Word quickens all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and gives Him to be food and life to the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>; as the Lord declares, 'I am the bread of life <span class="stiki" id="note284164"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse48">John&nbsp;6:48</a></span>.' The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, because they were weak in perception, and had not exercised the senses of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and did not comprehend this discourse about bread, murmured against Him, because He said, 'I am the bread which came down from heaven, and gives life unto men. '</p>

<p>5. For <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has her own special bread, of her death, and calling to those who are lovers of pleasure and lack understanding, she says, 'Touch with delight secret bread, and sweet waters which are stolen <span class="stiki" id="note284166"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse17">Proverbs&nbsp;9:17</a></span>;' for he who merely touches them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that that which is born from the earth perishes with her. For even when the sinner thinks to find pleasure, the end of that food is not pleasant, as the Wisdom of God says again, 'Bread of deceit is pleasant to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. ' And, 'Honey drops from the lips of a whorish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, which for a time is sweet to your palate; but at the last you shall find it more bitter than gall, and sharper than a two-edged sword. ' Thus then he eats and rejoices for a little time; afterwards he spurns it when he has removed his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> afar. For the fool <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not that those who depart far from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall perish. And besides, there is the restraint of the prophetic admonition which says, 'What have you to do in the way of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to drink the waters of Gihon? And what have you to do in the way of Asshur, to drink the waters of the rivers <span class="stiki" id="note284169"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse18">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:18</a></span>?' And the Wisdom of God which loves <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> forbids these things, crying, 'But depart quickly, tarry not in the place, neither fix your eye upon it; for thus you shall pass over strange waters, and depart quickly from the strange river. ' She also calls them to herself, 'For wisdom has built her house, and supported it on seven pillars; she has killed her <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and mingled her wine in the goblets, and prepared her table; she has sent forth her servants, inviting to the goblet with a loud proclamation, and saying, Whoso is foolish, let him turn in to me; and to them that lack understanding she says, Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine I have mingled for you <span class="stiki" id="note284171"><a href="../bible/pro009.htm#verse1">Proverbs&nbsp;9:1-5</a></span>.' And what hope is there instead of these things? 'Forsake folly that you may live, and seek understanding that you may abide. ' For the bread of Wisdom is living fruit, as the Lord said; 'I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever <span class="stiki" id="note284173"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span>.' For when <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> ate of the manna, which was indeed pleasant and wonderful, yet he died, and he who ate it did not in consequence live for ever, but all that multitude died in the wilderness. The Lord teaches, saying, 'I am the bread of life: your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead. This is the bread which came down from heaven, that a man should eat thereof, and not die. '</p>

<p>6. Now <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men hunger for bread like this, for effeminate <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> will hunger; but the righteous alone, being prepared, shall be satisfied, saying, 'I shall behold Your face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> is seen by me. ' For he who partakes of divine bread always hungers with desire; and he who thus hungers has a never-failing gift, as Wisdom promises, saying, 'The Lord will not slay the righteous <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with famine.' He promises too in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, 'I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.' We may also hear our Saviour saying, 'Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. ' Well then do the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> and those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the life which is in Christ raise themselves to a longing after this food. And one earnestly implores, saying, 'As the hart pants after the fountains of waters, so pants my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> after You, O God! My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> thirsts for the living <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when shall I come and see the face of God.' And another; 'My <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I seek You early; my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> thirsts for You; often does my flesh, in a dry and pathless land, and without water. So did I appear before You in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to see Your power and Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. '</p>

<p>7. Since these things are so, my brethren, let us mortify our members which are on the earth <span class="stiki" id="note284178"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse5">Colossians&nbsp;3:5</a></span>, and be nourished with living bread, by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to be partakers of such bread as this. For our Saviour, when He called all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to him, and said, 'If any man thirst, let him [come] to Me and drink <span class="stiki" id="note284179"><a href="../bible/joh007.htm#verse37">John&nbsp;7:37</a></span>,' immediately spoke of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> without which a man cannot receive such food; 'He that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. ' To this end He continually nourished His believing <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> with His words, and gave them life by the nearness of His divinity, but to the Canaanitish <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, because she was not yet a believer, He deigned not even a reply, although she stood greatly in need of food from Him. He did this not from scorn, far from it (for the Lord is loving to men and good, and on that account He went into the coasts of <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a> and Sidon); but because of her unbelief, and because she was of those who had not the word. And He did it righteously, my brethren; for there would have been nothing gained by her offering her supplication before believing, but by her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> she would support her petition; 'For He that comes to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, must first <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that seek Him;' and that 'without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible for a man to please Him <span class="stiki" id="note284181"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;11:6</a></span>.' This <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> teaches. Now that she was hitherto an unbeliever, one of the profane, He shows, saying, 'It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs <span class="stiki" id="note284182"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;15:26</a></span>.' She then, being convinced by the power of the word, and having changed her ways, also gained <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; for the Lord no longer spoke to her as a dog, but conversed with her as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being, saying, 'O <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, great is your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>! ' As therefore she <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, He immediately granted to her the fruit of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and said, 'Be it to you as you desire. And her daughter was healed in the self-same hour.'</p>

<p>8. For the righteous man, being nurtured in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and the observance of divine precepts, has his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> always in health. Wherefore it is commanded to 'receive to ourselves him who is weak in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284184"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;14:1</a></span>,' and to nourish him, even if he is not yet able to eat bread, but herbs, 'for he that is weak eats herbs.' For even the Corinthians were not able to partake of such bread, being yet babes, and like babes they drank milk. 'For every one that partakes of milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness ,' according to the words of that divine man. The Apostle exhorts his beloved son Timothy, in his first Epistle, 'to be nourished with the word of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the good doctrine whereto he had attained.' And in the second, 'Preserve the form of sound words which you have heard of me, in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. ' And not only here, my brethren, is this bread the food of the righteous, neither are the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> on earth alone nourished by such bread and such blood; but we also eat them in heaven, for the Lord is the food even of the exalted spirits, and the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and He is the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of all the heavenly host.  And to all He is everything, and He has pity upon all according to His loving-kindness. Already has the Lord given us <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> food , and He promises to those who continue with Him in His trials, saying, 'And I promise to you a kingdom, as My Father has promised to Me; that you shall eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284189"><a href="../bible/luk022.htm#verse29">Luke&nbsp;22:29-30</a></span>.' O what a banquet is this, my brethren, and how great is the harmony and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of those who eat at this heavenly table! For they delight themselves not with that food which is cast out, but with that which produces life everlasting. Who then shall be deemed worthy of that assembly? Who is so blessed as to be called, and accounted worthy of that divine feast? Truly, 'blessed is he who shall eat bread in Your kingdom. '</p>

<p>9. Now he who has been counted worthy of the heavenly calling, and by this calling has been sanctified, if he grow negligent in it, although washed becomes defiled: 'counting the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a profane thing, and despising the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>,' he hears the words, 'Friend, how did you come in hither, not having wedding garments?' For the banquet of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> is spotless and pure; 'for many are called, but few chosen. ' Judas to wit, though he came to the supper, because he despised it went out from the presence of the Lord, and having abandoned his Life , hanged himself. But the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who continued with the Redeemer shared in the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> of the feast. And that young man who went into a far country, and there wasted his substance, living in dissipation, if he receive a desire for this divine feast, and, coming to himself, shall say, 'How many hired servants of my father have bread to spare, while I perish here with hunger!' and shall next arise and come to his father, and confess to him, saying, 'I have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against heaven and before you, and am not worthy to be called your son; make me as one of your hired servants <span class="stiki" id="note284193"><a href="../bible/luk015.htm#verse17">Luke&nbsp;15:17</a></span>;'&mdash; when he shall thus confess, then he shall be counted worthy of more than he <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> for. For the father does not receive him as a hired servant, neither does he look upon him as a stranger, but he kisses him as a son, he brings him back to life as from the dead, and counts him worthy of the divine feast, and gives him his former and precious robe. So that, on this account, there is singing and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> in the paternal home.</p>

<p>10. For this is the work of the Father's loving-kindness and goodness, that not only should He make him alive from the dead, but that He should render His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> illustrious through the Spirit. Therefore, instead of corruption, He clothes him with an incorruptible garment; instead of hunger, He kills the fatted calf; instead of far journeys, [the Father] watched for his return, providing shoes for his feet; and, what is most wonderful, placed a divine signet-ring upon his hand; while by all these things He begot him afresh in the image of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. These are the gracious gifts of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, by which the Lord honours and nourishes those who abide with Him, and also those who return to Him and repent. For He promises, saying, 'I am the bread of life; he that comes unto Me shall not hunger, and he that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> in Me shall never thirst <span class="stiki" id="note284194"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse35">John&nbsp;6:35</a></span>.' We too shall be counted worthy of these things, if at all times we cleave to our Saviour, and if we are pure, not only in these six days of <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> , but consider the whole course of our life as a feast , and continue near and do not go far off, saying to Him, 'You have the words of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life, and whither shall we go <span class="stiki" id="note284197"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse68">John&nbsp;6:68</a></span>?' Let those of us who are far off return, confessing our iniquities, and having nothing against any man, but by the spirit mortifying the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the body. <span class="stiki" id="note284198"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;8:13</a></span> For thus, having first nourished the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> here, we shall partake with <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> at that heavenly and spiritual table; not knocking and being repulsed like those five foolish <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> <span class="stiki" id="note284199"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;25:1-12</a></span>, but entering with the Lord, like those who were wise and loved the bridegroom; and showing the dying of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> in our bodies <span class="stiki" id="note284200"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse10">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:10</a></span>, we shall receive life and the kingdom from Him.</p>

<p>11. We begin the fast of forty days on the twenty-third of Mechir (Feb. 17), and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fast of the blessed feast on the twenty-eighth of Phamenoth (March 24); and having joined to these six days after them, in <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fastings</a> and watchings, as each one is able, let us rest on the third of the month Pharmuthi (March 29), on the evening of the seventh day. Also that day which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in everything, which possesses the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, namely the Lord's day , having risen upon us on the fourth of Pharmuthi (March 30), let us afterwards keep the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> feast of Pentecost. Let us at all times worship the Father in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, through Whom to Him and with Him be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and dominion by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> for ever and ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>. All the brethren who are with me salute you: salute one another with a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a>.</p>

<p>There is no eighth or ninth, for he did not send them, for the reason before mentioned. </p>

<p>Here ends the seventh Festal Letter of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Athanasius the Patriarch.</p>
