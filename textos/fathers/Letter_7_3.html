<h1>Letter 7</h1>

<p><strong>To Chromatius, Jovinus, and Eusebius. </strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This letter (written like the preceding in 374 A.D.) is addressed by Jerome to three of his former companions in the religious life. It commends Bonosus (&sect;3), asks guidance for the writer's sister (&sect;4), and attacks the conduct of Lupicinus, Bishop of Stridon (&sect;5).</span> </p>

<p>1. Those whom mutual affection has joined together, a written page ought not to sunder. I must not, therefore, distribute my words some to one and some to another. For so strong is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that binds you together that affection unites all three of you in a bond no less close than that which naturally connects two of your number.  Indeed, if the conditions of writing would only admit of it, I should amalgamate your names and express them under a single <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>. The very letter which I have received from you challenges me in each of you to see all three, and in all three to recognize each. When the reverend Evagrius transmitted it to me in the corner of the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> which stretches between the Syrians and the Saracens, my <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> was intense. It wholly surpassed the rejoicings felt at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> when the defeat of Cann&aelig; was retrieved, and Marcellus at Nola cut to pieces the forces of Hannibal. Evagrius frequently comes to see me, and cherishes me in Christ as his own bowels.  Yet as he is separated from me by a long distance, his departure has gener  ally left me as much regret as his arrival has brought me <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</p>

<p>2. I converse with your letter, I embrace it, it talks to me; it alone of those here speaks Latin. For hereabout you must either learn a barbarous jargon or else hold your tongue. As often as the lines&mdash; traced in a well-known hand&mdash; bring back to me the faces which I hold so dear, either I am no longer here, or else you are here with me. If you will credit the sincerity of affection, I seem to see you all as I write this.</p>

<p>Now at the outset I should like to ask you one petulant question. Why is it that, when we are separated by so great an interval of land and sea, you have sent me so short a letter? Is it that I have deserved no better treatment, not having first written to you? I cannot <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that paper can have failed you while <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> continues to supply its wares. Even if a Ptolemy had closed the seas, King Attalus would still have sent you parchments from Pergamum, and so by his skins you could have made up for the want of paper. The very name parchment is derived from a historical incident of the kind which occurred generations ago.  What then? Am I to suppose the messenger to have been in haste? No matter how long a letter may be, it can be written in the course of a night. Or had you some business to attend to which prevented you from writing? No claim is prior to that of affection. Two suppositions remain, either that you felt disinclined to write or else that I did not deserve a letter. Of the two I prefer to charge you with sloth than to condemn myself as undeserving. For it is easier to mend neglect than to quicken <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>.</p>

<p>3. You tell me that Bonosus, like a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> son of the Fish, has taken to the water.  As for me who am still foul with my old stains, like the basilisk and the scorpion I haunt the dry places. <span class="stiki" id="note300096"><a href="../bible/deu008.htm#verse15">Deuteronomy&nbsp;8:15</a></span> Bonosus has his heel already on the serpent's head, while I am still as food to the same serpent which by divine appointment devours the earth. <span class="stiki" id="note300097"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse14">Genesis&nbsp;3:14</a></span> He can scale already that ladder of which the psalms of degrees  are a type; while I, still weeping on its first step, hardly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether I shall ever be able to say: <q>I will lift up my eyes unto the hills, from whence comes my help.</q>  Amid the threatening billows of the world he is sitting in the safe shelter of his island,  that is, of the church's pale, and it may be that even now, like John, he is being called to eat God's book; <span class="stiki" id="note300101"><a href="../bible/rev010.htm#verse9">Revelation&nbsp;10:9-10</a></span> while I, still lying in the sepulchre of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and bound with the chains of my iniquities, wait for the Lord's command in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>: <q>Jerome, come forth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300102"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse43">John&nbsp;11:43</a></span> But Bonosus has done more than this. Like the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <span class="stiki" id="note300103"><a href="../bible/jer013.htm#verse4">Jeremiah&nbsp;13:4-5</a></span> he has carried his girdle across the Euphrates (for all the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> strength is in the loins ), and has hidden it there in a hole of the rock. Then, afterwards finding it rent, he has sung: <q>O Lord, you have possessed my reins.  You have broken my bonds in sunder. I will offer to you the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of thanksgiving.</q>  But as for me, <a href="../cathen/10666c.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a> has brought me in chains to <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a>, to the babel that is of a distracted mind. There he has laid upon me the yoke of captivity; there inserting in my nostrils a ring of iron, <span class="stiki" id="note300107"><a href="../bible/2ki019.htm#verse28">2&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;19:28</a></span> he has commanded me to sing one of the songs of Zion. To whom I have said, <q>The Lord looses the prisoners; the Lord opens the eyes of the blind.</q>  To complete my contrast in a single sentence, while I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for mercy Bonosus looks for a crown.</p>

<p>4. My sister's conversion is the fruit of the efforts of the saintly Julian. He has planted, it is for you to water, and the Lord will give the increase. <span class="stiki" id="note300109"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:6</a></span> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> has given her to me to console me for the wound which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has inflicted on her. He has restored her from death to life. But in the words of the pagan poet, for her</p>

<blockquote><p>There is no safety that I do not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. </p></blockquote>

<p>You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> yourselves how slippery is the path of youth&mdash; a path on which I have myself fallen,  and which you are now traversing not without <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. She, as she enters upon it, must have the advice and the encouragement of all, she must be aided by frequent letters from you, my reverend brothers. And&mdash; for <q>charity endures all things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note300112"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:7</a></span> &mdash; I beg you to get from Pope  Valerian  a letter to confirm her resolution. A girl's <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, is strengthened  when she realizes that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in high place are interested in her.</p>

<p>5. The fact is that my native land is a prey to barbarism, that in it men's only God is their belly,  that they live only for the present, and that the richer a man is the holier he is held to be. Moreover, to use a well-worn proverb, the dish has a cover worthy of it; for Lupicinus is their <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>.  Like lips like lettuce, as the saying goes&mdash; the only one, as Lucilius tells us,  at which Crassus ever laughed&mdash; the reference being to a donkey eating thistles. What I mean is that an unstable pilot steers a leaking ship, and that the blind is leading the blind straight to the pit. The ruler is like the ruled.</p>

<p>6. I salute your mother and mine with the respect which, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I feel towards her. Associated with you as she is in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> life, she has the start of you, her <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> children, in that she is your mother. Her womb may thus be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called golden. With her I salute your sisters, who ought all to be welcomed wherever they go, for they have triumphed over their sex and the world, and await the Bridegroom's coming, <span class="stiki" id="note300118"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;25:4</a></span> their lamps replenished with oil. O <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> the house which is a home of a widowed Anna, of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> that are prophetesses, and of twin Samuels bred in the Temple!  Fortunate the roof which shelters the martyr-mother of the Maccabees, with her sons around her, each and all wearing the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> crown! <span class="stiki" id="note300120"><a href="../bible/2ma007.htm">2&nbsp;Maccabbees&nbsp;vii</a></span> For although you confess Christ every day by keeping His commandments, yet to this private <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> you have added the public one of an open confession; for it was through you that the poison of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was formerly banished from your city.</p>

<p>You are surprised perhaps at my thus making a fresh beginning quite at the close of my letter. But what am I to do? I cannot refuse expression to my feelings. The brief limits of a letter compel me to be silent; my affection for you urges me to speak. I write in haste, my language is confused and ill-arranged; but <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of order.</p>
