<h1>Letter 80</h1>

<p> <em>To Anatolius, Bishop of Constantinople.</em></p>

<h2>I. He rejoices at Anatolius having proved himself orthodox.</h2>

<p>Leo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to Anatolius, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>.</p>

<p>We <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the Lord and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> in the gift of His Grace, Who has shown you a follower of Gospel-teaching as we have found from your letter, beloved, and our brothers' account whom we sent to Constantinople: for now through the approved <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, we are justifying in presuming that the whole church committed to him will have no wrinkle nor spot of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, as says the Apostle, <q>for I have espoused you to one husband to present you a pure virgin to Christ <span class="stiki" id="note360411"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse2">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:2</a></span> .</q> For that virgin is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the spouse of one husband Christ, who suffers herself to be corrupted by no <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, so that through the whole world we have one entire and pure communion in which we now welcome you as a fellow, beloved, and give our approval to the order of proceedings which we have received, ratified, as was proper, with the necessary signatures. In order, therefore, that your spirit in turn, beloved, might be strengthened by words of ours, we sent back after the <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> festival with our letters, our sons, Casterius, the Presbyter, and Patricius and Asclepias, the Deacons, who brought your writings to us, informing you, as we said above, that we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> at the peace of the church of Constantinople, on which we have ever spent such care that we wish it to be polluted by no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> deceit.</p>

<h2>II. The penitents among the backsliding bishops are to be received back into full communion upon some plan to be settled by Anatolius and Leo's delegates.</h2>

<p>But concerning the brethren whom we learn from your letters, and from our delegates' account, to be desirous of communion with us, on the ground of their sorrow that they did not remain constant against <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> and intimidation, but gave their assent to another's crime when terror had so bewildered them, that with hasty acquiescence they ministered to the condemnation of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> and guiltless <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> (Flavian), and to the acceptance of the detestable <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> (of Eutyches), we approve of that which was determined upon in the presence and with the co-operation of our delegates, viz., that they should be content meanwhile with the communion of their own churches, but we wish our delegates whom we have sent to consult with you, and come to some arrangement whereby those who condemn their ill-doings with full assurances of penitence, and choose rather to accuse than to defend themselves, may be gladdened by being at peace and in communion with us; on condition that what has been received against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith is first condemned with complete <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathema</a>. For otherwise in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, which is Christ's Body, there are neither valid priesthoods nor <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, unless in the reality of our nature the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> High Priest makes atonement for us, and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Blood of the spotless Lamb makes us clean. For although He be set on the Father's right hand, yet in the same flesh which He took from the Virgin, he carries on the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of propitiation, as says the Apostle, <q>Christ Jesus Who died, yea, Who also rose, Who is on the right hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who also makes intercession for us <span class="stiki" id="note360412"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse34">Romans&nbsp;8:34</a></span> .</q> For our kindness cannot be blamed in any case where we receive those who give assurance of penitence, and at whose deception we were grieved. The boon of communion with us, therefore, must neither harshly be withheld nor rashly granted, because as it is fully consistent with our religion to treat the oppressed with a Christlike charity, so it is fair to lay the full blame upon the authors of the disturbance.</p>

<h2>III. The Names of Dioscorus, Juvenal, and Eustathius are not to be read aloud at the holy altar.</h2>

<p>Concerning the reading out of the names of Dioscorus, Juvenal, and Eustathius  at the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar, it beseems you, beloved, to observe that which our friends who were there present said ought to be done, and which is consistent with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> memory of S. Flavian, and will not turn the minds of the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> away from you. For it is very wrong and unbecoming that those who have harassed innocent <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with their attacks, should be mingled indiscriminately with the names of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, seeing that by not forsaking their condemned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, they condemn themselves by their perversity: such men should either be chastised for their unfaithfulness; or strive hard after forgiveness.</p>

<h2>IV. One or two instructions about individuals.</h2>

<p>But our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, Julian, and the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who adhered to Flavian of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory, rendering him faithful service, we wish to adhere to you also beloved, that they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him who we are sure lives by the merits of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with our God to be present with them in you. We wish you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this too, beloved, that our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Eusebius , who for the Faith's sake endured many dangers and toils, is at present staying with us and continuing in our communion; whose church we would that your care should protect, that nothing may be destroyed in his absence, and no one may venture to injure him in anything until he come to you bearing a letter from us. And that our or rather all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people's affection for you may be stirred up in greater measure, we wish this that we have written to you, beloved, to come to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, that they who serve our God may give thanks for the consummation of the peace of the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a> with you. But on other matters and <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> you will be more fully instructed, beloved, by the letter you will have received through our delegates. Dated 13 April, in the consulship of the illustrious Adelfius (451).</p>
