<h1>Letter 81</h1>

<p> <em>To the Consul Nomus.</em> </p>

<p>For but a brief portion of a day I enjoyed the society of your lordship, for I was deprived by unavoidable circumstances of what I so earnestly desired. I had hoped that our short interview would have kindled good will and friendly intercourse, but I was disappointed. I have now written you two letters, without receiving any reply; and by the imperial decree I am forbidden to travel beyond the boundaries of Cyrus. For this apparent punishment <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> there is none, except the fact of my convening an episcopal synod. No indictment was published; no prosecutor appeared; the defendant was not convicted; but the sentence was given. We submit, for we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the reward of the wronged. I am aware however that Festus the Procurator who was entrusted with the government of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> when they demanded the death of the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, publicly replied, <q>It is not lawful to us Romans to deliver any man before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.</q>  Now these words were spoken by one who was no believer in our Master, Christ, but was a slave to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a>. I was never asked whether I was assembling synods or not, or for what reason I was assembling them, or what umbrage this could give, either to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> or to the government; yet just as though I had been a very guilty criminal I am prohibited from visiting other cities; while to every one else every city lies open, and that not only to <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> and Eunomians, but to Manichees and <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionists</a>, to them that are sick with the unsoundness of <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a> and <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a>, aye to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">pagans</a> and <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, while I, a foremost champion of the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a>, am from every city excluded. Some however maintain that I do not adhere to it. Then let there be a council: let there be assembled there the godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who are capable of judging: then let there be assembled those in office and in rank who have been instructed in divine lore. Let me state what I hold, and let the judges declare what opinion is agreeable to the teaching of the Apostles. I have not thus written from any desire to see the great city, nor from trying to travel to any other. In fact I rather <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the quiet of them whose wish is to administer the churches in a monastic state. I should like your excellency to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that neither in the time of the blessed and sainted Theodotus, nor in that of John of blessed memory, nor in that of the very <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> lord <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Domnus, did I of my own accord enter <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; five or six times I was invited but I with difficulty assented, and when I did assent it was in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the canon of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which orders him who is summoned to a synod and refuses to be present to be held guilty. And when I appeared, what thing unpleasing to God did I do? Was it that I removed from the sacred lists the names of such and such a man guilty of unspeakable <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>? Was it that I ordained to the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> men of character and of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> life? Was it that I preached the gospel to the people? If these things are worthy of indictment and punishment, I gladly welcome yet severer punishments for their sake. My accusers compel me to speak. Even before my conception my <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> promised to devote me to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; from my swaddling-band, they devoted me according to their promise and <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> me accordingly; the time before my <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> I spent in a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> and then was unwillingly <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>  <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Five and twenty years I so lived that I was never summoned to trial by any one nor ever brought accusation against any. Not one of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> who were under me ever frequented a court. In so many years I never took an obol nor a garment from any one. Not one of my domestics ever received a loaf or an egg. I could not endure the thought of possessing anything save the rags I wore. From the revenues of my see I erected public porticoes; I built two large bridges; I looked after the public baths. On finding that the city was not watered by the river running by it, I built the conduit, and supplied the dry town with water. But not to mention these matters I led eight villages of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcionists</a> with their neighbourhood into the way of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; another full of Eunomians and another of <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a> I brought to the light of divine <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and, by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, not a tare of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> was left among us. All this I did not effect with impunity; many a time I shed my blood; many a time was I <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a> by them and brought to the very gates of death. But I am a fool in my boasting, yet my words are spoken of necessity, not of consent. Once the thrice <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> was compelled to act in the same way to stop the mouths of his accusers. Yet I put up with seeming ignominy and count it high <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, for I hear the voice of the Apostle crying, <q>All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>.</q> </p>

<p>But I beseech your excellency to give heed to the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and calm the storm that has arisen, for in fact not even at the beginning of the dispute was the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> beset by such confusion. No one informs you of the greatness of the peril, of the lamentations of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in <a href="../cathen/12041a.htm">Ph&oelig;nicia</a> and of the wails of our holiest <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>. Wherefore I have written to you at some length, that on learning the agitation of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> your excellency might stay it, and reap the fruits of the benefit which such action will produce.</p>
