<h1>Letter 82</h1>

<p> <em>To Eusebius, Bishop of Ancyra.</em> </p>

<p>I had hoped at this time to hear frequently from your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Suffering as I do under charges which are plain <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> I stand in need of brotherly consolation. For they who are now renewing the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>, <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, Manes, and of the other Docet&aelig;, annoyed at my publicly pillorying their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, have endeavoured to deceive the imperial ears, by calling me a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> accusing me of dividing into two sons our one <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, the divine Word made man. Their utterances did not meet with the success that they expected. A dispatch was therefore written to the right <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> commander and consul, containing indeed no accusation of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but certain other charges no less unfounded. They alleged that I was endeavouring to assemble frequent synods at <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>; that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> thereupon took umbrage; that for this reason I ought to desist from these proceedings and manage the churches entrusted to my charge. When this communication was shown me I caught at the sentence as an opportunity of good. For in the first place I gained the rest I so much longed for; furthermore I trust in the wiping out of the stains of the many <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> I have committed, on account of the wrong devised against me by the enemies of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Even in this present life our supreme Ruler very plainly shows us what care He takes of them that suffer wrong. While I have been remaining at rest, prisoned within the boundaries of my own country; while throughout the East all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have been distressed and have been bitterly lamenting though compelled to silence by the terror that has fallen on them (for what has befallen me has stricken terror into the hearts of all) the Lord has stooped from heaven, has convicted my <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> of their <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, and laid bare their impious intent. They armed even Alexandria against me and by means of their worthy instruments are dinning into all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> ears that I am preaching two sons instead of one.</p>

<p>I, on the contrary, am so far from holding this abominable opinion, that, on finding some of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers of the Nicene Council opposing in their treatises the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> and forced in their struggle against their opponents to make too marked a distinction, I have objected, and refused to admit such distinction, for I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the exigencies of the distinction result in exaggeration.</p>

<p>And lest any one should suppose that I am speaking as I do through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, let any one who likes get hold of my ancient writings written before the Council of Ephesus, and those written after it twelve years ago. For by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> I interpreted all the Prophets and the Psalms and the Apostles: I wrote long ago against the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arians</a>, the Macedonians, the sophistry of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarius</a> and the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>: and in every one of my books by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> the mind of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shines clear. Moreover I have written a book on the Mysteries, another on Providence, another on the Questions of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, a life of the Saints, and besides these, not to name every one in detail, many more. </p>

<p>I have enumerated them not for ambition's sake, but to challenge my accusers and my judges to put any of my writings they may choose to the test. They will find that by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> I hold no other opinion than just that which I have received from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture.</p>

<p>When, then, your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has heard this from me, I beg you to inform the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> and to persuade the unbridled tongues that revile me and all who are deceived by them, not to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what they have heard of me from my <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>. Beg them to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> rather the Lawgiver when he exclaims <q>Men shall not receive a false report.</q>  Ask them to wait till the facts are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is that the churches may enjoy a calm and that this long and painful storm may vanish away. But if the multitude of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> suffer not this to come to pass; if for their sakes we are delivered to the sifter; we <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that we may share the perils undergone for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, in order that since we have not the confidence that comes from this life, at least for guarding the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in its integrity we may meet with pity and pardon in the day of the appearance of the Lord. And for this we beseech your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to join us in our <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>.</p>
