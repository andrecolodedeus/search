<h1>Letter 82</h1>

<p> <em>To Marcian Augustus.</em></p>

<h2>I. After congratulating the Emperor on his noble conduct, he deprecates random inquiries into the tenets of the Faith.</h2>

<p>Although I have replied  already to your Grace by the hand of the Constantinopolitan <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>, yet on receiving your clemency's mercy through the illustrious prefect of the city, my son <a href="../cathen/14464b.htm">Tatian</a>, I found still greater <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for congratulation, because I have learned your strong eagerness for the Church's peace. And this <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> desire as in fairness it deserves, secures for your empire the same <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> condition as you seek for religion. For when the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> establishes harmony among <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> princes, a twofold confidence is produced throughout the world, because the progress of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> makes the power of their arms in both directions unconquerable, so that God being propitiated by one confession, the falseness of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and the enmity of barbarians are simultaneously overthrown, most <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Emperor. The hope, therefore, of heavenly aid being increased through the Emperor's friendship, I venture with the greater confidence to appeal to your Grace on behalf of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not to allow any one in vain and presumptuous craftiness to inquire what must be held, as if it were uncertain. And although we may not in a single word dissent from the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospels</a> and Apostles, nor entertain any opinion on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Divine Scriptures</a> different to what the blessed Apostles and our Fathers learned and taught, now in these latter days unlearned and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> inquiries are set on foot, which of old the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> crushed by the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the Truth, so soon as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> aroused them in hearts which were suited to his purpose.</p>

<h2>II. The points to be settled are only which of the lapsed shall be restored, and on what terms.</h2>

<p>But it is most inopportune that through the foolishness of a few we should be brought once more into hazardous opinions, and to the warfare of carnal disputes, as if the wrangle was to be revived, and we had to settle whether Eutyches held <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> views, and whether Dioscorus gave wrong judgment, who in condemning Flavian of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory struck his own death-blow, and involved the simpler folk in the same destruction. And now that many, as we have ascertained, have betaken themselves to the means of amendment, and entreat forgiveness for their weak hastiness, we have to determine not the character of the Faith, but whose <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> we shall receive, and on what terms. And hence that most religious anxiety which you deign to feel for the proclamation of a Synod, shall have fully and timely put before it all that I judge pertinent to the needs of the case, by means of the deputies who will with all speed, if God permit, reach your Grace. Dated the 23rd of April in the consulship of the illustrious Adelfius (451).</p>
