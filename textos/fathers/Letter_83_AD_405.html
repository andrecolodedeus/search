<h1>Letter 83 (A.D. 405)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Lord Alypius Most Blessed, My Brother and Colleague, Beloved and Longed for</em>  <em>With Sincere Veneration, and to the Brethren that are with Him, Augustine and the Brethren with Him Send Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. The sorrow of the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at Thiave prevents my heart from having any rest until I hear that they have been brought again to be of the same mind towards you as they formerly were; which must be accomplished without delay. For if the apostle was concerned about one individual, <q>lest perhaps such an one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow,</q> adding in the same context the words, <q>lest <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> should get an advantage of us, for we are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of his devices,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112074"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse7">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:7,&nbsp;11</a></span> how much more does it become us to act with caution, lest we <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> similar grief to a whole flock, and especially one composed of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have lately been reconciled to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and whom I can upon no account forsake! As, however, the short time at our disposal did not permit us so to take counsel together as to arrive at a mature and satisfactory decision, may it please your Holiness to accept in this letter the finding which commended itself most to me when I had long reflected upon the matter since we parted; and if you approve of it, let the enclosed letter,  which I have written to them in the name of both of us, be sent to them without delay.</p>

<p>2. You proposed that they should have the one half [of the property left by Honoratus], and that the other half should be made up to them by me from such resources as might be at my disposal. I think, however, that if the whole property had been taken from them, men might reasonably have said that we had taken the great pains in this matter which we have done, for the sake of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, not for pecuniary advantage. But when we concede to them one half, and in that way settle with them by a compromise, it will be manifest that our anxiety has been only about the money; and you see what harm must follow from this. For, on the one hand, we shall be regarded by them as having taken away one half of a property to which we had no claim; and, on the other hand, they will be regarded by us as dishonourably and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> consenting to accept aid from one half of a property of which the whole belonged to the poor. For your remark, <q>We must beware lest, in our efforts to obtain a right adjustment of a difficult question, we <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> more serious wounds,</q> applies with no less force if the half be conceded to them. For those whose turning from the world to monastic life we desire to secure, will, for the sake of this half of their private estates, be disposed to find some excuse for putting off the sale of these, in order that their case may be dealt with according to this precedent. Moreover, would it not be strange, if, in a question like this, where much may be said on both sides, a whole community should, through our not avoiding the appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, be offended by the impression that their <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whom they hold in high esteem, are smitten with sordid <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>?</p>

<p>3. For when any one is turned to adopt the life of a <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a>, if he is adopting it with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart, he does not think of that which I have just mentioned, especially if he be admonished of the sinfulness of such conduct. But if he be a deceiver, and is seeking <q>his own things, not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112076"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;2:21</a></span> he has not charity; and without this, what does it profit him, <q>though he bestow all his goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and though he give his body to be burned</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note112077"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> Moreover, as we agreed when conversing together, this may be henceforth avoided, and an arrangement made with each individual who is disposed to enter a <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>, if he cannot be admitted to the society of the brethren before he has relieved himself of all these encumbrances, and comes as one at leisure from all business, because the property which belonged to him has ceased to be his. But there is no other way in which this spiritual death of weak brethren, and grievous obstacle to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those for whose reconciliation with the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> we so earnestly labour, can be avoided, than by our giving them most clearly to understand that we are by no means anxious about money in such cases as this. And this they cannot be made to understand, unless we leave to their use the estate which they always supposed to belong to their late <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>; because, even if it was not his, they ought to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> this from the beginning.</p>

<p>4. It seems to me, therefore, that in matters of this kind, the rule which ought to hold is, that whatever belonged, according to the ordinary civil <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> regarding property, to him who is an ordained <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergyman</a> in any place, belongs after his death to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> over which he was ordained. Now, by civil law, the property in question belonged to the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Honoratus; so that not only on account of his being ordained elsewhere, but even had he remained in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> of Thagaste, if he had died without having either sold his estate or handed it over by express deed of gift to any one, the right of succession to it would belong only to his heirs: as brother &AElig;milianus inherited those thirty shillings  left by the brother Privatus. This, therefore, behooved to be considered and provided for in time; but if no provision was made for it, we must, in the disposal of the estate, comply with the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which have been appointed to regulate in civil society the holding or not holding of property; that we may, so far as is in our power, abstain not only from the reality, but also from all appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and preserve that good name which is so necessary to our office as stewards. How <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> this procedure has the appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I beseech your wisdom to observe. For having heard of their sorrow, which we ourselves witnessed at Thiave, fearing lest, as frequently happens, I should myself be mistaken through partiality for my own opinion, I stated the facts of the case to our brother and colleague Samsucius, without telling him at the time my present view of the matter, but rather stating the view taken up by both of us when we were resisting their demands. He was exceedingly shocked, and wondered that we had entertained such a view; being moved by nothing else but the ugly appearance of the transaction, as one wholly unworthy not only of us, but of any man.</p>

<p>5. Wherefore I implore you to subscribe and transmit without delay the letter which I have written to them in name of both of us. And even if, perchance, you discern the other course to be a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> one in the matter, let not these brethren who are weak be compelled to learn now what I myself cannot understand; rather let this word of the Lord be remembered in dealing with them: <q>I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112079"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse12">John&nbsp;16:12</a></span> For He Himself, out of condescension to such weakness, said on another occasion (it was in reference to the payment of tribute), <q>Then are the children free; notwithstanding lest we offend them,</q> etc.; and sent Peter to pay the didrachm&aelig; which were then exacted. <span class="stiki" id="note112080"><a href="../bible/mat017.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;17:26-27</a></span> For He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> another law according to which he was not bound to make any such payment; but He made the payment which was imposed upon Him by that law according to which, as I have said, succession to the estate of Honoratus behooved to be regulated, if he died before either giving away or selling his property. Nay, even in regard to the law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> showed forbearance towards the weak, and did not insist upon his receiving the money due to him, although fully persuaded in his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> that he might with perfect <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> insist upon it; waiving his claim, however, only because he thereby avoided a suspicion of his motives which would mar the sweet savour of Christ among them, and abstained from the appearance of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in a region in which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that this was his duty, and probably even before he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by experience the sorrow which it would occasion. Let us now, though we are somewhat behind-hand, and have been admonished by experience, correct that which we ought to have foreseen.</p>

<p>6. I remember that you proposed when we parted that the brethren at Thagaste should hold me responsible to make up the half of the sum claimed; let me say in conclusion, that as I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> everything which may make my attempt unsuccessful, if you clearly perceive that proposal to be a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> one, I do not refuse to comply with it on this condition, however, that I am to pay the amount only when I have it in my power, <em>i.e.</em> when something so considerable falls to our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> at Hippo that this can be done without unduly straitening us&mdash;the amount remaining after the subtraction of so large a sum being still such as to provide for our <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> here an equal share in proportion to the number of resident brethren.</p>
