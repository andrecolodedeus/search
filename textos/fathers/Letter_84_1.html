<h1>Letter 84</h1>

<p><strong>To Pammachius and Oceanus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">A calm letter in which Jerome defines and justifies his own attitude towards <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, but unduly minimizes his early enthusiasm for him. He admires him in the same way that Cyprian admired <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> but does not in any way adopt his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. He then describes his own studies and recounts his <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obligations</a> to <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>, Didymus, and a Jew named Bar-anina. The rest of the letter deals with the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, the state of the text of his writings, and the eulogy of him composed by the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Pamphilus (the authenticity of which Jerome assails without any sufficient reason). The date of the letter is 400 A.D.</span> </p>

<p">Jerome to the brothers Pammachius and Oceanus, with all good wishes.</p>

<p>1. The sheets that you send me  cover me at once with compliments and confusion; for, while they praise my ability, they take away my sincerity in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But as both at Alexandria and at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> and, I may say, throughout the whole world good men have made it a habit to take the same liberties with my name, esteeming me only so far that they cannot bear to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> without having me of the number, I will leave aside personalities and only answer specific charges. For it is of no benefit to a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to encounter railing with railing and to retaliate for attacks upon oneself by attacks upon one's opponents. We are commanded not to return <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <span class="stiki" id="note302549"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:15</a></span> but to overcome <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with good, <span class="stiki" id="note302550"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;12:21</a></span> to take our fill of insults, and to turn the other cheek to the smiter. <span class="stiki" id="note302551"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse39">Matthew&nbsp;5:39</a></span> </p>

<p>2. It is charged against me that I have sometimes praised <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. If I am not mistaken I have only done so in two places, in the short preface (addressed to Damasus) to his homilies on the Song of Songs and in the prologue to my book of Hebrew Names. In these passages do the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the church come into question? Is anything said of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>? Or of the resurrection of the flesh? Or of the condition and material of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? I have merely praised the simplicity of his rendering and commentary and neither the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> nor the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> come in at all. Ethics only are dealt with and the mist of allegory is dispelled by a clear explanation. I have praised the commentator but not the theologian, the man of <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> but not the believer, the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> but not the apostle. But if men wish to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> my real judgement upon <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; let them read my commentaries upon Ecclesiastes, let them go through my three books upon the epistle to the Ephesians: they will then see that I have always opposed his doctrines. How foolish it would be to eulogize a system so far as to endorse its <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>! The blessed Cyprian takes <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> for his master, as his writings prove; yet, delighted as he is with the ability of this learned and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> writer he does not join him in following <a href="../cathen/10521a.htm">Montanus</a> and Maximilla.  <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> is the author of a most weighty book against Porphyry, and Eusebius has composed a fine history of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; yet of these the former has mutilated Christ's incarnate humanity,  while the latter is the most open champion of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> impiety.  <q>Woe,</q> says Isaiah, <q>unto them that call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> good and good <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302555"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;5:20</a></span> We must not detract from the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of our opponents&mdash; if they have any praiseworthy qualities&mdash; but neither must we praise the defects of our friends. Each several case must be judged on its own merits and not by a reference to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> concerned. While Lucilius is rightly assailed by Horace  for the unevenness of his verses, he is equally rightly praised for his wit and his charming style.</p>

<p>3. In my younger days I was carried away with a great passion for learning, yet I was not like some presumptuous enough to teach myself. At <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a> I frequently listened to <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> of <a href="../cathen/08794a.htm">Laodicea</a>, and attended his lectures; yet, although he instructed me in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> scriptures, I never embraced his disputable doctrine as to their meaning. At length my head became sprinkled with gray hairs so that I looked more like a master than a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>. Yet I went on to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> and heard Didymus.  And I have much to thank him for: for what I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> I learned from him, and what I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> already I did not forget. So excellent was his teaching. Men fancied that I had now made an end of learning. Yet once more I came to Jerusalem and to <a href="../cathen/02533a.htm">Bethlehem</a>. What trouble and expense it cost me to get Baraninas  to teach me under cover of night. For by his <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> he presented to me in his own person a second edition of <a href="../cathen/11066b.htm">Nicodemus</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302559"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;3:2</a></span> Of all of these I have frequently made mention in my works. The doctrines of <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a> and of Didymus are mutually contradictory. The squadrons of the two leaders must drag me in different directions, for I acknowledge both as my masters. If it is expedient to <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> any men and to loath any race, I have a strange dislike to those of the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>. For up to the present day they <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> in the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note302560"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse9">Revelation&nbsp;2:9</a></span> Yet can anyone find fault with me for having had a Jew as a teacher? Does a certain person dare to bring forward against me the letter I wrote to Didymus calling him my master? It is a great crime, it would seem, for me a <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> to give to one both old and learned the name of master. And yet when I ask leave to look at the letter which has been held over so long to discredit me at last, there is nothing in it but courteous language and a few words of greeting. Such charges are both foolish and frivolous. It would be more to the point to exhibit a passage in which I have defended <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or praised some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">wicked doctrine</a> of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. In the portion of Isaiah which describes the crying of the two seraphim <span class="stiki" id="note302561"><a href="../bible/isa006.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;6:2</a></span> he explains these to be the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>; but have not I altered this hateful explanation into a reference to the two testaments?  I have the book in my hand as it was published twenty years ago. In numbers of my works and especially in my commentaries I have, as occasion has offered, mangled this <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> school. And if my opponents allege that I have done more than anyone else to form a collection of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> books, I answer that I only wish I could have the works of all theological writers that by diligent study of them, I might make up for the slowness of my own wits. I have made a collection of his books, I admit; but because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> everything that he has written I do not follow his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. I speak as a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>: <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> one who has tried him. His doctrines are poisonous, they are unknown to the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>, nay more, they do them <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. I have read <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, I repeat, I have read him; and if it is a crime to read him, I admit my guilt: indeed, these <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> writings have emptied my purse. If you will <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, I have never been an Origenist: if you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me, I have now ceased to be one. But if even this fails to convince you, you will compel me in self-defence to write against your favourite, so that, if you will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me when I disclaim him, you will have to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me when I attack him. But I find readier credence when I go wrong than when I show amendment. And this is not surprising, for my would-be friends suppose me a fellow <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a> with them in the arcana of their system. I am loath, they fancy, to profess esoteric doctrines before <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who according to them are brute-like and made of clay. For it is an axiom with them that pearls ought not to be lightly cast before swine, nor that which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> given to the dogs. <span class="stiki" id="note302563"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> They agree with David when he says: <q>Your word have I hid in mine heart that I might not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against you;</q>  and when in another place he describes the righteous man as one <q>who speaks <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> with his neighbour,</q>  that is with those who <q>are of the household of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302566"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse10">Galatians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> From these passages they conclude that those of us who as yet are uninitiated ought to be told falsehoods, lest, being still unweaned babes, we should be choked by too solid food. Now that <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjury</a> and lying enter into their <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and form a bond between them appears most clearly from the sixth book of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> Miscellanies,  in which he harmonizes the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> doctrine  with the conceptions of <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a>.</p>

<p>4. What must I do then? Deny that I am of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> opinion? They will not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> me. Swear that I am not? They will laugh and say that I deal in lies. I will do the one thing which they dread. I will bring forward their sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, and will expose the cunning whereby they delude simple folk like myself. Perhaps, although they refuse credence to my voice when I deny, they may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> my pen when I accuse. Of one thing they are particularly apprehensive, and that is that their writings may some day be taken as evidence against their master. They are ready to make statements on <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> and to disclaim them afterwards with an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> as false as the first. When asked for their signatures they use shifts and seek excuses. One says: <q>I cannot condemn what no one else has condemned.</q> Another says: <q>No decision was arrived at on the point by the Fathers.</q>  It is thus that they appeal to the judgment of the world to put off the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of assenting to a condemnation. Another says with yet more assurance: <q>how am I to condemn men whom the council of Nic&aelig;a has left untouched? For the council which condemned <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a> would surely have condemned <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> too, had it disapproved of his doctrines.</q> They were bound in other words to cure all the diseases of the church at once and with one remedy; and by parity of reasoning we must deny the majesty of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> because nothing was said of his nature in that council. But the question was of <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, not of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, not of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. The <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at the council proclaimed their adherence to a dogma which was at the time denied; they said nothing about a difficulty which no one had raised. And yet they covertly struck at <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> as the source of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: for, in condemning those who deny the Son to be of the substance of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, they have condemned <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> as much as <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>. On the ground taken by these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> we have no right to condemn Valentine,  <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>,  or the Cataphrygians,  or Manich&aelig;us, none of whom are named by the council of Nic&aelig;a, and yet there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that in time they were prior to it. But when they find themselves pressed either to subscribe or to leave the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, you may see some strange twisting. They qualify their words, they arrange them anew, they use vague expressions; so as, if possible, to hold both our confession and that of our opponents, to be called indifferently <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. As if it were not in the same spirit that the Delphian Apollo (or, as he is sometimes called, Loxias) gave his oracles to Cr&oelig;sus and to Pyrrhus; cheating with a similar device two men widely separated in time.  To make my meaning clear I will give a few examples.</p>

<p>5. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, say they, in the resurrection of the body. This confession, if only it be sincere, is free from objection. But as there are bodies celestial and bodies terrestrial <span class="stiki" id="note302574"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse40">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:40</a></span> and as thin air and the &aelig;ther are both according to their natures called bodies, they use the word body instead of the word flesh in order that an <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> person hearing them say body may take them to mean flesh while a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> will understand that they mean spirit. This is their first piece of craft, and if this is found out, they devise fresh wiles, and, pretending innocence themselves, accuse us of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>. As though they were frank <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> they say, <q>We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the resurrection of the flesh.</q> Now when they have said this, the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> crowd thinks it ought to be satisfied, particularly because these exact words are found in the creed.  If you go on to question them farther, a buzz of disapproval is heard in the ring and their backers cry out: <q>You have heard them say that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the resurrection of the flesh; what more do you want?</q> the popular favour is transferred from our side to theirs, and while they are called honest, we are looked on as false accusers. But if you set your face steadily and keeping a firm hold of their admission about the flesh, proceed to press them as to whether they assert the resurrection of that flesh which is visible and tangible, which walks and speaks, they first laugh and then signify their assent. And when we inquire whether the resurrection will exhibit anew the hair and the teeth, the chest and the stomach, the hands and the feet, and all the other members of the body, then no longer able to contain their mirth they burst out laughing and tell us that in that case we shall need barbers, and cakes, and doctors, and cobblers. Do we, they ask us in turn, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that after the resurrection men's cheeks will still be rough and those of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> smooth, and that sex will differentiate their bodies as it does at present? Then if we admit this, they at once deduce from our admission conclusions involving the grossest materialism. Thus, while they maintain the resurrection of the body as a whole, they deny the resurrection of its separate members.</p>

<p>6. The present is not a time to speak rhetorically against a perverse doctrine. Neither the rich vocabulary of Cicero nor the fervid eloquence of Demosthenes could adequately convey the warmth of my feeling, were I to attempt to expose the quibbles by which these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, while verbally professing a belief in the resurrection, in their hearts deny it. For their <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> finger their breasts, slap their chests, pinch their legs and arms, and say, <q>What will a resurrection profit us if these frail bodies are to rise again? No, if we are to be like <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302576"><a href="../bible/mat022.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;22:30</a></span> we shall have the bodies of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.</q> That is to say they scorn to rise again with the flesh and bones wherewith even Christ rose. <span class="stiki" id="note302577"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse39">Luke&nbsp;24:39</a></span> Now suppose for a moment that in my youth I went astray and that, trained as I was in the schools of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, I was <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, in the beginning of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of the <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and fancied that what I had read in Pythagoras and <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> and Empedocles was also contained in the writings of the apostle: Supposing, I say, that I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> all this, why do you yet follow the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of a mere babe and sucking child in Christ? Why do you learn irreligion of one who as yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not religion? After shipwreck one has still a plank to cling to;  and one may atone for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> by a frank confession. You have followed me when I have gone astray; follow me also now that I have been brought back. In youth we have wandered; now that we are old let us mend our ways. Let us unite our tears and our groans; let us weep together, and return to the Lord our Maker.  Let us not wait for the repentance of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>; for this is a vain anticipation and one that will drag us into the deep of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a>. Life must be sought or lost here. If I have never followed <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, it is in vain that you seek to discredit me: if I have been his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, imitate my penitence. You have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> my confession; credit also my denial.</p>

<p>7. But it will be said, <q>If you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> these things, why did you praise him in your works?</q> I should praise him today but that you and men like you praise his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. I should still find his talent attractive, but that some people have been attracted by his impiety. <q>Read  all things,</q> says the apostle, <q>hold fast that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302581"><a href="../bible/1th005.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> Lactantius in his books and particularly in his letters to Demetrian altogether denies the subsistence of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and following the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> says that the passages in which he is spoken of refer to the Father or to the Son and that the words '<a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirit' merely prove the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of these two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the Godhead. But who can forbid me to read his <em>Institutes</em>&mdash; in which he has written against the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> with much ability&mdash; simply because this opinion of his is to be abhorred? <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinaris</a>  has written excellent treatises against Porphyry, and I approve of his labours, although I despise his doctrine in many points because of its foolishness. If you too for your parts will but admit that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> in certain things I will not say another syllable. Acknowledge that he thought amiss concerning the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and still more amiss concerning the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, point out the impiety of which he has been guilty in speaking of men's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> as having fallen from heaven, and show that, while in word he asserts the resurrection of the flesh, he destroys the force of this language by other assertions. As, for instance, that, after many ages and one <q>restitution of all things,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302583"><a href="../bible/act003.htm#verse21">Acts&nbsp;3:21</a></span> it will be the same for Gabriel as for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, for <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> as for <a href="../cathen/03143b.htm">Caiaphas</a>, for <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> as for prostitutes. When once you have rejected these misstatements and have parted them with your censor's wand from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, I may read what is left with safety, and having first taken the antidote need no longer dread the poison. For instance it will do me no harm to say as I have said, <q>Whereas in his other books <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> has surpassed all other writers, in commenting on the Song of Songs he has surpassed himself</q>; nor will I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to face the words with which formerly in my younger days I spoke of him as a doctor of the churches.  Will it be pretended, that I was bound to accuse a man whose works I was translating by special request? That I was bound to say in my preface, <q>This writer whose books I translate is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>: beware of him, reader, read him not, flee from the viper: or, if you are bent on reading him, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the treatises which I have translated have been garbled by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men; yet you need not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, for I have corrected all the places which they have corrupted,</q> that in other words I ought to have said: <q>the writer that I translate is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, but I, his translator, am a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>.</q> The fact is that you and your party in your anxiety to be straightforward, ingenuous, and honest, have paid too little regard to the precepts of rhetoric and to the devices of oratory. For in admitting that his books <em>On First Principles</em> are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> and in trying to lay the blame of this upon others, you raise difficulties for your readers; you induce them to examine the whole life of the author and to form a judgment on the question from the remainder of his writings. I on the other hand have been wise enough to emend silently what I wished to emend: thus by ignoring the crime I have averted prejudice from the criminal. Doctors tell us that serious maladies ought not to be subjected to treatment, but should be left to nature, lest the remedies applied should intensify the disease. It is now almost one hundred and fifty years since <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> died at <a href="../cathen/15109a.htm">Tyre</a>.  Yet what Latin writer has ever ventured to translate his books <em>On the Resurrection</em> and <em>On First Principles</em>, his <em>Miscellanies</em>  and his <em>Commentaries</em> or as he himself calls them his <em>Tomes?</em>  Who has ever cared by so <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> a work to cover himself with <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>? I am not more eloquent than Hilary or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than Victorinus who both have rendered his <em>Homilies</em> not in exact versions but in independent paraphrases. Recently also Ambrose appropriated his <em>Six Days' Work</em>,  but in such a way that it expressed the views of Hippolytus and Basil rather than of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. You profess to take me for your model, and blind as moles in relation to others you scan me with the eyes of gazelles. Well, had I been ill-disposed towards <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, I might have translated these very books so as to make his worst writings <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to Latin readers; but this I have never done; and, though many have asked me, I have always refused. For it has never been my habit to crow over the mistakes of men whose talents I admire. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> himself, were he still alive, would soon fall out with you his would-be patrons and would say with Jacob: <q>You have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302590"><a href="../bible/gen034.htm#verse30">Genesis&nbsp;34:30</a></span> </p>

<p>8. Does any one wish to praise <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>? Let him praise him as I do. From his childhood he was a great man, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> son.  At Alexandria he presided over the school of the church, succeeding a man of great learning the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Clement. So greatly did he abhor sensuality that, out of a <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for God but yet one not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302592"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;10:2</a></span> he castrated himself with a knife. Covetousness he trampled under foot. He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the scriptures by heart and laboured hard day and night to explain their meaning. He delivered in church more than a thousand sermons, and published innumerable commentaries which he called tomes. These I now pass over, for it is not my purpose to catalogue his writings. Which of us can read all that he has written? And who can fail to admire  his enthusiasm for the scriptures? If some one in the spirit of Judas the Zealot  brings up to me his mistakes, he shall have his answer in the words of Horace:</p>

<blockquote><p>'Tis <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that sometimes Homer sleeps, but then
<br>He's not without excuse:
<br>The fault is venial, for his work is long. </p></blockquote>

<p>Let us not imitate the faults of one whose <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> we cannot equal. Other men have erred concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, both Greeks and Latins, but I must not mention their names lest I should be supposed to defend <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> not by his own merits but by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of others. This, you will say, is to accuse them and not to excuse him. You would be right, if I had declared him not to have erred, or if I had professed a belief that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> or an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> from heaven <span class="stiki" id="note302595"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;1:8</a></span> ought to be listened to in a depravation of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. But as it is seeing I frankly admit him to be wrong, I may read him on the same terms as I read others, because if he is wrong so also are they. But you may say, If <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is common to many, why do you assail him alone? I answer, because he alone is praised by you as an apostle. Take away your exaggerated <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for him, and I am ready to take away the greatness of my dislike. While you gather other men's faulty statements out of their books merely to defend <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, you extol this latter to the sky and will not allow that he has erred at all. Whosoever you are who are thus preaching new doctrines, I beseech you, spare the ears of the Romans, spare the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of a church which an apostle has praised. <span class="stiki" id="note302596"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse8">Romans&nbsp;1:8</a></span> Why after four hundred years do you try to teach us Romans doctrines of which until now we have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> nothing? Why do you publicly proclaim opinions which Peter and <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>  refused to profess? Until now no such teaching has been heard of, and yet the world has become christian. For my part I will hold fast in my old age the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> wherein I was born again in my boyhood.  They speak of us as claytowners,  made out of dirt, brutish and carnal, because, say they, we refuse to receive the things of the spirit; but of course they themselves are citizens of Jerusalem and their mother is in heaven. <span class="stiki" id="note302600"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm#verse26">Galatians&nbsp;4:26</a></span> I do not despise the flesh in which Christ was born and rose again, or scorn the mud which, baked into a clean vessel, reigns in heaven. And yet I wonder why they who detract from the flesh live after the flesh,  and cherish and delicately nurture that which is their enemy. Perhaps indeed they wish to fulfil the words of scripture: <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your enemies and bless them that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you.</q>  I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the flesh, but I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> it only when it is chaste, when it is virginal, when it is mortified by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a>: I <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> not its works but itself, that flesh which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it must be judged, and therefore dies as a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which is scourged and torn asunder and burned with fire.</p>

<p>9. The folly also of their contention that certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and ill-disposed <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have tampered with <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> writings may be shown thus. Could any person be more wise, more learned, or more eloquent than were Eusebius and Didymus, <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> supporters? Of these the former in the six volumes of his <em>Apology</em> asserts that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> is of the same mind with himself; while the latter, though he tries to excuse his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, admits that he has made them. Not being able to deny what he finds written, he endeavours to explain it away. It is one thing to say that additions have been made by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but another to maintain that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> statements are commendable. <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> case would be unique if his writings were falsified all over the world and if in one day by an edict like that of Mithridates  all the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were shorn from his volumes. Even supposing that some one treatise of his has been tampered with, can it be possible that all his works, published as they were at different times and places, have been corrupted? <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> himself in a letter written to Fabian, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>,  expresses penitence for having made erroneous statements, and charges Ambrose  with over haste in making public what was meant only for private circulation. And yet to this day his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> search for shifts to prove that all that excites disapprobation in his writings is due not to him but to others.</p>

<p>10. Moreover, when they speak of Pamphilus as one who praised <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, I am personally much <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to them for accounting me worthy to be <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniated</a> with that <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. For if, sirs, you tell me that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> books have been tampered with by his enemies to bring them into discredit; why may not I in my turn allege that his friends and followers have attributed to Pamphilus a volume composed by themselves to vindicate their master from disrepute by the testimony of a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>? Lo and behold, you yourselves correct in <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> books passages which (according to you) he never wrote: and yet you are surprised if a man is said to have published a book which as a matter of fact he did not publish. But while your statements can easily be brought to the test by an appeal to <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> published works; as Pamphilus has published nothing else, it is easier for <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a> to fix a book upon him. For show me any other work of Pamphilus; you will nowhere find any, this is his only one. How then can I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is by Pamphilus? You will tell me, that the style and tone ought to inform me. Well, I shall never <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that a man so learned has dedicated the first fruits of his talent to defend doubtful and discredited positions. The very name of an apology which the treatise bears implies a previous charge made; for nothing is defended that is not first attacked. I will now bring forward but a single argument, one, however, the force of which only folly and effrontery can deny. The treatise attributed to Pamphilus contains nearly the first thousand lines of Eusebius's sixth book in defence of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>.  Yet in the remaining parts of his work the writer brings forward passages by which he seeks to prove that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> was a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. Now Eusebius and Pamphilus were in such thorough harmony with each other that they seemed to have but one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> between them, and one even went so far as to adopt the other's name.  How then could they have disagreed so fundamentally on this point, Eusebius in all his works proving <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> to be an <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a>, and Pamphilus describing him as a supporter of the Nicene council, which had not yet been held? It is evident from this consideration that the book belongs not to Pamphilus but to Didymus or somebody else, who having cut off the head of Eusebius's sixth book supplied the other members himself. But I am willing to be generous and to allow that the book is written by Pamphilus, only by Pamphilus not yet a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. For he must have written the book before he underwent <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. And why, you will say, was he accounted worthy of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>? Surely that he might efface his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> death, and wash away his one fault by shedding his blood. How many <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> there have been all the world over who before their deaths have been the slaves of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>! Are we then to palliate the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> because those who committed them have afterwards become <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>?</p>

<p>11. This reply to your letter, my most loving brothers, I have dictated in all haste; and, overcoming my scruples, I have taken up my pen against a man whose ability I once eulogized. I would sooner, indeed, risk my <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> than my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. My friends have placed me in the awkward dilemma that if I say nothing I shall be held guilty, and if I offer a defence I shall be accounted an enemy. Both alternatives are hard; but of the two I will choose that which is the least so. A quarrel can be made up, but <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> can find no forgiveness. I leave to your judgment to discover how much labour I have expended in translating the books <em>On First Principles</em>; for on the one hand if one alters anything from the Greek the work becomes less a version than a perversion; and on the other hand a literal adherence to the original by no means tends to preserve the charm of its eloquence.</p>
