<h1>Letter 85</h1>

<p> <em>To the Bishop Basil. </em></p>

<p>The chief good is said by the divine <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to be <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>,  and by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he ordered the nurslings of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to be fed. Of this <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> possesses great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, and so has told me what was befitting and given me pleasant news. For to them that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the Lord what can be pleasanter than the health and harmony of the doctrines of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Be well assured, most godly sir, that we were much delighted to hear the intelligence of our common friend; and in proportion to our previous distress at hearing that he described the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of flesh and of Godhead as one, and openly attributed the passion of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to the impassible Godhead, so were all rejoiced to read the letters of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and to learn that he maintains in their integrity the properties of the natures and denies both the change of <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> into flesh, and the mutation of the flesh into the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of Godhead, maintaining on the contrary that in the one Son, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">God the Word</a> made man, the properties of either nature abide unconfounded. We praise the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all for the harmony of divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. We have however written to either Cilicia,  although our intelligence is imperfect, as to whether there are really any opponents of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and have charged the godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to search and examine if there are any who divide the one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> into two sons, and either to bring them to their senses by admonition, or cut them off from the roll of the brethren. For in fact we equally repudiate both those who dare to assert one nature of flesh and Godhead, and those who divide the one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> into two sons and strive to go beyond the definitions of the Apostles.</p>

<p>But let your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> be well assured that we are disposed to peace. For if the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, <q>With them that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> peace I was peaceful,</q>  much more readily do we welcome the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<p>Some of those men who have been fed on lies have hurried to <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> and patched up <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against me, with the result that the godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of that city, led away by their statements, although he had been fully informed by my letters, has sent a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to the imperial city. I beg you therefore to show your accustomed kindness to him, and to confront <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>
