<h1>Letter 85</h1>

<p><strong>To Paulinus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Paulinus had asked Jerome two questions, (1) how can certain passages of scripture <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/exo007.htm#verse13">Exodus 7:13</a>; <a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans 9:16</a></span> be reconciled with Free Will? And (2) Why are the children of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> said to be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <span class="stiki"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse14">1 Corinthians 7:14</a></span> apart from baptismal <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>? For the first of these questions Jerome refers Paulinus to his version (newly made) of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> treatise, <em>On First Principles</em>. For the second he quotes the explanation of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a>. Written in 400 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. Your words urge me to write to you but your eloquence deters me from doing so. For as a letter-writer you are almost as good as Tully. You complain that my letters are short and unpolished: this is not due to carelessness but to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of you, lest writing to you at greater length I should but send you more sentences to find fault with. Moreover, to make a clean breast of it to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man like you, just about the time the vessels sail for the west, so many letters are demanded of me at once that, if I were to reply to all my correspondents, I should be unable to accomplish my task. Hence it happens that, neglecting the niceties of composition and not revising the work of my secretaries, I dictate whatever first comes into my head. Thus when I write to you I regard you as a friend and not as a critic.</p>

<p>2. Your letter propounds two questions, the first, why God hardened <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> heart, and why the apostle said: <q>So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302609"><a href="../bible/rom009.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;9:16</a></span> and other things which appear to do away with <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free will</a>: the second, how those are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> who are born of believing, that is, of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note302610"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:14</a></span> seeing that without the gift of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> afterwards received and kept they cannot be saved.</p>

<p>3. Your first question is most ably answered by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> in his treatise <em>on First Principles</em> which, at the request of my friend Pammachius, I have recently translated. This task has occupied me so fully that I am unable to keep my word with you and must again postpone the sending my commentary on Daniel. Indeed, distinguished and devoted to me as Pammachius is, had he been alone in his request, I should have deferred it to another time, but, as it was, almost all our brothers at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> urged the same demand declaring that many <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were in danger, and that some even accepted <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> teaching. I have found myself forced therefore to translate a book in which there is more of bad than of good, and to keep to this rule that I should neither add nor subtract but should preserve in Latin in its integrity the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense of the Greek. You will be able to borrow a copy of my version from the aforesaid brother, though in your case the Greek will serve quite as well; neither should you, who can drink from the fountain head, turn to the muddy streamlets supplied by my poor wits.</p>

<p>4. Moreover, as I am speaking to an <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> man, well versed both in the sacred scriptures and in secular literature, I desire to give your excellency this note of warning. Do not suppose that I am a clumsy buffoon  who condemn everything that <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> has written&mdash;as his injudicious friends <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> assert&mdash; or that I have changed my mind as suddenly as the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> Dionysius.  The fact is that I repudiate merely his objectionable <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a>. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that one curse hangs over those who call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> good and over those who call good <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, over those who put bitter for sweet, and over those who put sweet for bitter. <span class="stiki" id="note302613"><a href="../bible/isa005.htm#verse20">Isaiah&nbsp;5:20</a></span> Who would go so far in praise of another man's teaching as to acquiesce in <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>?</p>

<p>5. Your second question is discussed by <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> in his books <em>on</em> <em>Monogamy</em> where he declares that the children of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> because they are as it were candidates for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and have suffered no pollution from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Consider also that the vessels of which we read in the tabernacle are called <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and everything else required for the ceremonial worship: although in strictness of speech there can be nothing <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> except creatures which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of and worship God. But it is a scriptural usage sometimes to give the name of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to those who are clean, or who have been purified, or who have made expiation. For instance, it is written of Bathsheba that she was made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>  from her uncleanness, <span class="stiki" id="note302616"><a href="../bible/2sa011.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;11:4</a></span> and the temple itself is called the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> place.</p>

<p>6. I beg that you will not silently in your mind accuse me either of vanity or of insincerity. God bears me <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in my <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> that the unavoidable circumstances mentioned above drew me back when I was just going to grapple with my commentary; and you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that what is done when the mind is pre-occupied is never well done. I gladly accept the cap that you have sent me, a mark, though small, of no small affection and just the thing to keep an old man's head warm. I am delighted alike with the gift and with the giver.</p>
