<h1>Letter 85 (A.D. 405)</h1>

<p> <em>To My Lord Paulus, Most Beloved, My Brother and Colleague in the Priesthood, Whose Highest Welfare is Sought by All My Prayers, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. You would not call me so inexorable if you did not think me also a dissembler. For what else do you <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> concerning my spirit, if I am to judge by what you have written, than that I cherish towards you dislike and antipathy which merit blame and detestation; as if in a matter about which, there could be but one opinion I was not careful lest, while warning others, I myself should deserve reproof, <span class="stiki" id="note112082"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:27</a></span> or were wishing to cast the mote out of your eye while retaining and fostering the beam in my own? <span class="stiki" id="note112083"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse4">Matthew&nbsp;7:4</a></span> It is by no means as you suppose. Behold! I repeat this, and call God to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that if you were only to desire for yourself what I desire on your behalf, you would now be living in Christ free from all disquietude, and would make the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> brought by you to His name. Observe, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> you, that I have addressed you not only as my brother, but also as my colleague. For it cannot be that any <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whatsoever of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should cease to be my colleague, so long as he has not been condemned by any <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> tribunal. As to my refusing to hold communion with you, the only reason for this is that I cannot flatter you. For inasmuch as I have begotten you in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, I am under very special obligation to render to you the salutary severity of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in faithful admonition and reproof. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that I <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the numbers who have been, by God's blessing on your work, gathered into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but this does not make me less bound to weep that a greater number are being by you scattered from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For you have so wounded the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of Hippo,  that unless the Lord make you disengage yourself from all secular cares and burdens, and recall you to the manner of living and deportment which become the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the wound may soon be beyond remedy.</p>

<p>2. Seeing, however, that you continue to involve yourself more and more deeply in these affairs, and have, notwithstanding your vow of renunciation, entangled yourself again with the things which you had solemnly laid aside&mdash;a step which could not be justified even by the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> affairs; seeing also that you are reported to be living in a style of extravagance which cannot be maintained by the slender income of your church,&mdash; why do you insist upon communion with me, while you refuse to hear my rebuke of your faults? Is it that men whose complaints I cannot bear, may <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> blame me for whatever you do? You are, moreover, mistaken in suspecting that those who find fault with you are <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who have always been against you even in your earlier life. It is not so: and you have no reason to be surprised that many things escape your observation. But even were this the case, it is your duty to secure that they find nothing in your conduct which they might reasonably blame, and for which they might bring reproach against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Perhaps you think that my reason for saying these things is, that I have not accepted what you urged in your defence. Nay, rather my reason is, that if I were to say nothing regarding these things, I would be guilty of that for which I could urge nothing in my defence before God. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> your abilities; but even a man of dull mind is kept from disquietude if he sets his affections on heavenly things, whereas a man of acute mind has this gift in vain if he set his affections on earthly things. The office of a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is not designed to enable one to spend a life of vanity. The Lord <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who has closed against you all the ways by which you were disposed to make Him minister to your gain, in order that He may guide you, if you but understand Him, into that way, with a view to the pursuit of which that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> responsibility was laid upon you, will Himself teach you what I now say.</p>
