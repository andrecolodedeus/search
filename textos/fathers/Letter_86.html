<h1>Letter 86</h1>

<p> <em>Flavianus, Bishop of Constantinople.</em></p>

<p>At the present time, most God-beloved lord, I have received many buffetings of billows, but I called upon the great Pilot, and have been able to stand firm against the storm; the attacks, however, now made upon me transcend every story in tragedy. In relation to the attacks which are being plotted against the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, I thought that I should find an ally and fellow-worker in the most godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria, the lord Dioscorus,  and so sent him one of our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, a man of remarkable <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudence</a>, with a synodical letter informing his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that we abide in the agreement made in the time of Cyril of blessed memory, and accept the letter written by him as well as that written by the very blessed and sainted Athanasius to the blessed Epictetus, and, before these, the exposition of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> laid down at Nic&aelig;a in Bithynia by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and blessed Fathers. We exhorted him to induce those who are unwilling to abide by these documents at once to abide by them. But one of the opposite party, who keep up these disturbances, by tricking some of those who are on the spot and contriving countless <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> against myself has stirred an iniquitous agitation against me.</p>

<p>But the very godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Dioscorus has written us a letter such as never ought to have been written by one who has learned from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all not to listen to vain words. He has <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the charges brought against me as though he had made personal enquiry into every one of them, and had arrived at the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> after questioning, and has thus condemned me. I however have bravely borne the <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnious</a> charge, and have written him back a courteous letter, representing to his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> that the whole charge is false, and that not one of the godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the East holds opinions contrary to the apostolic decrees. Moreover the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> whom he sent as messengers have been convinced by the actual evidence of the facts. These however he has dismissed unheeded, and, lending his ears to my <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a>, has acted in a manner quite incredible, were it not that the whole church bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to it. He put up with them that were crying Anathema against me; nay he stood up in his place and confirmed their words by adding his voice to theirs. Besides all this he sent certain godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to the imperial city, as we learned, in the hope of increasing the agitation against me. I in the first place have for champion Him who sees all things, for it is on behalf of the divine decrees that I am wrestling&mdash; next after Him I invoke your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to fight in defence of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> that is attacked, and do battle on behalf of the canons that are being trodden under foot. When the blessed Fathers were assembled in that imperial city  in harmony with them that had sat in council at Nic&aelig;a, they distinguished the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">dioceses</a>, and assigned to each diocese the management of its own affairs, expressly enjoining that none should intrude from one diocese into another. They ordered that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Alexandria should administer the government of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> alone, and every diocese its own affairs. </p>

<p>Dioscorus, however, refuses to abide by these decisions; he is turning the see of the blessed Mark upside down; and these things he does though he perfectly well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that the Antiochene metropolis possesses the throne of the great Peter, who was teacher of the blessed Mark, and first and coryph&aelig;us of the chorus of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. </p>

<p>But I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the majesty of the see, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> and take measure of myself. I have learned from the first the humility of the Apostles. I beseech your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> not to overlook the trampling underfoot of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> canons, and to stand forward <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealously</a> as champion of the divine <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for in that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we have hope of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> and on its account are confident that we shall meet with mercy.</p>

<p>But that your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> may not be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of this, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, my lord, that he showed his ill-will towards me from the time of my assenting, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the canons of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, to the synodical letters issued in your see in the time of Proclus of blessed memory; on this point he has chidden me once and again on the ground of my violating the rights of the <a href="../cathen/01567a.htm">church of Antioch</a> and, as he says, of that of Alexandria. Remembering this, and finding, as he thinks, an opportunity, he has exhibited his hostility. But nothing is stronger than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Truth is wont to conquer even with few words. I beseech your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> to remember me in your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to the Lord that I may have power to prevail against the waves that are beating me hither and there.</p>
