<h1>Letter 87</h1>

<p> <em>To Domnus, Bishop of Apamea.</em> </p>

<p>The law of brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> demanded that I should receive many letters from your godliness at this time. For the divine Apostle charges us to weep with them that weep and <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with them that do <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>.  I have not received a single one, although just lately I was visited by some of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of your <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> with the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Elias. Nevertheless I have written, and I salute your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>; and I make you acquainted with the fact that the consolation of the Master has stood me in stead of all other, for in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> not even had I as many mouths as I have hairs on my head, could I worthily praise Him for my being deemed worthy of suffering on account of my confession of Him, and for the apparent disgrace which I hold more august than any <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. And if I be banished to the uttermost parts of the earth all the more will I praise Him as being counted worthy of greater blessings. Nevertheless I hope your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> will put up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> for the quiet of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches. It is because of the storm that is assailing them that I wail and groan and lament. That quiet, as I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, was driven away by the Osrhoene <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a>,  who poured out countless words against me, although I had no share in their condemnation, nor in the sentence passed upon them; on the contrary, as your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, I besought that the communion might be given to them at <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a>. But slanderers find no difficulty in saying what they like. My consolation lies in the blessing of the Master who said, <q>Blessed are you when men shall revile you and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you and shall say all manner of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> against you <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> for my sake; <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> they the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> which were before you.</q> </p>
