<h1>Letter 87 (A.D. 405)</h1>

<p> <em>To His Brother Emeritus, Beloved and Longed For, Augustine Sends Greeting.</em></p>

<p>1. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is not on the possession of good talents and a liberal education that the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> depends; but when I hear of any one who is thus endowed holding a different view from that which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> imperatively insists upon on a point which admits of very easy examination, the more I wonder at such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, the more I burn with desire to make his acquaintance, and to converse with him; or if that be impossible, I long to bring his mind and mine into contact by exchanging letters, which wing their flight even between places far apart. As I have heard that you are such a man as I have spoken of, I grieve that you should be severed and shut out from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is spread abroad throughout the whole world, as was foretold by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. What your reason for this separation is I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>. For it is not disputed that the party of Donatus is wholly unknown to a great part of the Roman world, not to speak of the barbarian nations (to whom also the apostle said that he was a debtor <span class="stiki" id="note112086"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse14">Romans&nbsp;1:14</a></span>) whose communion in the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is joined with ours, and that in fact they do not even <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> at all when or upon what account the dissension began. Now, unless you admit these <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> to be innocent of those crimes with which you charge the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of Africa, you must confess that all of you are defiled by participation in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> actions of all worthless characters, so long as they succeed (to put the matter mildly) in escaping detection among you. For you do occasionally expel a member from your communion, in which case his expulsion takes place only after he has committed the crime for which he merited expulsion. Is there not some intervening time during which he escapes detection before he is discovered, convicted, and condemned by you? I ask, therefore, whether he involved you in his defilement so long as he was not discovered by you? You answer, <q>By no means.</q> If, then, he were not to be discovered at all, he would in that case never involve you in his defilement; for it sometimes happens that the crimes committed by men come to light only after their death, yet this does not bring guilt upon those <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who communicated with them while they were alive. Why, then, have you severed yourselves by so rash and profane <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> from the communion of innumerable Eastern Churches, in which all that you <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> affirm to have been done in Africa has been and still is utterly unknown?</p> 

<p>2. For it is quite another question whether or not there be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in the assertions made by you. These assertions we disprove by documents much more worthy of credit than those which you bring forward, and we further find in your own documents more abundant <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of those positions which you assail. But this is, as I have said, another question altogether, to be taken up and discussed when necessary. Meanwhile, let your mind give special attention to this: that no one can be involved in the guilt of unknown crimes committed by <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> unknown to him. Whence it is manifest that you have been guilty of impious <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in separating yourselves from the communion of the whole world, to which the things charged, whether <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> or <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, by you against some men in Africa, have been and still are wholly unknown; although this also should not be forgotten, that even when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and discovered, bad men do not harm the good who are in a Church, if either the power of restraining them from communion be wanting, or the interests of the Church's peace forbid this to be done. For who were those who, according to the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Ezekiel,  obtained the reward of being marked before the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, and of escaping unhurt when they were destroyed, but those who sighed and cried for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and iniquities of the people of God which were done in the midst of them? Now who sighs and cries for that which is unknown to him? On the same principle, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> bears with false brethren. For it is not of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> unknown to him that he says, <q>All seek their own, not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s;</q> yet these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> he shows plainly to have been beside him. And to what class do the men belong who have chosen rather to burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> or surrender the divine books than to suffer death, if not to those who <q>seek their own, not the things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a></q>?</p>

<p>3. I omit many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> which I might give from Scripture, that I may not make this letter longer than is needful; and I leave many more things to be considered by yourself in the light of your own learning. But I beseech you mark this, which is quite enough to decide the whole question: If so many transgressors in the one nation, which was then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, did not make those who were associated with them to be guilty like themselves; if that multitude of false brethren did not make the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who was a member of the same Church with them, a seeker not of the things of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, but of his own&mdash;it is manifest that a man is not made <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of any one with whom he goes to the altar of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even though he be not unknown to him, provided only that he do not encourage him in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but by a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> disallowing his conduct keep himself apart from him. It is therefore obvious that, to be art and part with a thief, one must either help him in the theft, or receive with approbation what he has stolen. This I say in order to remove out of the way endless and unnecessary questions concerning the conduct of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, which are wholly irrelevant when advanced against our position.</p>

<p>4. If, however, you do not agree with what I have said, you involve the whole of your party in the reproach of being such men as Optatus was, while, notwithstanding your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of his crimes, he was tolerated in communion with you; and far be it from me to say this of such a man as Emeritus, and of others of like integrity among you, who are, I am sure, wholly averse to such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> as disgraced him. For we do not lay any charge against you but the one of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, which by your obstinate persistence in it you have now made <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. How great this crime is in the <a href="../cathen/08549a.htm">judgment of God</a> Himself, you may see by reading what without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> you have read ere now. You will find that Dathan and Abiram were swallowed up by an opening of the earth beneath them, <span class="stiki" id="note112088"><a href="../bible/num016.htm#verse31">Numbers&nbsp;16:31-35</a></span> and that all the others who had conspired with them were devoured by fire breaking forth in the midst of them. As a warning to men to shun this crime, the Lord God signalized its commission with this immediate punishment, that He might show what He reserves for the final recompense of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> guilty of a similar transgression, whom His great forbearance spares for a time. We do not, indeed, find fault with the reasons by which you excuse your tolerating Optatus among you. We do not blame you, because at the time when he was denounced for his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">furious</a> conduct in the mad abuse of power, when he was impeached by the groans of all Africa,&mdash; groans in which you also shared, if you are what good report declares you to be&mdash;a report which, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, I most willingly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>&mdash;you forbore from excommunicating him, lest he should under such sentence draw away many with him, and rend your communion asunder with the frenzy of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. But this is the thing which is itself an indictment against you at the bar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, O brother Emeritus, that although you saw that the division of the party of Donators was so great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that it was thought better that Optatus should be tolerated in your communion than that division should be introduced among you, you nevertheless perpetuate the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which was wrought in the division of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> by your forefathers.</p>

<p>5. Here perhaps you will be disposed, under the exigencies of debate, to attempt to defend Optatus. Do not so, I beseech you; do not so, my brother: it would not become you; and if it would perchance be seemly for any one to do it (though, in fact, nothing is seemly which is wrong), it assuredly would be unseemly for Emeritus to defend Optatus. Perhaps you reply that it would as little become you to accuse him. Granted, by all means. Take, then, the course which lies between defending and accusing him. Say, <q>Every man shall bear his own burden;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112089"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse5">Galatians&nbsp;6:5</a></span> <q>Who are you that judgest another man's servant?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112090"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;14:4</a></span> If, then, notwithstanding the testimony of all Africa,&mdash; nay more, of all regions to which the name of Gildo was carried, for Optatus was not less notorious than he&mdash;you have not dared to pronounce judgment concerning Optatus, lest you should rashly decide in regard to one unknown to you, is it, I ask, either possible or right for us, proceeding solely on your testimony, to pronounce sentence rashly upon <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom we do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>? Is it not enough that you should charge them with things of which you have no certain <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, without our pronouncing them guilty of things of which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as little as yourselves? For even though Optatus were in peril through the <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> of detractors, you defend not him, but yourself, when you say, <q>I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what his character was.</q> How much more obvious, then, is it that the Eastern world <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing of the character of those Africans with whom, though much less <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you than Optatus, you find fault! Yet you are disjoined by scandalous <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> from Churches in the East, the names of which you have and you read in the sacred books. If your most famous and most scandalously notorious Bishop of Thamugada  was at that very time not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to his colleague, I shall not say in C&aelig;sarea, but in Sitifa, so close at hand, how was it possible for the Churches of Corinth, Ephesus, Colosse, Philippi, Thessalonica, <a href="../cathen/01570a.htm">Antioch</a>, <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a>, Galatia, Cappadocia, and others which were founded in Christ by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the case of these African traditors, whoever they were; or how was it consistent with <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> that they should be condemned by you for not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it? Yet with these Churches you hold no communion. You say they are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, and you labour to rebaptize their members. What need I say? What complaint, what protest is necessary here? If I am addressing a right-hearted man, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that with you I share the keenness of the indignation which I feel. For you doubtless see at once what I might say if I would.</p>

<p>6. Perhaps, however, your forefathers formed of themselves a council, and placed the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world except themselves under sentence of excommunication. Have you come so to judge of things, as to affirm that the council of the followers of Maximianus who were cut off from you, as you were cut off from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was of no authority against you, because their number was small compared with yours; and yet claim for your council an authority against the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, which are the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the ends of the earth, which are His possession?  I wonder if the man who does not blush at such pretensions has any blood in his body. Write me, I beseech you, in reply to this letter; for I have heard from some, on whom I could not but rely, that you would write me an answer if I were to address a letter to you. Some time ago, moreover, I sent you a letter; but I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether you received it or answered it, and perhaps your reply did not reach me. Now, however, I beg you not to refuse to answer this letter, and state what you think. But do not occupy yourself with other questions than the one which I have stated, for this is the leading point of a well-ordered discussion of the origin of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.</p>

<p>7. The civil powers defend their conduct in <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> schismatics by the rule which the apostle laid down: <q>Whoso resists the power, resists the ordinance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and they that resist shall receive to themselves judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Will you then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and you shall have praise of the same: for he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a revenger to execute <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon him that does <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112093"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;13:2-4</a></span> The whole question therefore is, whether <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> be not an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> work, or whether you have not caused <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, so that your resistance of the powers that be is in a good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> and not in an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> work, whereby you would bring judgment on yourselves. Wherefore with <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> wisdom the Lord not merely said, <q>Blessed are they who are <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>,</q> but added, <q>for righteousness' sake.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112094"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse10">Matthew&nbsp;5:10</a></span> I desire therefore to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> from you, in the light of what I have said above, whether it be a work of righteousness to originate and perpetuate your state of separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. I desire also to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether it be not rather a work of unrighteousness to condemn unheard the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world, either because it has not heard what you have heard, or because no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> has been furnished to it of charges which were rashly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, or without sufficient evidence advanced by you, and to propose on this ground to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> a second time the members of so many churches founded by the preaching and labours either of the Lord Himself while He was on earth, or of His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>; and all this on the assumption that it is excusable for you either not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of your African colleagues who are living beside you, and are using the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> with you, or even to tolerate their misdeeds when <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, lest the party of Donatus should be divided, but that it is inexcusable for them, though they reside in most remote regions, to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what you either <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, or have heard, or <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, concerning men in Africa. How great is the perversity of those who cling to their own unrighteousness, and yet find fault with the severity of the civil powers!</p>

<p>8. You answer, perhaps, that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> ought not to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> even the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>. Be it so; let us admit that they ought not: but is it lawful to lay this objection in the way of the powers which are ordained for this very purpose? Shall we erase the apostle's words? Or do your manuscripts not contain the words which I mentioned a little while ago? But you will say that we ought not to communicate with such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. What then? Did you withdraw, some time ago, from communion with the deputy Flavianus, on the ground of his putting to death, in his administration of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, those whom he found guilty? Again, you will say that the Roman emperors are incited against you by us. Nay, rather blame yourselves for this, seeing that, as was long ago foretold in the promise concerning Christ, <q>Yea, all kings shall fall down before him,</q>  they are now members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and you have dared to wound the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and still presume to insist upon rebaptizing her members. Our brethren indeed demand help from the powers which are ordained, not to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> you, but to protect themselves against the lawless acts of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> perpetrated by individuals of your party, which you yourselves, who refrain from such things, bewail and deplore; just as, before the Roman Empire became <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> took measures to secure that the protection of armed Roman soldiers should be granted him against the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> who had conspired to kill him. But these emperors, whatever the occasion of their becoming acquainted with the crime of your <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> might be, frame against you such decrees as their <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and their office demand. For they bear not the sword in vain; they are the ministers of God to execute <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> upon those that do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Finally, if some of our party transgress the bounds of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> moderation in this matter, it displeases us; nevertheless, we do not on their account forsake the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> because we are unable to separate the wheat from the chaff before the final winnowing, especially since you yourselves have not forsaken the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> party on account of Optatus, when you had not <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> to excommunicate him for his crimes.</p>

<p>9. You say, however, <q>Why seek to have us joined to you, if we be thus stained with guilt?</q> I reply: Because you still live, and may, if you are willing, be restored. For when you join yourselves to us, <em>i.e.</em> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, the heritage of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who has the ends of the earth as his possession, you are restored so that you live in vital union with the Root. For the apostle says of the branches which were broken off: <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is able to graft them in again.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112096"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;11:23</a></span> We exhort you to change, in so far as concerns your dissent from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; although, as to the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which you had, we admit that they are <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, since they are the same in all. Wherefore we desire to see you changed from your obstinacy, that is, in order that you who have been cut off may be vitally united to the Root again. For the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which you have not changed are approved by us as you have them; else, in our attempting to correct your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, we should do impious wrong to those <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of Christ which have not been deprived of their worth by your unworthiness. For even Saul did not, with all his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, destroy the efficacy of the anointing which he received; to which anointing David, that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> servant of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, showed so great respect. We therefore do not insist upon rebaptizing you, because we only wish to restore to you connection with the Root: the form of the branch which has been cut off we accept with approval, if it has not been changed; but the branch, however perfect in its form, cannot bear fruit, except it be united to the root. As to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, so gentle and tempered with clemency, which you say you suffer at the hands of our party, while unquestionably your own party inflict greater harm in a lawless and irregular way upon us&mdash;this is one question: the question concerning <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is wholly distinct from it; in regard to it, we inquire not where it is, but where it profits. For wherever it is, it is the same; but it cannot be said of him who receives it, that wherever he is, he is the same. We therefore detest the impiety of which men as individuals are guilty in a state of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; but we venerate everywhere the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If deserters carry with them the imperial standards, these standards are welcomed back again as they were, if they have remained unharmed, when the deserters are either punished with a severe sentence, or, in the exercise of clemency, restored. If, in regard to this, any more particular inquiry is to be made, that is, as I have said another question; for in these things, the practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> is the rule of our practice.</p>

<p>10. The question between us, however, is, whether your Church or ours is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. To resolve this, we must begin with the original inquiry, why you became schismatics. If you do not write me an answer, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that before the bar of God I shall be easily vindicated as having done my duty in this matter; because I have sent a letter in the interests of peace to a man of whom I have heard that, excepting only his adherence to schismatics, he is a good and well-<a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a> man. Be it yours to consider how you shall answer Him whose forbearance now demands your praise, and His judgment shall in the end demand your fears. If, however, you write a reply to me with as much care as you see me to have bestowed upon this, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that, by the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which now keeps us apart shall perish before the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of peace and the logic of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Observe that I have said nothing about the followers of Rogatus,  who call you Firmiani, as you call us Macariani. Nor have I spoken of your <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Rucata (or Rusicada), who is said to have made an agreement with Firmus, promising, on condition of the safety of all his adherents, that the gates should be opened to him, and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> given up to slaughter and pillage. Many other such things I pass unnoticed. Do you therefore in like manner desist from the commonplaces of rhetorical exaggeration concerning actions of men which you have either heard of or <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>; for you see how I am silent concerning <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of your party, in order to confine the debate to the question upon which the whole matter hinges, namely, the origin of the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.</p>

<p>My brother, beloved and longed for, may the Lord our God breathe into you thoughts tending towards reconciliation.</p>
