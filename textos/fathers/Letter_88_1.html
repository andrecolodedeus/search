<h1>Letter 88</h1>

<p><strong>To Theophilus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Replying to the preceding letter Jerome again congratulates Theophilus on the success of his efforts to put down Origenism, and informs him that they have already borne fruit as far west as <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>. He then asks him for the decrees of his council (held recently at Alexandria). The date of the letter is 400 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>Jerome to the most blessed pope Theophilus. The letter of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has given me a twofold pleasure, partly because it has had for its bearers those reverend and estimable men, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Agatho and the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Athanasius, and partly because it has shown your <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> against a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. The voice of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> has rung throughout the world, and to the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of all Christ's churches the poisonous suggestions of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> have been silenced. The old serpent <span class="stiki" id="note302621"><a href="../bible/rev012.htm#verse9">Revelation&nbsp;12:9</a></span> hisses no longer, but, writhing and disembowelled, lurks in dark caverns unable to bear the shining of the sun. I have already, before the writing of your letter, sent missives to the West pointing out to those of my own language some of the quibbles employed by the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. I hold it due to the special <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God that you should have written to the pope Anastasius  at the same time as myself, and should thus without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it have been the means of confirming my testimony. Now that you have directly urged me to do so, I shall show myself more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> than ever to recall from their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> simple <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> both near and far. Nor shall I hesitate, if needful, to incur odium with some, for we ought to please God rather than men: <span class="stiki" id="note302623"><a href="../bible/act005.htm#verse29">Acts&nbsp;5:29</a></span> although indeed they have been much more forward to defend their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> than I and others have been to attack it. At the same time I beg that if you have any synodical decrees bearing upon the subject you will forward them to me, that, strengthened with the authority of so great a prelate, I may open my mouth for Christ with more freedom and confidence. The <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Vincent has arrived from Rome two days ago and humbly salutes you. He tells me again and again that Rome and almost the whole of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> owe their deliverance after Christ to your letters. Show diligence therefore, most loving and most blessed pope, and whenever opportunity offers write to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the West not to hesitate&mdash; in your own words &mdash; to cut down with a sharp sickle the sprouts of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>
