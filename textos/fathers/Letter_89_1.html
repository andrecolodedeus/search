<h1>Letter 89</h1>

<p><strong>From Theophilus to Jerome</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">This letter (probably earlier in date than the three preceding) commends to Jerome the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Theodore, who, having come from Rome to declare the condemnation of Origenism by the church there, had visited the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Nitria now purged of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and wished before returning to the West to see the Holy Places as well. The date of the letter is 400 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>Theophilus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, to the well-beloved lord and most loving brother the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Jerome. I have learned the project of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monk</a> Theodore&mdash; which will be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> also to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>&mdash; and I approve of it. Having to leave us on a voyage for <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, he has been unwilling to set out without first visiting and embracing as his own flesh and blood you and the reverend brothers who are with you in the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a>. You will, I am sure, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the news with which he will meet your welcome, that quiet has been restored to the church here. He has seen all the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Nitria and can tell you of the continence and meekness of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> in them; as also how the Origenists have been put down and scattered, how peace has been restored to the church, and how the discipline of the Lord is being upheld. How gladly would I see the mask of hypocrisy laid aside by those also who near you are said to be undermining the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. I feel <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to write thus because the brothers in your neighbourhood  are mistaken concerning them. Wherefore take heed to yourselves and shun men of this type; even as it is written:&mdash; <q>if any man bring not to you the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the church, bid him not God speed.</q>  It may, indeed, be superfluous to write thus to you who can recall the erring from their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, yet no harm is done when those careful for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> admonish even the wise and learned. Kindly salute in my name all the brothers who are with you.</p>
