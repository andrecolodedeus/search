<h1>Letter 89 (A.D. 406)</h1>

<p> <em>To Festus, My Lord Well Beloved, My Son Honourable and Worthy of Esteem, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. If, on behalf of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and inexcusable dissension, and falsehoods which have been in every way possible disproved, men are so presumptuous as to persevere in boldly assailing and threatening the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which seeks their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, how much more is it reasonable and right for those who maintain the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> peace and unity,&mdash; <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which commends itself even to those who profess to deny it or attempt to resist it&mdash;to labour constantly and with energy, not only in the defence of those who are already <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, but also for the correction of those who are not yet within the Church! For if obstinacy aims at the possession and exercise of indomitable strength, how great should be the strength of constancy which devotes persevering and unwearied labours to a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> to be both pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and beyond all question necessarily approved by the judgment of wise men!</p>

<p>2. Could there, moreover, be anything more lamentable as an instance of perversity, than for men not only to refuse to be humbled by the correction of their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, but even to claim commendation for their conduct, as is done by the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, when they boast that they are the victims of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; either through incredible blindness not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a>, or through inexcusable passion pretending not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that men are made <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> not by the amount of their suffering, but by the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in which they suffer? This I would say even were I opposing men who were only involved in the darkness of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and suffering penalties on that account most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> merited, and who had not dared to assault any one with insane <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>. But what shall I say against those whose fatal obstinacy is such that it is checked only by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of losses, and is taught only by exile how universal (as had been foretold) is the diffusion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which they prefer to attack rather then to acknowledge? And if the things which they suffer under this most gentle discipline be compared with those things which they in reckless fury perpetrate, who does not see to which party the name of persecutors more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> belongs? Nay, even though <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> sons abstain from <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, they do, by their abandoned way of life, inflict upon their affectionate <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> a much more serious wrong than their father and mother inflict upon them, when, with a sternness proportioned to the strength of their <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, they endeavour without dissimulation to compel them to live uprightly.</p>

<p>3. There exist the strongest evidences in public documents, which you can read if you please, or rather, which I beseech and exhort you to read, by which it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that their predecessors, who originally separated themselves from the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, did of their own accord dare to bring accusation against C&aelig;cilianus before the Emperor by means of Anulinus, who was proconsul at that time. Had they gained the day in that trial, what else would C&aelig;cilianus have suffered at the hands of the Emperor than that which, when they were defeated, he awarded to them? But <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, if they having accused him had prevailed, and C&aelig;cilianus and his colleagues had been expelled from their sees, or, through persisting in their conspiracy, had exposed themselves to severer punishments (for the imperial censure could not pass unpunished the resistance of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had been defeated in the civil courts), they would then have published as worthy of all praise the Emperor's wise measures and anxious care for the good of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But now, because they have themselves lost their case, being wholly unable to prove the charges which they advanced, if they suffer anything for their iniquity, they call it <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>; and not only set no bounds to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, but also claim to be honoured as <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>: as if the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> emperors were following in their measures against their most obstinate <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> any other precedent than the decision of Constantine, to whom they of their own accord appealed as the accusers of C&aelig;cilianus, and whose authority they so esteemed above that of all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> beyond the sea, that to him rather than to them they referred this <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> dispute. To him, again, they protested against the first judgment given against them by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> whom he had appointed to examine the case in <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, and to him also they appealed against the second judgment given by the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> at Arles: yet when at last they were defeated by his own decision, they remained unchanged in their perversity. I think that even the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself would not have had the assurance to persist in such a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, if he had been so often overthrown by the authority of the judge to whom he had of his own will chosen to appeal.</p>

<p>4. It may be said, however, that these are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> tribunals, and that they might have been cajoled, misguided, or <a href="../cathen/02778c.htm">bribed</a>. Why, then, is the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world libelled and branded with the crime laid to the charge of some who are said to have surrendered to persecutors the sacred books? For surely it was neither possible for the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world, nor incumbent upon it, to do otherwise than <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the judges whom the plaintiffs had chosen, rather than the plaintiffs against whom these judges pronounced judgments. These judges are responsible to God for their opinion, whether just or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; but what has the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, diffused throughout the world, done that it should be deemed necessary for her to be rebaptized by the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> upon no other ground than because, in a case in which she was not able to decide as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, she has thought herself called upon to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> those who were in a position to judge it rightly, rather than those who, though defeated in the civil courts, refused to yield? O weighty indictment against all the nations to which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> promised that they should be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the seed of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and has now made His promise good! When they with one voice demand, Why do you wish to rebaptize us? The answer given is, Because you do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what men in Africa were guilty of surrendering the sacred books; and being thus <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, accepted the testimony of the judges who decided the case as more worthy of credit than that of those by whom the accusation was brought. No man deserves to be blamed for the crime of another; what, then, has the whole world to do with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which some one in Africa may have committed? No man deserves to be blamed for a crime about which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> nothing; and how could the whole world possibly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the crime in this case, whether the judges or the party condemned were guilty? You who have understanding, judge what I say. Here is the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>: the party of Donatus condemns the whole world unheard, because the whole world does not condemn a crime unknown. But for the world, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, it suffices to have the promises of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to see fulfilled in itself what <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> predicted so long ago, and to recognise the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by means of the same Scriptures by which Christ her King is recognised. For as in them are foretold concerning Christ the things which we read in gospel history to have been fulfilled in Him, so also in them have been foretold concerning the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the things which we now behold fulfilled in the world.</p>

<p>5. Possibly some thinking people might be disturbed by what they are accustomed to say regarding <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, viz. that it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ only when it is administered by a righteous man, were it not that on this subject the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world holds what is most manifestly evangelical <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as taught in the words of John: <q>He that sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112118"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> calmly declines to place her hope in man, lest she fall under the curse pronounced in Scripture, <q>Cursed be the man that trusts in man,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note112119"><a href="../bible/jer017.htm#verse5">Jeremiah&nbsp;17:5</a></span> but places her hope in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, who so took upon Him the form of a servant as not to lose the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, of whom it is said, <q>The same is He which baptizes.</q> Therefore, whoever the man be, and whatever office he bear who administers the ordinance, it is not he who baptizes,&mdash; that is the work of Him upon whom the dove descended. So great is the absurdity in which the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> are involved in consequence of these foolish opinions, that they can find no escape from it. For when they admit the validity and reality of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> when one of their <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> baptizes who is a guilty man, but whose guilt is concealed, we ask them, Who baptizes in this case? And they can only answer, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for they cannot affirm that a man guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> (say of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>) can sanctify any one. If, then, when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is administered by a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be righteous, he sanctifies the person <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; but when it is administered by a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> man, whose <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> is hidden, it is not he, but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who sanctifies. Those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> ought to wish to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> rather by men who are secretly bad than by men manifestly good, for God sanctifies much more effectually than any righteous man can do. If it be palpably absurd that one about to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> ought to wish to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by a <a href="../cathen/07610a.htm">hypocritical</a> adulterer rather than by a man of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, it follows plainly, that whoever be the minister that dispenses the rite, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is valid, because He Himself baptizes upon whom the dove descended.</p>

<p>6. Notwithstanding the impression which <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> so obvious should produce on the ears and hearts of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, such is the whirlpool of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> custom by which some have been engulfed, that rather than yield, they will resist both authority and argument of every kind. Their resistance is of two kinds&mdash; either with active rage or with passive immobility. What remedies, then, must the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> apply when seeking with a mother's anxiety the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of them all, and distracted by the frenzy of some and the lethargy of others? Is it right, is it possible, for her to despise or give up any means which may promote their recovery? She must necessarily be esteemed burdensome by both, just because she is the enemy of neither. For men in frenzy do not like to be bound, and men in lethargy do not like to be stirred up; nevertheless the diligence of charity perseveres in restraining the one and stimulating the other, out of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to both. Both are provoked, but both are loved; both, while they continue under their infirmity, resent the treatment as vexatious; both express their thankfulness for it when they are cured.</p>

<p>7. Moreover, whereas they think and boast that we receive them into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> just as they were, it is not so. We receive them completely changed, because they do not begin to be <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> until they have ceased to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For their <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which we have in common with them, are not the objects of dislike to us, because they are not <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but Divine. That which must be taken from them is the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, which is their own, and which they have wickedly imbibed; not the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which they have received like ourselves, and which they bear and have&mdash;to their own condemnation, indeed, because they use them so unworthily; nevertheless, they <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> have them. Wherefore, when their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is forsaken, and the perversity of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> corrected in them, they pass over from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> into the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which they formerly did not possess, and without which all that they did possess was only doing them harm. If, however, in thus passing over they are not sincere, this is a matter not for us, but for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to judge. And yet, some who were suspected of insincerity because they had passed over to us through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, have been found in some subsequent <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> so faithful as to surpass others who had been originally <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. Therefore let it not be said that nothing is accomplished when strong measures are employed. For when the entrenchments of stubborn custom are stormed by <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> authority, this is not all that is done, because at the same time <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is strengthened, and the understanding convinced, by authority and arguments which are Divine.</p>

<p>8. These things being so, be it <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to your Grace that your men in the region of Hippo are still <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, and that your letter has had no influence upon them. The reason why it failed to move them I need not write; but send some one, either a servant or a friend of your own, whose fidelity you can entrust with the commission, and let him come not to them in the first place, but to us without their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>; and when he has carefully consulted with us as to what is best to be done, let him do it with the Lord's help. For in these measures we are acting not only for their welfare, but also on behalf of our own men who have become <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, to whom the vicinity of these <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> is so dangerous, that it cannot be looked upon by us as a small matter.</p>

<p>I could have written much more briefly; but I wished you to have a letter from me, by which you might not only be yourself informed of the reason of my solicitude, but also be provided with an answer to any one who might dissuade you from earnestly devoting your energies to the correction of the people who belong to you, and might speak against us for wishing you to do this. If in this I have done what was unnecessary, because you had yourself either learned or thought out these principles, or if I have been burdensome to you by inflicting so long a letter upon one so engrossed with public affairs, I beg you to forgive me. I only entreat you not to despise what I have brought before you and requested at your hands. May the mercy of God be your safeguard!</p>
