<h1>Letter 8</h1>

<p><strong> <em>BY ST. GREGORY OF NYSSA</em></strong></p>

<p> <em>To a Student of the Classics</em></p>

<p>When I was looking for some suitable and proper exordium, I mean of course from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, to put at the head of my letter, according to my usual custom, I did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> which to choose, not from inability to find what was suitable, but because I deemed it superfluous to write such things to those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> nothing about the matter. For your eager pursuit of profane literature <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> incontestably to us that you did not care about sacred. Accordingly I will say nothing about <a href="../bible/index.html">Bible</a> texts, but will select a prelude adapted to your literary tastes taken from the poets you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> so well. By the great master of your education there is introduced one, showing all an old man's <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, when after long affliction he once more beheld his son, and his son's son as well. And the special theme of his exultation is the rivalry between the two, Ulysses and Telemachus, for the highest meed of valour, though it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the recollection of his own exploits against the Cephallenians adds to the point of his speech.  For you and your admirable father, when you welcomed me, as they did Laertes, in your affection, contended in most <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> rivalry for the prize of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, by showing us all possible respect and kindness; he in numerous ways which I need not here mention, and you by pelting me with  your letters from Cappadocia. What, then, of me the aged one? I count that day one to be blessed, in which I <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> such a competition between father and son. May you, then, never cease from accomplishing the rightful <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of an excellent and admirable father, and surpassing in your readiness to all good works the renown which from him you inherit. I shall be a judge acceptable to both of you, as I shall award you the first prize against your father, and the same to your father against you. And we will put up with rough Ithaca, rough not so much with stones as with the manners of the inhabitants, an island in which there are many suitors, who are suitors  most of all for the possessions of her whom they woo, and insult their intended bride by this very fact, that they threaten her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> with marriage, acting in a way worthy of a Melantho, one might say, or some other such person; for nowhere is there a Ulysses to bring them to their senses with his bow. You see how in an old man's fashion I go maundering off into matters with which you have no concern. But <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> let indulgence be readily extended to me in consideration of my grey hairs; for garrulity is just as characteristic of old age as to be blear-eyed, or for the limbs to fail.  But you by entertaining us with your brisk and lively language, like a bold young man as you are, will make our old age young again, supporting the feebleness of our length of days with this kind attention which so well becomes you.</p>
