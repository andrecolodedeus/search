<h1>Letter 8</h1>

<p><strong>To Niceas, Sub-Deacon of Aquileia</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Niceas, the <a href="../cathen/14320a.htm">sub-deacon</a>, had accompanied Jerome to the East but had now returned home. In after-years he became <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Aquileia in succession to Chromatius. The date of the letter is 374 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>The comic poet Turpilius  says of the exchange of letters that it alone makes the absent present. The remark, though occurring in a work of fiction, is not untrue. For what more real presence&mdash; if I may so speak&mdash; can there be between absent friends than speaking to those whom they <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in letters, and in letters hearing their reply? Even those Italian savages, the Cascans of Ennius, who&mdash; as Cicero tells us in his books on rhetoric&mdash; hunted their food like beasts of prey, were wont, before paper and parchment came into use, to exchange letters written on tablets of wood roughly planed, or on strips of bark torn from the trees. For this reason men called letter-carriers tablet-bearers,  and letter-writers bark-users,  because they used the bark of trees. How much more then are we, who live in a civilized age, bound not to omit a social duty performed by men who lived in a state of gross savagery, and were in some respects entirely <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the refinements of life. The saintly Chromatius, look you, and the reverend Eusebius, brothers as much by compatibility of disposition as by the ties of nature, have challenged me to diligence by the letters which they have showered upon me. You, however, who have but just left me, have not merely unknit our new-made friendship; you have torn it asunder&mdash; a process which L&aelig;lius, in Cicero's treatise,  wisely forbids. Can it be that the East is so hateful to you that you dread the thought of even your letters coming hither? Wake up, wake up, arouse yourself from sleep, give to affection at least one sheet of paper. Amid the pleasures of life at home sometimes heave a sigh over the journeys which we have made together. If you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> me, write in answer to my <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. If you are <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with me, though <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> still write. I find my longing <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> much comforted when I receive a letter from a friend, even though that friend be out of temper with me.</p>
