<h1>Letter 8</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To the C&aelig;sareans</em>. <em>A defence of his withdrawal, and concerning the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em>.</p>

<p>1. I have often been astonished at your feeling towards me as you do, and how it comes about that an individual so small and insignificant, and having, maybe, very little that is lovable about him, should have so won your allegiance. You remind me of the claims of friendship and of fatherland,  and press me urgently in your attempt to make me come back to you, as though I were a runaway from a father's heart and home. That I am a runaway I confess. I should be sorry to deny it; since you are already regretting me, you shall be told the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>. I was astounded like a man stunned by some sudden noise. I did not crush my thoughts, but dwelt upon them as I fled, and now I have been absent from you a considerable time. Then I began to yearn for the divine doctrines, and the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> that is concerned with them. How, said I, could I overcome the mischief dwelling with us? Who is to be my Laban, setting me free from <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, and leading me to the supreme <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>? By God's help, I have, so far as in me lies, attained my object; I have found a chosen vessel, a deep well; I mean Gregory, <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> mouth. Give me, therefore, I beg you, a little time. I am not embracing a city life.  I am quite well aware how the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one by such means devises deceit for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, but I do hold the society of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> most useful. For in the more constant change of ideas about the divine <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> I am acquiring a lasting habit of <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Such is my present situation.</p>

<p>2. Friends godly and well beloved, do, I implore you, beware of the shepherds of the <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistines</a>; let them not choke your wills unawares; let them not befoul the purity of your <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. This is ever their object, not to teach simple <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> lessons drawn from <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, but to mar the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>. Is not he an open <a href="../cathen/12021c.htm">Philistine</a> who is introducing the terms <q> <em>unbegotten</em></q> and <q> <em>begotten</em></q> into our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and asserts that there was once a time when the Everlasting was not;  that He who is by nature and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternally</a> a Father became a Father; that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>? He bewitches our Patriarch's sheep that they may not drink <q>of the well of water springing up into everlasting life,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321783"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;4:14</a></span> but may rather bring upon themselves the words of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, <q>They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321784"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse13">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:13</a></span> when all the while they ought to confess that the Father is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Son <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  as they have been taught by the divine words, and by those who have understood them in their highest sense. Against those who cast it in our teeth that we are Tritheists, let it be answered that we confess one God not in number but in nature. For everything which is called one in number is not one absolutely, nor yet simple in nature; but <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is universally confessed to be simple and not composite. God therefore is not one in number. What I mean is this. We say that the world is one in number, but not one by nature nor yet simple; for we divide it into its constituent elements, fire, water, air, and earth.  Again, man is called one in number. We frequently speak of one man, but man who is composed of body and <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is not simple. Similarly we say one <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in number, but not one by nature nor yet simple, for we conceive of the hypostasis of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> as <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> with sanctification. If therefore everything which is one in number is not one in nature, and that which is one and simple in nature is not one in number; and if we call God one in nature how can number be charged against us, when we utterly exclude it from that blessed and spiritual nature? Number relates to quantity; and quantity is conjoined with bodily nature, for number is of bodily nature. We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> our Lord to be Creator of bodies. Wherefore every number indicates those things which have received a material and circumscribed nature. <a href="../cathen/10447b.htm">Monad</a> and Unity on the other hand signify the nature which is simple and incomprehensible. Whoever therefore confesses either the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> to be number or creature introduces unawares a material and circumscribed nature. And by circumscribed I mean not only locally limited, but a nature which is comprehended in foreknowledge by Him who is about to educe it from the non-existent into the existent and which can be comprehended by science. Every <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing then of which the nature is circumscribed and of which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is acquired is not insusceptible of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> are the source of sanctification by which every reasonable creature is hallowed in proportion to its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>.</p>

<p>3. We in accordance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine speak of the Son as neither like,  nor unlike  the Father. Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike are predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality. We, on the contrary, confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the composition of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, God in substance, Who begot the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, God in substance. From this the consubstantiality  is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>. For God in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or substance is co-essential or con-substantial with God in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> or substance. But when even man is called <q>god</q> as in the words, <q>I have said you are gods,</q>  and <q>d&aelig;mon</q> as in the words, <q>The gods of the nations are d&aelig;mons,</q>  in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly. God alone is substantially and essentially God. When I say <q>alone</q> I set forth the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and uncreated <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and substance of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For the word <q>alone</q> is used in the case of any individual and generally of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>. In the case of an individual, as for instance of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, that he alone was caught into the third heaven and <q>heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321792"><a href="../bible/2co012.htm#verse4">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:4</a></span> and of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>, as when David says, <q>as for man his days are as grass,</q>  not meaning any particular man, but <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> generally; for every man is short-lived and mortal. So we understand these words to be said of the nature, <q>who alone has <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note321794"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:16</a></span> and <q>to God only wise,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321795"><a href="../bible/rom016.htm#verse27">Romans&nbsp;16:27</a></span> and <q>none is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> save one, that is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321796"><a href="../bible/luk018.htm#verse19">Luke&nbsp;18:19</a></span> for here <q>one</q> means the same as alone. So also, <q>which alone spreadest out the heavens,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321797"><a href="../bible/job009.htm#verse8">Job&nbsp;9:8</a></span> and again <q>You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve.</q>  <q>There is no God beside me.</q>  In Scripture <q>one</q> and <q>only</q> are not predicated of God to mark distinction from the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, but to except the unreal gods <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> so called. As for instance, <q>The Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with them,</q>  and <q>then the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and did serve the Lord only.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321801"><a href="../bible/1sa007.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;7:4</a></span> And so St. <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, <q>For as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there is but one god, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, of whom are all things; and one Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> by Whom are all things.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321802"><a href="../bible/1co008.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;8:5-6</a></span> Here we enquire why when he had said <q>one God</q> he was not content, for we have said that <q>one</q> and <q>only</q> when applied to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, indicate nature. Why did he add the word Father and make mention of Christ? <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, a chosen vessel, did not, I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, think it sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he had expressed by the phrase <q>one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> without, by the further addition of <q>the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning the Lord, signifying the Word by Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, announcing the <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection. For the word <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> suggests all these ideas to us. For this reason too before His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> our Lord deprecates the designation of <q><a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>,</q> and charges His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to <q>tell no man that He was <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the Christ.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321803"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;16:19</a></span> For His purpose was, after the completion of the &oelig;conomy,  after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a> from the dead, and His assumption into heaven, to commit to them the preaching of Him as <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, the Christ. Such is the force of the words <q>That they may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> You the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> whom you have sent,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321805"><a href="../bible/joh017.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;17:3</a></span> and again <q>You <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> also in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321806"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;14:1</a></span> Everywhere the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> secures our conception of Him to save us from falling in one direction while we advance in the other, heeding the theology but neglecting the &oelig;conomy,  and so by omission falling into impiety.</p>

<p>4. Now let us examine, and to the best of our ability explain, the meaning of the words of <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a>, which our opponents seize and wrest to their own sense, and urge against us for the destruction of the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Only-begotten. First of all take the words <q>I live because of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q>  for this is one of the shafts hurled heavenward by those who impiously use it. These words I do not understand to refer to the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; for whatever lives because of something else cannot be self-existent, just as that which is warmed by another cannot be warmth itself; but He Who is our Christ and God says, <q>I am the life.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321809"><a href="../bible/joh011.htm#verse25">John&nbsp;11:25</a></span> I understand the life lived because of the Father to be this life in the flesh, and in this time. Of His own will He came to live the life of men. He did not say <q>I have lived because of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> but <q>I live because of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>,</q> clearly indicating the present time, and the <a href="../cathen/10212c.htm">Christ</a>, having the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in Himself, is able to call the life which He leads, life, and that this is His meaning we shall learn from what follows. <q>He that eats me,</q> He says, <q>he also shall live because of me;</q>  for we eat His flesh, and drink His blood, being made through His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a> and His visible life partakers of His Word and of His Wisdom. For all His mystic sojourn among us He called flesh and blood, and set forth the teaching consisting of practical science, of physics, and of theology, whereby our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is nourished and is meanwhile trained for the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of actual realities. This is perhaps the intended meaning of what He says. </p>

<p>5. And again, <q>My Father is greater than I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321812"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> This passage is also employed by the ungrateful creatures, the brood of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even from this passage the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father is set forth. For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that comparisons may properly be made between things which are of the same nature. We speak of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> as greater than <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, of man as juster than man, of bird as fleeter than bird. If then comparisons are made between things of the same species, and the Father by comparison is said to be greater than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, then the Son is of the same substance as the Father. But there is another sense underlying the expression. In what is it extraordinary that He who <q>is the Word and was made flesh</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321813"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse14">John&nbsp;1:14</a></span> confesses His Father to be greater than Himself, when He was seen in <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> inferior to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and in form to men? For <q>You have made him a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q>  and again <q>Who was made a little lower than the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321815"><a href="../bible/heb002.htm#verse9">Hebrews&nbsp;2:9</a></span> and <q>we saw Him and He had neither form nor comeliness, his form was deficient beyond all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q>  All this He endured on account of His abundant loving kindness towards His work, that He might save the lost sheep and bring it home when He had saved it, and bring back safe and sound to his own land the man who went down from Jerusalem to <a href="../cathen/08339a.htm">Jericho</a> and so fell among thieves.  Will the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> cast in His teeth the manger out of which he in his unreasonableness was fed by the Word of reason? Will he, because the carpenter's son had no bed to lie on, complain of His being poor? This is why the Son is less than the Father; for your sakes He was made dead to free you from death and make you sharer in heavenly life. It is just as though any one were to find fault with the physician for stooping to sickness, and breathing its foul breath, that he may heal the sick.</p>

<p>6. It is on your account that He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the hour and the day of judgment. Yet nothing is beyond the ken of the real Wisdom, for <q>all things were made by Him;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321818"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;1:3</a></span> and even among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> no one is <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of what he has made. But this is His dispensation  because of your own infirmity, that sinners be not plunged into despair by the narrow limits of the appointed period,  no opportunity for repentance being left them; and that, on the other hand, those who are waging a long <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the forces of the enemy may not desert their post on account of the protracted time. For both of these classes He arranges  by means of His assumed <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>; for the former cutting the time short for their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> struggle's sake; for the latter providing an opportunity for repentance because of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. In the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">gospels</a> He numbered Himself among the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, on account, as I have said, of the infirmity of the greater part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. In the Acts of the Apostles, speaking, as it were, to the perfect apart, He says, <q>It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times or the seasons which the Father has put in His own power.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321822"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse7">Acts&nbsp;1:7</a></span> Here He implicitly excepts Himself. So much for a rough statement by way of preliminary attack. Now let us enquire into the meaning of the text from a higher point of view. Let me knock at the door of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, if haply I may wake the Master of the house, Who gives the spiritual bread to them who ask Him, since they whom we are eager to entertain are friends and brothers.</p>

<p>7. Our Saviour's <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, after getting beyond the limits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thought, and then being purified by the word,  are enquiring about the end, and longing to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the ultimate blessedness which our Lord declared to be unknown to His <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and to Himself. He calls all the exact comprehension of the purposes of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a day; and the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of the One-ness and Unity, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of which He attributes to the Father alone, an hour. I apprehend, therefore, that God is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of Himself what is; and not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> what is not; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is, of His own nature, very righteousness and wisdom, is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> righteousness and wisdom; but to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of unrighteousness and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>; for God who created us is not unrighteousness and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>. If, then, God is said to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> about Himself that which is, and not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that which is not; and if our Lord, according to the purpose of the Incarnation and the denser doctrine, is not the ultimate object of desire; then our Saviour does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the end and the ultimate blessedness. But He says the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note321824"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse32">Mark&nbsp;13:32</a></span> that is to say, not even the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> which is in them, nor the methods of their ministries are the ultimate object of desire. For even their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, when compared with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> which is face to face, is dense.  Only the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, He says, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, since He is Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness, for when we no longer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> God in mirrors and not immediately,  but approach Him as one and alone, then we shall <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> even the ultimate end. For all material <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> is said to be the kingdom of Christ; while immaterial <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and so to say the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of actual Godhead, is that of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father. But our Lord is also Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness according to the purpose of the Word; for what does He say in the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>? <q>I will raise him up at the last day.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321827"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse40">John&nbsp;6:40</a></span> He calls the transition from material <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to immaterial <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> a resurrection, speaking of that <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> after which there is no other, as the last day: for our intelligence is raised up and roused to a height of blessedness at the time when it contemplates the One-ness and Unity of the Word. But since our intelligence is made dense and bound to earth, it is both commingled with clay and incapable of gazing intently in pure <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>, being led through adornments  cognate to its own body. It considers the operations of the Creator, and judges of them meanwhile by their effects, to the end that growing little by little it may one day wax strong enough to approach even the actual unveiled Godhead. This is the meaning, I think, of the words <q>my Father is greater than I,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321829"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse28">John&nbsp;14:28</a></span> and also of the statement, <q>It is not mine to give save to those for whom it is prepared by my Father.</q>  This too is what is meant by Christ's <q>delivering up the kingdom to God even the Father;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321831"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse24">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:24</a></span> inasmuch as according to the denser doctrine which, as I said, is regarded relatively to us and not to the Son Himself, He is not the end but the first fruits. It is in accordance with this view that when His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> asked Him again in the Acts of the Apostles, <q>When will you restore the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>?</q> He replied, <q>It is not for you to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the times or the seasons which the Father has put in His own power.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321832"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse6">Acts&nbsp;1:6-7</a></span> That is to say, the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of such a kingdom is not for them that are bound in flesh and blood. This <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> the Father has put away in His own power, meaning by <q>power</q> those that are empowered, and by <q>His own</q> those who are not held down by the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of things below. Do not, I beg you, have in mind times and seasons of sense but certain distinctions of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> made by the sun apprehended by mental perception. For our <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a> must be carried out. It is Jesus Who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> <q>Grant that they may be one in us as I and Thou are one, Father.</q>  For when <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who is one, is in each, He makes all out; and number is lost in the in-dwelling of Unity.</p>

<p>This is my second attempt to attack the text. If any one has a better interpretation to give, and can consistently with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion amend what I say, let him speak and let him amend, and the Lord will reward him for me. There is no jealousy in my heart. I have not approached this investigation of these passages for strife and vain <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. I have done so to help my brothers, lest the earthen vessels which hold the treasure of God should seem to be deceived by stony-hearted and uncircumcised men, whose weapons are the wisdom of folly. </p>

<p>8. Again, as is said through Solomon the Wise in the Proverbs, <q>He was created;</q> and He is named <q>Beginning of ways</q>  of good news, which lead us to the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>. He is not in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and substance a creature, but is made a <q>way</q> according to the &oelig;conomy. Being made and being created signify the same thing. As He was made a way, so was He made a door, a shepherd, an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, a sheep, and again a High Priest and an Apostle, <span class="stiki" id="note321836"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse1">Hebrews&nbsp;3:1</a></span> the names being used in other senses. What again would the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> say about God unsubjected, and about His being made <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> for us?  For it is written <q>But when all things shall be subdued unto Him, then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him.</q>  Are you not afraid, sir, of God called unsubjected? For He makes your subjection His own; and because of your struggling against goodness He calls himself unsubjected. In this sense too He once spoke of Himself as <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>&mdash; <q>Saul, Saul,</q> He says, <q>why do you persecute me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321839"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4</a></span> on the occasion when Saul was hurrying to Damascus with a desire to imprison the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>. Again He calls Himself naked, when any one of his brethren is naked. <q>I was naked,</q> He says, <q>and you clothed me;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321840"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse36">Matthew&nbsp;25:36</a></span> and so when another is in <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a> He speaks of Himself as imprisoned, for He Himself took away our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and bare our sicknesses.  Now one of our infirmities is not being subject, and He bare this. So all the things which happen to us to our hurt He makes His own, taking upon Him our sufferings in His fellowship with us.</p>

<p>9. But another passage is also seized by those who are fighting against God to the perversion of their hearers: I mean the words <q>The Son can do nothing of Himself.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321842"><a href="../bible/joh005.htm#verse19">John&nbsp;5:19</a></span> To me this saying too seems distinctly declaratory of the Son's being of the same nature as the Father. For if every rational creature is able to do anything of himself, and the inclination which each has to the worse and to the better is in his own power, but the Son can do nothing of Himself, then the Son is not a creature. And if He is not a creature, then He is of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and substance with the Father. Again; no creature can do what he likes. But the Son does what He wills in heaven and in earth. Therefore the Son is not a creature. Again; all creatures are either constituted of contraries or receptive of contraries. But the Son is very righteousness, and immaterial. Therefore the Son is not a creature, and if He is not a creature, He is of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and substance with the Father.</p>

<p>10. This examination of the passages before us is, so far as my ability goes, sufficient. Now let us turn the discussion on those who attack the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and cast down every high thing of their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> that exalts itself against the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note321843"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse5">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:5</a></span> You say that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is a creature. And every creature is a servant of the Creator, for <q>all are your servants.</q>  If then He is a servant, His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is acquired; and everything of which the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> is acquired is receptive of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; but the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> being <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> is called <q>fount of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321845"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;1:4</a></span> Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is not a creature. If He is not a creature, He is of one <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and substance with the Father. How, tell me, can you give the name of servant to Him Who through your <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> frees you from your servitude? <q>The law,</q> it is said, <q>of the Spirit of life has made me free from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321846"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;8:2</a></span> But you will never venture to call His nature even variable, so long as you have regard to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the opposing power of the enemy, which, like lightning, is fallen from heaven and fell out of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> life because its <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> was acquired, and its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> counsels were followed by its change. So when it had fallen away from the Unity and had cast from it its angelic dignity, it was named after its character <q>Devil,</q>  its former and blessed condition being extinct and this hostile power being kindled.</p>

<p>Furthermore if he calls the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> a creature he describes His nature as limited. How then can the two following passages stand? <q>The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> fills the world;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321848"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse7">Wisdom&nbsp;1:7</a></span> and <q>Whither shall I go from your Spirit?</q>  But he does not, it would seem, confess Him to be simple in nature; for he describes Him as one in number. And, as I have already said, everything that is one in number is not simple. And if the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not simple, He consists of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> and sanctification, and is therefore composite. But who is mad enough to describe the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> as composite, and not simple, and consubstantial with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>?</p>

<p>11. If we ought to advance our argument yet further, and turn our inspection to higher themes, let us contemplate the divine nature of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> specially from the following point of view. In Scripture we find mention of three creations. The first is the evolution from non-being into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">being</a>.  The second is change from the worse to the better. The third is the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> cooperating with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. There is a bringing into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the heavens; and what says David? <q>By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth.</q>  Again, man is created through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, for <q>if any man be in Christ he is a new creature.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321852"><a href="../bible/2co005.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> And why does the Saviour say to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, <q>Go ye therefore and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a></q>? Here too you see the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> present with the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>. And what would you say also as to the resurrection of the dead when we shall have failed and returned to our dust? Dust we are and unto dust we shall return.  And He will send the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and create us and renew the face of the earth.  For what the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> calls resurrection David describes as renewal. Let us hear, once more, him who was caught into the third heaven. What does he say? <q>You are the temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is in you.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321855"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:19</a></span> Now every temple  is a temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and if we are a temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. It is also called Solomon's temple, but this is in the sense of his being its builder. And if we are a temple of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in this sense, then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for <q>He that built all things is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321857"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;3:4</a></span> If we are a temple of one who is worshipped, and who dwells in us, let us confess Him to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for you shall worship the Lord your <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Him only shall you serve.  Supposing them to object to the word <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> let them learn what this word means. God is called <span class="greek">&#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x1F78;&#x03C2;</span> either because He placed (<span class="greek">&#x03C4;&#x03B5;&#x03B8;&#x03B5;&#x03B9;&#x03BA;&#x1F73;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) all things or because He beholds (<span class="greek">&#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x1FB6;&#x03C3;&#x03B8;&#x03B1;&#x03B9;</span>) all things. If He is called <span class="greek">&#x0398;&#x03B5;&#x1F78;&#x03C2;</span> because He <q>placed</q> or <q>beholds</q> all things, and the Spirit <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> all the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the Spirit in us <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> our things, then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  Again, if the sword of the spirit is the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note321860"><a href="../bible/eph006.htm#verse17">Ephesians&nbsp;6:17</a></span> then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, inasmuch as the sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called the word. Is He named the right hand of the Father? For <q>the right hand of the Lord brings mighty things to pass;</q>  and <q>your right hand, O Lord, has dashed in pieces the enemy.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321862"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse6">Exodus&nbsp;15:6</a></span> But the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is the finger of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as it is said <q>if I by the finger of God cast out devils,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321863"><a href="../bible/luk011.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;11:20</a></span> of which the version in another <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> is <q>if I by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> cast out devils.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note321864"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;12:28</a></span> So the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> is of the same nature as the Father and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>.</p>

<p>12. So much must suffice for the present on the subject of the adorable and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Trinity. It is not now possible to extend the enquiry about it further. Do ye take seeds from a <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> person like me, and cultivate the ripe ear for yourselves, for, as you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, in such cases we look for interest. But I trust in God that you, because of your pure lives, will bring forth fruit thirty, sixty, and a hundred fold. For, it is said, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. <span class="stiki" id="note321865"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;5:8</a></span> And, my brethren, entertain no other conception of the kingdom of the heavens than that it is the very <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of realities. This the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a> call blessedness. For <q>the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is within you.</q> </p>

<p>The inner man consists of nothing but <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. The kingdom of the heavens, then, must be <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a>. Now we behold their shadows as in a glass; hereafter, set free from this earthly body, clad in the incorruptible and the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, we shall behold their archetypes, we shall see them, that is, if we have steered our own life's course aright, and if we have heeded the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">right faith</a>, for otherwise none shall see the Lord. For, it is said, into a malicious <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> Wisdom shall not enter, nor dwell in the body that is subject unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note321867"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse4">Wisdom&nbsp;1:4</a></span> And let no one urge in objection that, while I am ignoring what is before our eyes, I am <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophizing</a> to them about bodiless and immaterial being. It seems to me perfectly absurd, while the senses are allowed free action in relation to their proper matter, to exclude mind alone from its peculiar operation. Precisely in the same manner in which sense touches sensible objects, so mind apprehends the objects of mental perception. This too must be said that God our Creator has not included natural faculties among things which can be taught. No one teaches sight to apprehend colour or form, nor hearing to apprehend sound and speech, nor smell, pleasant and unpleasant scents, nor taste, flavours and savours, nor touch, soft and hard, hot and cold. Nor would any one teach the mind to reach objects of mental perception; and just as the senses in the case of their being in any way diseased, or injured, require only proper treatment and then readily fulfil their own functions; just so the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, imprisoned in flesh, and full of the thoughts that arise thence, requires <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and right conversation which make <q>its feet like hinds' feet, and set it on its high places.</q>  The same advice is given us by Solomon the wise, who in one passage offers us the example of the diligent worker the ant,  and recommends her active life; and in another the work of the wise bee in forming its cells,  and thereby suggests a natural <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> wherein also the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is contained, if at least the Creator is considered in proportion to the beauty of the things created.</p>

<p>But with thanks to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the Son and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> let me make an end to my letter, for, as the proverb has it, <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x1FB6;&#x03BD; &#x03BC;&#x1F73;&#x03C4;&#x03C1;&#x03BF;&#x03BD; &#x1F04;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;&#x03C3;&#x03C4;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;</span> . </p>
