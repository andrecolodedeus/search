<h1>Letter 90</h1>

<p><strong>From Theophilus to Epiphanius</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">Theophilus writes to Epiphanius to convoke a council in <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a> for the condemnation of Origenism and asks him to transmit to Constantinople by a trustworthy messenger a copy of its decrees together with the synodical letter of Theophilus himself. His anxiety about this last point is caused by the news that certain of the <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a> <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> have set sail for Constantinople to lay their case before the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, John Chrysostom. The date of the letter is 400 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>Theophilus to his well-beloved lord, brother, and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Epiphanius.</p>

<p>The Lord has said to his <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <q>See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and...to build and to plant.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302627"><a href="../bible/jer001.htm#verse10">Jeremiah&nbsp;1:10</a></span> In every age he bestows the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> upon his church, that His Body <span class="stiki" id="note302628"><a href="../bible/eph001.htm#verse23">Ephesians&nbsp;1:23</a></span> may be preserved intact and that the poison of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> opinions may nowhere prevail over it. And now also do we see the words fulfilled. For the church of Christ <q>not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302629"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> has with the sword of the gospel cut down the Origenist serpents crawling out of their caves, and has delivered from their deadly contagion the fruitful host of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a> of Nitria. I have compressed a short account of my proceedings (it was all that time would allow) into the general letter  which I have addressed indiscriminately to all. As your excellency has often fought in contests of the kind before me, it is your present duty to strengthen the hands of those who are in the field and to gather together to this end the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of your entire island.  A synodical letter should be sent to myself and the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Constantinople  and to any others whom you think fit; that by universal consent <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> himself may be expressly condemned and also the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of which he was the author. I have learned that certain <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniators</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, named Ammonius, Eusebius, and Euthymius, filled with a fresh access of enthusiasm in behalf of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, have taken ship for Constantinople, to ensnare with their deceits as many new converts as they can and to confer anew with the old companions of their impiety. Let it be your care, therefore, to set forth the course of the matter to all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> throughout Isauria and Pamphylia and the rest of the neighbouring provinces: moreover, if you think fit, you can add my letter, so that all of us gathered together in one spirit with the power of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> may deliver these men unto <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> for the destruction of the impiety which possesses them. <span class="stiki" id="note302633"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:4-5</a></span> And to ensure the speedy arrival of my dispatches at Constantinople, send a diligent messenger, one of the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> (as I send fathers from the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Nitria with others also of the <a href="../cathen/10487b.htm">monks</a>, learned men and continent) that when they arrive they may be able themselves to relate what has been done. Above all I beg of you to offer up earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to the Lord that we may be able in this contest also to gain the victory; for no small <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> has filled the hearts of the people both in <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandria</a> and throughout all <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, because a few men have been expelled from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that the body of it might be kept pure. Salute the brothers who are with you. The people  with us salute you in the Lord.</p>
