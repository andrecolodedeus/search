<h1>Letter 91</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Valerianus, Bishop of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a></em>. </p>

<p>Thanks be to the Lord, Who has permitted me to see in your unstained life the fruit of primitive <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Far apart as you are in body, you have united yourself to me by writing; you have embraced me with spiritual and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> longing; you have implanted unspeakable affection in my <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. Now I have realized the force of the proverb, <q>As cold water is to a thirsty <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> news from a far country.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note322307"><a href="../bible/pro005.htm#verse25">Proverbs&nbsp;5:25</a></span> Honoured brother, I really hunger for affection. The <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is not far to seek, for iniquity is multiplied and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of many has grown cold.  For this reason your letter is precious to me, and I am replying by our reverend brother Sabinus. By him I make myself <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to you, and beseech you to be watchful in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on our behalf, that God may one day grant calm and quiet to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> here, and rebuke this wind and sea, that so we may be freed from the storm and agitation in which we are now every moment expecting to be submerged. But in these our troubles one great boon has God given us in hearing that you are in exact agreement and unity with one another, and that the doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion are preached among you without let or hindrance. For at some time or other, unless the period of this world is not already concluded, and if there yet remain days of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, it must needs be that by your means the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> must be renewed in the East and that in due season you recompense her for the blessings which she has given you. The sound part among us here, which preserves the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion of the Fathers, is sore stricken, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> in his wiliness has shattered it by many and various subtle assaults. But, by the help of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of you who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the Lord, may the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and deceitful <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01707c.htm">Arian</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> be quenched; may the good teaching of the Fathers, who met at Nic&aelig;a, shine forth; so that the ascription of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> may be rendered to the blessed Trinity in the terms of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>
