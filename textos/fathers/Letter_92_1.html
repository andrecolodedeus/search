<h1>Letter 92</h1>

<p><strong>The Synodical Letter of Theophilus to the Bishops of Palestine and of Cyprus</strong></p>

<div class="stiki">
<p>The synodical letter of the council held at Alexandria in 400 A.D. to condemn Origenism. Written originally in Greek it was translated into Latin by Jerome.</p>
</div>

<p>This letter has been sent in identical terms to the Bishops of Palestine and to those of <a href="../cathen/04589a.htm">Cyprus</a>. We reproduce the headings of both copies. That to the Bishops of Palestine commences thus: To the well-beloved lords, brothers, and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Eulogius, John, Zebianus, Auxentius, Dionysius, Gennadius, Zeno, Theodosius, Dicterius, Porphyry, Saturninus, Alan, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Ammonius, Helianus, Eusebius, the other <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and to all the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> gathered together at the dedication festival of &AElig;lid,  Theophilus [sends] greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>The Cyprians he addresses thus: To the well-beloved lords, brothers, and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Epiphanius, Marcianus, Agapetus, Boethius, Helpidius, Entasius, Norbanus, Macedonius. Aristo, Zeno, Asiaticus, Heraclides, the other Zeno, Cyriacus, and Aphroditus, Theophilus [sends] greeting in the Lord.</p>

<p>The scope of the letter follows.</p>

<p>We have personally visited the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monasteries</a> of Nitria and find that the Origenistic <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> has made great ravages among them. It is accompanied by a strange fanaticism: men even maim themselves or cut out their tongues  to show how they despise the body. I find that some men of this kind have gone from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> into <a href="../cathen/14399a.htm">Syria</a> and other countries  where they speak against us and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<p>The books of <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> have been read before a council of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and unanimously condemned. The following are his chief <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, mainly found in the <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x1F76; &#x1FBF;&#x0391;&#x03C1;&#x03C7;&#x1FF6;&#x03BD;</span> .</p>

<p>1. The Son compared with us is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but compared with the Father he is <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<p>2. Christ's kingdom will one day come to an end.</p>

<p>3. We ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to the Father alone, not to the Son.</p>

<p>4. Our bodies after the resurrection will be corruptible and mortal.</p>

<p>5. There is nothing perfect even in heaven; the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> themselves are faulty, and some of them feed on the Jewish <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.</p>

<p>6. The stars are conscious of their own movements, and the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the future by their courses.</p>

<p>7. Magic, if real, is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<p>8. Christ suffered once for men; he will suffer again for the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</p>

<p>The Origenists have tried to coerce me; they have even stirred up the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> by denouncing the destruction of the Serapeum; and have sought to withdraw from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> jurisdiction two <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> accused of grave crimes. One of these is the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>  who was wrongly placed on the list of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> by Isidore, the other Isidore himself. He is the standard-bearer of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> faction, and his <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> supplies them with unbounded resources for their violent enterprises. They have tried to <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> me; they seized the <a href="../cathen/04340c.htm">monastery</a> church at Nitria, and for a time prevented the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> from entering and the offices from being performed. Now, like Zebul (<a href="../cathen/02388c.htm">Beelzebub</a>) they go to and fro on the earth.</p>

<p>I have done them no harm; I have even protected them. But I would not let an old friendship (with Isidore) impair our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and discipline. I implore you to oppose them wherever they come, and to prevent them from unsettling the brethren committed to you.</p>
