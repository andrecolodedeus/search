<h1>Letter 92</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p>To the Italians and Gauls.</p>

<p>1. To our right godly and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren who are ministering in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> and <a href="../cathen/06395b.htm">Gaul</a>, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of like mind with us, we, Meletius,  Eusebius,  Basil,  Bassus,  Gregory,  Pelagius,  <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, Anthimus,  Theodotus,  Bithus,  Abraamius,  Jobinus, Zeno,  Theodoretus, Marcianus, Barachus, Abraamius,  Libanius, Thalassius, Joseph, Boethus, Iatrius,  Theodotus, Eustathius,  Barsumas, John, Chosroes, Iosaces,  Narses, Maris, Gregory,  and Daphnus, send greeting in the Lord. Souls in anguish find some consolation in sending sigh after sigh from the bottom of the heart, and even a tear shed breaks the force of affliction. But sighs and tears give us less consolation than the opportunity of telling our troubles to your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. We are moreover cheered by the better hope that, perhaps, if we announce our troubles to you, we may move you to give us that succour which we have long hoped you would give the Churches in the East, but which we have not yet received; <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Who in His wisdom arranges all things, must have ordained according to the hidden judgments of His righteousness, that we should be tried for a longer time in these <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>. The fame of our condition has travelled to the ends of the earth, and you are not <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it; nor are you without sympathy with brethren of like mind with yourselves, for you are <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> of the apostle, who teaches us that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for our neighbour is the fulfilling of the law.  But, as we have said, the just judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which has ordained that the affliction due to our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> must be fulfilled, has held you back. But when you have learned all, specially what has not hitherto reached your ears, from our reverend brother the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Sabinus, who will be able to narrate in person what is omitted in our letter, we do beseech you to be roused both to <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and sympathy for us. We implore you to put on bowels of mercy, to lay aside all hesitation, and to undertake the labour of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, without counting length of way, your own occupations, or any other <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> interests.</p>

<p>2. It is not only one Church which is in peril, nor yet two or three which have fallen under this terrible storm. The mischief of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> spreads almost from the borders of <a href="../cathen/07663a.htm">Illyricum</a> to the Thebaid. Its bad seeds were first sown by the <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamous</a> <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>; they then took deep root through the labours of many who vigorously cultivated the impiety between his time and ours. Now they have produced their deadly fruit. The doctrines of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> religion are overthrown. The <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are in confusion. The ambition of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, who have no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, rushes into high posts, and exalted office is now publicly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> as the prize of impiety. The result is, that the worse a man blasphemes, the fitter the people think him to be a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Clerical dignity is a thing of the past. There is a complete lack of men shepherding the Lord's flock with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>. Ambitious men are constantly throwing away the provision for the poor on their own enjoyment and the distribution of gifts. There is no precise <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of canons. There is complete immunity in sinning; for when men have been placed in office by the favour of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to return the favour by continually showing indulgence to offenders. Just judgment is a thing of the past; and everyone walks according to his heart's desire. Vice <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> no bounds; the people <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> no restraint. Men in authority are afraid to speak, for those who have reached power by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> interest are the slaves of those to whom they owe their advancement. And now the very vindication of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a> is looked upon in some quarters as an opportunity for mutual attack; and men conceal their private ill-will and pretend that their hostility is all for the sake of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Others, afraid of being convicted of disgraceful crimes, madden the people into fratricidal quarrels, that their own doings may be unnoticed in the general distress. Hence the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> admits of no truce, for the doers of ill <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are afraid of a peace, as being likely to lift the veil from their secret <a href="../cathen/08001a.htm">infamy</a>. All the while unbelievers laugh; men of weak <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> are shaken; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is uncertain; <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> are drenched in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, because adulterators of the word imitate the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. The mouths of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> are dumb, while every <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> tongue wags free; <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things are trodden under foot; the better <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a> shun the churches as schools of impiety; and lift their hands in the deserts with sighs and tears to their Lord in heaven. Even you must have heard what is going on in most of our cities, how our people with wives and children and even our old men stream out before the walls, and offer their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in the open air, putting up with all the inconvenience of the weather with great patience, and waiting for help from the Lord.</p>

<p>3. What lamentation can match these woes? What springs of tears are sufficient for them? While, then, some men do seem to stand, while yet a trace of the old state of things is left, before utter shipwreck comes upon the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, hasten to us, hasten to us now, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> brothers, we implore you; on our knees we implore you, hold out a helping hand. May your brotherly bowels be moved toward us; may tears of sympathy flow; do not see, unmoved, half the empire swallowed up by <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; do not let the light of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> be put out in the place where it shone first.</p>

<p>By what action you can then help matters, and how you are to show sympathy for the afflicted, you do not want to be told by us; the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> will suggest to you. But unquestionably, if the survivors are to be saved, there is need of prompt action, and of the arrival of a considerable number of brethren, that those who visit us may complete the number of the synod, in order that they may have weight in effecting a reform, not merely from the dignity of those whose emissaries they are, but also from their own number: thus they will restore the creed drawn up by our fathers at Nic&aelig;a, proscribe the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and, by bringing into agreement all who are of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, speak peace to the Churches. For the saddest thing about it all is that the sound part is divided against itself, and the troubles we are suffering are like those which once befell Jerusalem when <a href="../cathen/15379a.htm">Vespasian</a> was besieging it. The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of that time were at once beset by foes without and consumed by the internal sedition of their own people. In our case, too, in addition to the open attack of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, the Churches are reduced to utter helplessness by the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> raging among those who are supposed to be <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a>. For all these reasons we do indeed desire your help, that, for the future all who confess the apostolic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> may put an end to the schisms which they have unhappily devised, and be reduced for the future to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; that so, once more, the body of Christ may be complete, restored to integrity with all its members. Thus we shall not only praise the blessings of others, which is all we can do now, but see our own Churches once more restored to their pristine boast of <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodoxy</a>. For, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, the boon given you by the Lord is fit subject for the highest congratulation, your power of discernment between the spurious and the genuine and pure, and your preaching the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Fathers without any dissimulation. That <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we have received; that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is stamped with the marks of the Apostles; to that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we assent, as well as to all that was canonically and lawfully promulgated in the Synodical Letter. </p>
