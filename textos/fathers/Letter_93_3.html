<h1>Letter 93</h1>

<p> <em>To the Synod of Chalcedon.</em></p>

<h2>I. He excuses his absence from the Synod, and introduces his representatives.</h2>

<p>Leo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>, to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Synod, assembled at Nic&aelig;a. </p>

<p>I had indeed <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a>, dearly beloved, on behalf of my dear colleagues that all the Lord's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> would persist in united devotion to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, and that no one would be misled by favour or <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of secular powers into departure from the way of Truth; but because many things often occur to produce penitence and God's mercy transcends the faults of delinquents, and vengeance is postponed in order that reformation may have place, we must make much of our most merciful prince's piously intentioned Council, in which he has desired your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brotherhood to assemble for the purpose of destroying the snares of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and restoring the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so far respecting the rights and dignity of the most blessed Apostle Peter as to invite us too by letter to vouchsafe our presence at your venerable Synod. That indeed is not permitted either by the needs of the times or by any precedent. Yet in these brethren, that is Paschasinus and Lucentius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, Boniface and Basil, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, who have been deputed by the <a href="../cathen/01640c.htm">Apostolic See</a>, let your brotherhood reckon that I am presiding  at the Synod; for my presence is not withdrawn from you, who am now represented by my vicars, and have this long time been really with you in the proclaiming of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith: so that you who cannot help <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> what we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in accordance with ancient tradition, cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> what we desire.</p>

<h2>II. He entreats them to re-State the Faith as laid down in the Tome.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, brethren most dear, let all attempts at impugning the Divinely-inspired Faith be entirely put down, and the vain unbelief of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> be laid to rest: and let not that be defended which may not be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>: since in accordance with the authoritative statements of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in accordance with the utterances of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and the teaching of the Apostles, with the greatest fullness and clearness in the letter which we sent to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Flavian of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> memory, it has been laid down what is the loyal and pure confession upon the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ's</a> Incarnation.</p>

<h2>III. The ejected bishops must be restored, and the Nestorian canons retain their force.</h2>

<p>But because we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> full well that through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> jealousies the state of many churches has been disturbed, and a large number of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> have been driven from their Sees for not receiving the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and conveyed into exile, while others have been put into their places though yet alive, to these wounds first of all must the healing of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> be applied, nor must any one be deprived of his own possession that some one else may enjoy it: for if, as we desire, all forsake their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, no one need lose his present rank, and those who have laboured for the Faith ought to have their rights restored with every privilege. Let the decrees specially directed against <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorius</a> of the former Synod of Ephesus, at which <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Cyril of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> memory presided, still retain their force, lest the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> then condemned flatter itself in anything because Eutyches is visited with condign execration. For the purity of the Faith and doctrine which we proclaim in the same spirit as our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Fathers, equally condemns and impugns the <a href="../cathen/10755a.htm">Nestorian</a> and the Eutychian misbelief with its supporters. Farewell in the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord</a>, brethren most dear. Dated 26th  of June, in the consulship of the illustrious Adelfius (451).</p>
