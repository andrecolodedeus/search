<h1>Letter 95</h1>

<p><strong>From Pope Anastasius to Simplicianus</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">At the request of Theophilus Anastasius, <a href="../cathen/12260a.htm">bishop of Rome</a>, writes to Simplicianus, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Milan, to inform him that he, like Theophilus, has condemned <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> whose <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a> have been brought under his notice by Eusebius of Cremona. This latter had shown him a copy of the version by Rufinus of the treatise <em>On First Principles</em>. The date of the letter is 400 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>To his lord and brother Simplicianus, Anastasius.</p>

<p>1. It is felt right that a shepherd should bestow great care and watchfulness upon his flock. In like manner too from his lofty tower the careful watchman keeps a lookout day and night on behalf of the city. So also in the hour of tempest when the sea is dangerous the shipmaster suffers keen anxiety  lest the gale and the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the waves shall dash his vessel upon the rocks. It is with similar feelings that the reverend and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> Theophilus our brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, ceases not to watch over the things that make for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that God's people in the different churches may not by reading <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> run into awful <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>.</p>

<p>2. Being informed, then, by a letter of the aforesaid <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, we inform your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> that we in like manner who are set in the city of <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a> in which the prince of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Peter, first founded the church and then by his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> strengthened it; to the end that no man may contrary to the commandment read these books which we have mentioned, have condemned the same; and have with earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> urged the strict observance of the precepts which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ have inspired the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> to teach. We have charged men to remember the words of the venerable <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, prophetic and full of warning:&mdash; <q>if any than preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302643"><a href="../bible/gal001.htm#verse8">Galatians&nbsp;1:8</a></span> Holding fast, therefore, this precept, we have intimated that everything written in days gone by <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> that is contrary to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is even by us rejected and condemned.</p>

<p>3. I send this letter to your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> by the hand of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> Eusebius,  a man filled with a glowing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for the Lord. He has shown to me some <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> chapters which made me shudder as I passed judgement on them. If <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> has put forth any other writings, you are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they and their author are alike condemned by me. The Lord have you in safe keeping, my lord and brother deservedly held in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>.</p>
