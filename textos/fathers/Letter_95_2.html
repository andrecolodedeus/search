<h1>Letter 95</h1>

<p><strong> <em>ST. BASIL OF CAESAREA</em></strong>

<p> <em>To Eusebius, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Samosata</em>.</p>

<p>I had written some while since to your reverence about our meeting one another and other subjects, but I was disappointed at my letter not reaching your excellency, for after the blessed <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> Theophrastus had taken charge of the letter, on my setting out on an unavoidable journey, he did not convey it to your reverence, because he was seized by the sickness of which he died. Hence it happened that I was so late in writing, that, the time being now so exceedingly short, I did not look for there being much use in this letter. The godly <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Meletius and Theodotus had strongly urged me to visit them, representing that a meeting would be a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of affection, and being wishful of remedying the troubles which are at present a <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of anxiety.  They had appointed, as a time for our meeting, the middle of the approaching month of June, and for the place, Phargamus, a spot famous for <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr's</a> <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and for the large number of people attending the synod there every year. Directly I returned and heard of the death of the blessed <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a>, and that my letter was lying useless at home, I felt that I must not be idle, because thirty-three days were still remaining up to the appointed time, and so I hurriedly sent the letter to the very reverend Eustathius, my fellow minister, with the object of its being sent on by him to your reverence and of getting an answer without delay. If, then, it is possible and agreeable to you to come, I will come too. If not, I, God willing, will pay the debt of meeting due from last year: unless haply some hindrance for my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> comes in the way again, in which case I must put off my meeting with the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> to another time.</p>
