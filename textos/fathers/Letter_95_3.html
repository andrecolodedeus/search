<h1>Letter 95</h1>

<p> <em>To Pulcheria Augusta by the Hand of Theoctistus the Magistrian. </em></p>

<h2>I. He informs the Empress that he has loyally recognized the Council ordered by her, and sent representatives with letters to it.</h2>

<p>Leo, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> to Pulcheria Augusta.</p>

<p>Your clemency's religious care which you unceasingly bestow on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith, I recognize in everything, and give God thanks at seeing you take such interest in the universal Church, that I can confidently suggest what I think agreeable to <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and kindness, and so what thus far your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> through the mercy of Christ has irreproachably accomplished, may the more speedily be brought to an issue which we shall be thankful for, O most noble Augusta. Your clemency's command, therefore, that a Synod should be held at Nic&aelig;a , and your gently expressed refusal of my request that it should be held in <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>, so that all the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in our parts might be summoned and assemble, if the state of affairs had permitted them, I have received in a spirit so far removed from scorn as to nominate two of my fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> respectively to represent me, sending also to the venerable synod an appropriate missive from which the brotherhood therein assembled might learn the standard necessary to be maintained in their decision, lest any rashness should do detriment either to the rules of the Faith, or to the provisions of the canons, or to the remedies required by the spirit of loving kindness.</p>

<h2>II. In the settlement of this matter that moderation must be observed which was entirely absent at Ephesus.</h2>

<p>For, as I have very often stated in letters from the beginning of this matter, I have desired that such moderation should be observed in the midst of discordant views and carnal jealousies that, while nothing should be allowed to be wrested from or added to the purity of the Faith, yet the remedy of pardon should be granted to those who return to unity and peace. Because the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> are then more effectually destroyed when men's hearts are recalled to the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and their neighbours. But how contrary to my warnings and entreaties were their actions then, it is a long story to explain, nor is the need to put down in the pages of a letter all that was allowed to be perpetrated in that meeting, not of judges but of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, at Ephesus; where the chief men of the synod spared neither those brethren who opposed them nor those who assented to them, seeing that for the breaking down of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Faith and the strengthening of execrable <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, they stripped some of their rightful rank and tainted others with complicity in guilt; and surely their cruelty was worse to those whom by persuasion they <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorced</a> from innocence, than to those whom by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> they made blessed confessors.</p>

<h2>III. Those who recant their error must be treated with forbearance.</h2>

<p>And yet because such men have harmed themselves most by their wrong-doing, and because the greater the wounds, the more careful must be the application of the remedy, I have never in any letter maintained that pardon must be withheld even from them if they came to their right mind. And although we unchangeably abhor their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, which is the greatest enemy of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, yet the men themselves, if they without any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> amend their ways and clear themselves by full assurances of repentance, we do not judge to be outcasts from the unspeakable mercy of God: but rather we lament with those that lament, <q>we weep with those that weep <span class="stiki" id="note360432"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;12:15</a></span>,</q> and <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the requirements of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> in deposing without neglecting the remedies of loving-kindness: and this, as your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, is not a mere word-promise, but is also borne out by our actions, inasmuch as nearly all who had been either misled or forced into assenting to the presiding <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, by rescinding what they had decreed and by condemning what they had written, have obtained complete acquittal from guilt and the boon of Apostolic peace.</p>

<h2>IV. Even the authors of the mischief may find room for forgiveness by repentance.</h2>

<p>If, therefore, your clemency deigns to reflect upon my motives, it will be satisfied that I have acted throughout with the design of bringing about the abolition of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> without the loss of one <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; and that in the case of the authors of these cruel disturbances I have modified my practice somewhat in order that their slow minds might be aroused by some feelings of compunction to ask for lenient treatment. For although since their decision, which is no less <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> than <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, they cannot be held in such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> brotherhood as they once were, yet they still retain their sees and their rank as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with the prospect either of receiving the peace of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, after <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and necessary signs of repentance or, if (which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid) they persist in their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, of reaping the reward of their misbelief. Dated 20th of July, in the consulship of the illustrious Adelfius (451).</p>
