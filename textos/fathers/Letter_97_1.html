<h1>Letter 97</h1>

<p><strong>To Pammachius and Marcella</strong></p>

<p> <span class="stiki">With this letter Jerome sends to Pammachius and Marcella a translation of the paschal letter issued by Theophilus for the year 402 A.D. together with the Greek original. He takes the precaution of sending this latter because in the preceding year complaints have been made that his translation was not accurate. Written in 402 A.D.</span> </p>

<p>1. Once more with the return of spring I enrich you with the wares of the east and send the treasures of Alexandria to <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>: as it is written, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> shall come from the south and the Holy One from Mount Paran, even a thick shadow.</q>  (Hence in the Song of Songs the joyous cry of the bride: <q>I sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302646"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse3">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:3</a></span>) Now <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> is Isaiah's <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> fulfilled: <q>In that day shall there be an altar to the Lord in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302647"><a href="../bible/isa019.htm#verse19">Isaiah&nbsp;19:19</a></span> <q>Where <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> has abounded, <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> does much more abound.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note302648"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse20">Romans&nbsp;5:20</a></span> They who fostered the infant Christ now with glowing <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> defend Him in His manhood; and they who once saved Him from the hands of <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> are ready to save Him again from this blasphemer and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. Demetrius expelled <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> from the city of Alexander; but he is now thanks to Theophilus outlawed from the whole world. Like him to whom Luke has dedicated the <em>Acts of the Apostles <span class="stiki" id="note302649"><a href="../bible/act001.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;1:1</a></span> </em> this <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> derives his name from his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Where now is the wriggling serpent?  In what plight does the venomous viper find himself? His is</p>

<blockquote><p>A <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> face with wolfish body joined. </p></blockquote>

<p>Where now is that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> which crawled hissing through the world and boasted that both the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> Theophilus and I were partisans of its <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>? Where now is the yelping of those shameless hounds who, to win over the simple minded, <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> proclaimed our adherence to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? Crushed by the authority and eloquence of Theophilus they are now like demon-spirits only able to mutter and that from out of the earth. <span class="stiki" id="note302652"><a href="../bible/1sa028.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;28:13</a></span> For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing of Him who, as He comes from above, <span class="stiki" id="note302653"><a href="../bible/joh008.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;8:23</a></span> speaks only of the things that are above.</p>

<p>2. Would that this generation of vipers <span class="stiki" id="note302654"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;3:7</a></span> would either honestly accept our doctrines, or else consistently defend its own; that we might <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whom we are to esteem and whom we are to shun. As it is they have invented a new kind of penitence, hating us as enemies though they dare not deny our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. What, I ask, is this chagrin of theirs which neither time nor reason seems able to cure? When swords flash in battle and men fall and blood flows in streams, hostile hands are often clasped in amity and the fury of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> is exchanged for an unexpected peace. The partisans of this <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> alone can make no terms with churchmen; for they repudiate mentally the verbal assent that is extorted from them. When their open <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> is made plain to the public ear, and when they perceive their hearers clamouring against them; then they assume an air of simplicity, declaring that they hear such doctrines for the first time and that they have no previous <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of them as taught by their master. And when you hold their writings in your hand, they deny with their lips what their hands have written. Why, sirs, need you beset the Propontis,  shift your abode, wander through different countries, and rend with foaming mouths a distinguished prelate of Christ and his followers? If your recantations are sincere, you should replace your former <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> with an equal <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Why do you patch together from this quarter and from that these rags of cursing? And why do you rail at the lives of men whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you cannot resist? Do you cease to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> because according to you sundry <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> us to be sinners? And does impiety cease to disfigure your lips because you can point to scars on our ears? So long as you have a leopard's spots and an <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopian's</a> skin, <span class="stiki" id="note302656"><a href="../bible/jer013.htm#verse23">Jeremiah&nbsp;13:23</a></span> how can it help your perfidy to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I too am marked by moles? See, Pope Theophilus is freely allowed to prove <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; and the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> do not defend the master's words. They merely pretend that they have been altered by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and tampered with, like the works of many other writers. Thus they seek to maintain his <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> not by their own belief but by other people's <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>. So much I would say against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who in the fury of their <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> hostility to us betray the secret feelings of their minds and prove the incurable nature of the wound that rankles in their breasts.</p>

<p>3. But you are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> and the lights of the senate: accept therefore from me the letter which I append.  This year I send it both in Greek and Latin that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may not again lyingly assert that I have made many changes in and additions to the original. I have laboured hard, I must confess, to preserve the charm of the diction by a like elegance in my version: and keeping within fixed lines and never allowing myself to deviate from these I have done my best to maintain the smooth flow of the writer's eloquence and to render his remarks in the tone in which they are made. Whether I have succeeded in these two objects or not I must leave to your judgement to determine. As for the letter itself you are to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that it is divided into four parts. In the first Theophilus exhorts <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> to celebrate the Lord's passover; in the second he slays Apollinarius; in the third he demolishes <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>; while in the fourth and last he exhorts the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to penitence. If the polemic against <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> should seem to you to be inadequate, you are to remember that Origenism was fully treated in last year's letter;  and that this which I have just translated, as it aims at brevity, was not bound to dwell farther upon the subject. Besides, its terse and clear confession of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> directed against Apollinarius is not lacking in dialectical subtlety. Theophilus first wrests the dagger from his opponent's hand, and then stabs him to the heart.</p>

<p>4. Entreat the Lord, therefore, that a composition which has won favour in Greek may not fail to win it also in Latin, and that what the whole East admires and praises Rome may gladly take to her heart. And may the chair of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a> <a href="../cathen/11744a.htm">Peter</a> by its preaching confirm the preaching of the chair of the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> Mark. Popular rumour, indeed, has it that the blessed pope Anastasius is of like <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> and spirit with Theophilus and that he has pursued the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> even to the dens in which they lurk. Moreover his own letters inform us that he condemns in the West what is already condemned in the East. May he live for many years  so that the reviving sprouts of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> may in course of time by his efforts be made to wither and to die.</p>
