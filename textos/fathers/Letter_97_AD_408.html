<h1>Letter 97 (A.D. 408)</h1>

<p> <em>To Olympius, My Excellent and Justly Distinguished Lord, and My Son Worthy of Much Honour in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, Augustine Sends Greeting in the Lord.</em></p>

<p>1. Although, when we heard recently of your having obtained merited promotion to the highest rank, we felt persuaded, however uncertain we still were in some degree as to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the report, that towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of which we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> a son, there was no other feeling in your mind than that which you have now made patent to us in your letter, nevertheless, having now read that letter in which you have been pleased of your own accord to send to us, when we were full of backwardness and diffidence, a most gracious exhortation to use our <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> efforts in pointing out to you how the Lord, by whose gift you are thus powerful, may from time to time, by means of your <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, bring assistance to His Church, we write to you with the more abundant confidence, my excellent and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> distinguished lord, and my son worthy of much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>2. Many brethren, indeed, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men who are my colleagues, have, by reason of the troubles of the church here, gone&mdash; I might almost say as fugitives&mdash; to the emperor's most illustrious court; and these brethren you may have already seen, or may have received from Rome their letters, in connection with their respective occasions of appeal. I have not had it in my power to consult them before writing; nevertheless, I was unwilling to miss the opportunity of sending a letter by the bearer, my brother and fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, who has been compelled, though in mid-winter, to make the best of his way into those parts, under pressing necessity, in order to save the life of a fellow-citizen. I write, therefore, to salute you, and to charge you by the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which you have in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus our Lord</a>, to see that your good work be hastened on with the utmost diligence, in order that the enemies of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> concerning the demolition of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and the correction of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> which were sent into Africa while Stilicho yet lived, were framed by the desire of our most <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and faithful emperor; for they either cunningly boast, or unwillingly <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that this was done without his <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, or against his will, and thus they render the minds of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> full of seditious <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, and excite them to dangerous and vehement enmity against us.</p>

<p>3. I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that, in submitting this in the way of petition or respectful suggestion to the consideration of your Excellency, I act agreeably to the wishes of all my colleagues throughout Africa; and I think that it is your duty to take measures, as could be easily done, on whatever opportunity may first arise, to make it understood by these vain men (whose <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> we seek, although they resist us), that it was to the care, not of Stilicho, but of the son of Theodosius, that those <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> which have been sent into Africa for the defence of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> owed their promulgation. On account of these things, then, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> whom I have mentioned already, the bearer of this letter, who is from the district of Milevi, was ordered by his <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, the venerable Severus, who joins me in cordial salutations to you, whose <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> we esteem most genuine, to pass through Hippo-regius, where I am; because, when we happened to meet together in time of serious tribulation and distress to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we sought an opportunity of writing to your Highness, but found none. I had indeed already sent one letter in regard to the business of our <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brother and colleague Boniface, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Cataqua; but the heavier calamities destined to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> us greater agitation had not then befallen us, regarding which, and the means whereby something may be done with the best counsel for their prevention or punishment, according to the method of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have sailed hence on that errand will be able more conveniently to confer with you, in whose cordial goodwill towards us we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, inasmuch as they are able to report to you something which has been, so far as limited time permitted, the result of careful and united consultation. But as to this other matter, namely, that the province be made to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how the mind of our most gracious and religious emperor stands towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, I recommend, nay, I beg, beseech, and implore you, to take care that no time be lost, but that its accomplishment be hastened, even before you see the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who have gone from us, so soon as shall be possible for you, in the exercise of your most eminent vigilance on behalf of the members of Christ who are now in circumstances of the utmost danger; for the Lord has provided no small consolation for us under these trials, seeing that it has pleased Him to put much more now than formerly in your power, although we were already filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> by the number and the magnitude of your good offices.</p>

<p>4. We <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> much in the firm and steadfast <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some, and these not few in number, who by means of these <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> have been converted to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, or from <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peace, for whose <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> welfare we are glad to run the risk of forfeiting temporal welfare. For on this account especially we now have to endure at the hands of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, exceedingly and obdurately perverse, more grievous assaults of enmity, which some of them, along with us, bear most patiently; but we are in very great <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> because of their weakness, until they learn, and are enabled by the help of the Lord's most compassionate <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, to despise with more abundant strength of spirit the present world and man's short day. May it please your Highness to deliver the letter of instructions which I have sent to my brethren the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> when they come, if, as I suppose, they have not yet reached you. For we have such confidence in the unfeigned devotion of your heart, that with the Lord's help we desire to have you not only giving us your assistance, but also participating in our consultations.</p>
