<h1>Letter to Africanus</h1>

<p><span class="sc"><a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a></span> to <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a>, a beloved brother in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Child, greeting. Your letter, from which I learn what you think of the Susanna in the Book of Daniel, which is used in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, although apparently somewhat short, presents in its few words many problems, each of which demands no common treatment, but such as oversteps the character of a letter, and reaches the limits of a discourse.  And I, when I consider, as best I can, the measure of my <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a>, that I may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> myself, am aware that I am wanting in the accuracy necessary to reply to your letter; and that the more, that the few days I have spent in <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> have been far from sufficient to send you an answer to all your demands and queries even after the fashion of the present epistle. Wherefore pardon my little ability, and the little time I had, and read this letter with all indulgence, supplying anything I may omit.</p>

<p>2. You begin by saying, that when, in my discussion with our friend Bassus, I used the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> which contains the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Daniel when yet a young man in the affair of Susanna, I did this as if it had escaped me that this part of the book was spurious. You say that you praise this passage as elegantly written, but find fault with it as a more modern composition, and a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>; and you add that the forger has had recourse to something which not even Philistion the play-writer would have used in his puns between <em>prinos</em> and <em>prisein</em>, <em>schinos</em> and <em>schisis</em>, which words as they sound in Greek can be used in this way, but not in Hebrew. In answer to this, I have to tell you what it behooves us to do in the cases not only of the History of Susanna, which is found in every <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> in that Greek copy which the Greeks use, but is not in the Hebrew, or of the two other passages you mention at the end of the book containing the history of Bel and the Dragon, which likewise are not in the Hebrew copy of Daniel; but of thousands of other passages also which I found in many places when with my little strength I was collating the Hebrew copies with ours. For in Daniel itself I found the word <q>bound</q> followed in our versions by very many verses which are not in the Hebrew at all, beginning (according to one of the copies which circulate in the Churches) thus: <q>Ananias, and Azarias, and Misael <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> and sang unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> down to <q>O, all you that worship the Lord, bless the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods. Praise Him, and say that His mercy endures for ever and ever. And it came to pass, when the king heard them singing, and saw them that they were alive.</q> Or, as in another copy, from <q>And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God and blessing the Lord,</q> down to <q>O, all you that worship the Lord, bless the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of gods. Praise Him, and say that His mercy endures to all generations.</q>  But in the Hebrew copies the words, <q>And these three men, Sedrach, Misach, and Abednego fell down bound into the midst of the fire,</q> are immediately followed by the verse, <q>Nabouchodonosor the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said unto his counsellors.</q> For so Aquila, following the Hebrew reading, gives it, who has obtained the credit among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> of having interpreted the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> with no ordinary care, and whose version is most commonly used by those who do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Hebrew, as the one which has been most successful. Of the copies in my possession whose readings I gave, one follows the Seventy, and the other Theodotion; and just as the History of Susanna which you call a <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> is found in both, together with the passages at the end of Daniel, so they give also these passages, amounting, to make a rough guess, to more than two hundred verses.</p>

<p>3. And in many other of the sacred books I found sometimes more in our copies than in the Hebrew, sometimes less. I shall adduce a few examples, since it is impossible to give them all. Of the Book of Esther neither the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of Mardochaios nor that of Esther, both fitted to edify the reader, is found in the Hebrew. Neither are the letters;  nor the one written to Amman about the rooting up of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation, nor that of Mardochaios in the name of Artaxerxes delivering the nation from death. Then in Job, the words from <q>It is written, that he shall rise again with those whom the Lord raises,</q> to the end, are not in the Hebrew, and so not in Aquila's edition; while they are found in the <a href="../cathen/13722a.htm">Septuagint</a> and in Theodotion's version, agreeing with each other at least in sense. And many other places I found in Job where our copies have more than the Hebrew ones, sometimes a little more, and sometimes a great deal more: a little more, as when to the words, <q>Rising up in the morning, he offered burnt-offerings for them according to their number,</q> they add, <q>one heifer for the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>;</q> and to the words, <q>The <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> of God came to present themselves before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> came with them,</q> <q>from going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</q> Again, after <q>The Lord gave, the Lord has taken away,</q> the Hebrew has not, <q>It was so, as seemed <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Lord</a>.</q> Then our copies are very much fuller than the Hebrew, when Job's wife speaks to him, from <q>How long will you hold out? And he said, Lo, I wait yet a little while, looking for the hope of my <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,</q> down to <q>that I may cease from my troubles, and my sorrows which compass me.</q> For they have only these words of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, <q>But say a word against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and die.</q></p>

<p>4. Again, through the whole of Job there are many passages in the Hebrew which are wanting in our copies, generally four or five verses, but sometimes, however, even fourteen, and nineteen, and sixteen. But why should I enumerate all the instances I collected with so much labour, to prove that the difference between our copies and those of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> did not escape me? In Jeremiah I noticed many instances, and indeed in that book I found much transposition and variation in the readings of the prophecies. Again, in Genesis, the words, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> saw that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>,</q> when the firmament was made, are not found in the Hebrew, and there is no small dispute among them about this; and other instances are to be found in Genesis, which I marked, for the sake of distinction, with the sign the Greeks call an obelisk, as on the other hand I marked with an asterisk those passages in our copies which are not found in the Hebrew. What needs there to speak of Exodus, where there is such diversity in what is said about the tabernacle and its court, and the ark, and the garments of the <a href="../cathen/12407b.htm">high priest</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, that sometimes the meaning even does not seem to be akin? And, forsooth, when we notice such things, we are immediately to reject as spurious the copies in use in our Churches, and enjoin the brotherhood to put away the sacred books current among them, and to coax the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, and persuade them to give us copies which shall be untampered with, and free from <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>! Are we to suppose that that Providence which in the sacred Scriptures has ministered to the edification of all the Churches of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, had no thought for those bought with a price, for whom Christ died;  whom, although His Son, God who is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> spared not, but gave Him up for us all, that with Him He might freely give us all things? </p>

<p>5. In all these cases consider whether it would not be well to remember the words, <q>You shall not remove the ancient landmarks which your fathers have set.</q>  Nor do I say this because I shun the labour of investigating the Jewish Scriptures, and comparing them with ours, and noticing their various readings. This, if it be not arrogant to say it, I have already to a great extent done to the best of my ability, labouring hard to get at the meaning in all the editions and various readings;  while I paid particular attention to the interpretation of the Seventy, lest I might to be found to accredit any <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a> to the Churches which are under heaven, and give an occasion to those who seek such a starting-point for gratifying their desire to <a href="../cathen/14035b.htm">slander</a> the common brethren, and to bring some accusation against those who shine forth in our community. And I make it my endeavour not to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of their various readings, lest in my controversies with the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> I should quote to them what is not found in their copies, and that I may make some use of what is found there, even although it should not be in our Scriptures. For if we are so prepared for them in our discussions, they will not, as is their manner, scornfully laugh at Gentile <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> for their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> reading as they have them. So far as to the History of Susanna not being found in the Hebrew.</p>

<p>6. Let us now look at the things you find fault with in the story itself. And here let us begin with what would probably make any one averse to receiving the history: I mean the play of words between <em>prinos</em> and <em>prisis</em>, <em>schinos</em> and <em>schisis</em>. You say that you can see how this can be in Greek, but that in Hebrew the words are altogether distinct. On this point, however, I am still in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>; because, when I was considering this passage (for I myself saw this difficulty), I consulted not a few <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> about it, asking them the Hebrew words for <em>prinos</em> and <em>prisein</em>, and how they would translate <em>schinos</em> the tree, and how <em>schisis</em>. And they said that they did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> these Greek words <em>prinos</em> and <em>schinos</em>, and asked me to show them the trees, that they might see what they called them. And I at once (for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth's</a> dear sake) put before them pieces of the different trees. One of them then said, that he could not with any certainty give the Hebrew name of anything not mentioned in Scripture, since, if one was at a loss, he was prone to use the Syriac word instead of the Hebrew one; and he went on to say, that some words the very wisest could not translate. <q>If, then,</q> said he, <q>you can adduce a passage in any Scripture where the <em>schinos</em> is mentioned, or the <em>prinos</em>, you will find there the words you seek, together with the words which have the same sound; but if it is nowhere mentioned, we also do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it.</q> This, then, being what the Hebrews said to whom I had recourse, and who were acquainted with the history, I am cautious of affirming whether or not there is any correspondence to this play of words in the Hebrew. Your reason for affirming that there is not, you yourself probably <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>.</p>

<p>7. Moreover, I remember hearing from a learned Hebrew, said among themselves to be the son of a wise man, and to have been specially trained to succeed his father, with whom I had intercourse on many subjects, the names of these elders, just as if he did not reject the History of Susanna, as they occur in Jeremias as follows: <q>The Lord make you like Zedekias and Achiab, whom the king of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> roasted in the fire, for the iniquity they did in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>.</q>  How, then, could the one be sawn asunder by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and the other rent in pieces? The answer is, that these things were prophesied not of this world, but of the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, after the departure from this world. For as the lord of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> servant who says, <q>My lord delays his coming,</q> and so gives himself up to <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, eating and drinking with drunkards, and smiting his fellow-servants, shall at his coming <q>cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the unbelievers,</q>  even so the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> appointed to punish will accomplish these things (just as they will cut asunder the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> steward of that passage) on these men, who were called indeed elders, but who administered their stewardship wickedly. One will saw asunder him who was waxen old in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> days, who had pronounced false judgment, condemning the innocent, and letting the guilty go free;  and another will rend in pieces him of the seed of <a href="../cathen/03569b.htm">Chanaan</a>, and not of Judah, whom beauty had deceived, and whose heart <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> had perverted. </p>

<p>8. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> another Hebrew, who told about these elders such traditions as the following: that they pretended to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> in captivity, who were hoping by the coming of Christ to be freed from the yoke of their enemies, that they could explain clearly the things concerning Christ,...and that they so deceived the wives of their countrymen.  Wherefore it is that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Daniel calls the one <q>waxen old in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> days,</q> and says to the other, <q>Thus have you dealt with the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>; but the daughters of Juda would not abide your <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>.</q></p>

<p>9. But probably to this you will say, Why then is the <q>History</q> not in their Daniel, if, as you say, their wise men hand down by tradition such stories? The answer is, that they hid from the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the people as many of the passages which contained any scandal against the elders, rulers, and judges, as they could, some of which have been preserved in uncanonical writings (Apocrypha). As an example, take the story told about Esaias; and guaranteed by the Epistle to the Hebrews, which is found in none of their public books. For the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, in speaking of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and what they suffered, says, <q>They were <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stoned</a>, they were sawn asunder, they were slain with the sword.</q>  To whom, I ask, does the <q>sawn asunder</q> refer (for by an old idiom, not peculiar to Hebrew, but found also in Greek, this is said in the plural, although it refers to but one person)? Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> very well that tradition says that Esaias the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> was sawn asunder; and this is found in some <a href="../cathen/01601a.htm">apocryphal</a> work, which probably the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> have purposely tampered with, introducing some phrases manifestly incorrect, that discredit might be thrown on the whole.</p>

<p>However, some one hard pressed by this argument may have recourse to the opinion of those who reject this Epistle as not being <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a>; against whom I must at some other time use other arguments to prove that it is <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a>.  At present I shall adduce from the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> what <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> testifies concerning the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, together with a story which He refers to, but which is not found in the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a>, since in it also there is a scandal against <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> judges in <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. The words of our Saviour run thus: <q>Woe unto you, <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, hypocrites because you build the tombs of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partaken with them in the blood of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Wherefore be witnesses unto yourselves, that you are the children of them which killed the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. Fill up then the measure of your fathers. You serpents, you generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of Gehenna? Wherefore, behold, I send unto you <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and wise men, and <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a>; and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you scourge in your <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogues</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> them from city to city: that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar. Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.</q> And what follows is of the same tenor: <q>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that killest the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and <a href="../cathen/14308a.htm">stone</a> them which are sent unto you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not! Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.</q> </p>

<p>Let us see now if in these cases we are not forced to the conclusion, that while the Saviour gives a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> account of them, none of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> which could prove what He tells are to be found. For they who build the tombs of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, condemning the crimes their fathers committed against the righteous and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, say, <q>If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q>  In the blood of what <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, can any one tell me? For where do we find anything like this written of Esaias, or Jeremias, or any of the twelve, or Daniel? Then about Zacharias the son of Barachias, who was slain between the temple and the altar, we learn from Jesus only, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> it otherwise from any Scripture. Wherefore I think no other supposition is possible, than that they who had the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> of wisdom, and the rulers and elders, took away from the people every passage which might bring them into discredit among the people. We need not wonder, then, if this history of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> device of the licentious elders against Susanna is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but was concealed and removed from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> by men themselves not very far removed from the counsel of these elders.</p>

<p>In the Acts of the Apostles also, Stephen, in his other testimony, says, <q>Which of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> have not your fathers <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a>? And they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Just One</a>; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers.</q>  That Stephen speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, every one will admit who receives the Acts of the Apostles; but it is impossible to show from the extant books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> how with any <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> he throws the blame of having <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> and slain the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> on the fathers of those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, testifies this concerning the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>: <q>For you, brethren, became followers of the Churches of God which in <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a> are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>; who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, and have <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> us; and they please not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and are contrary to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</q>  What I have said is, I think, sufficient to prove that it would be nothing wonderful if this history were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and the licentious and cruel attack was actually made on Susanna by those who were at that time elders, and written down by the wisdom of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but removed by these rulers of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>,  as the Spirit would call them.</p>

<p>10. Your next objection is, that in this writing Daniel is said to have been seized by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and to have cried out that the sentence was <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>; while in that writing of his which is universally received he is represented as prophesying in quite another manner, by visions and dreams, and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appearing to him, but never by prophetic inspiration. You seem to me to pay too little heed to the words, <q>At sundry times, and in various manners, God spoke in time past unto the fathers by the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>.</q>  This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> not only in the general, but also of individuals. For if you notice, you will find that the same <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> have been favoured with divine dreams and angelic appearances and (direct) inspirations. For the present it will suffice to instance what is testified concerning Jacob. Of dreams from God he speaks thus: <q>And it came to pass, at the time that the cattle conceived, that I saw them before my eyes in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, and, behold, the rams and he-goats which leaped upon the sheep and the goats, white-spotted, and speckled, and grisled. And the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of God spoke unto me in a <a href="../cathen/05154a.htm">dream</a>, saying, Jacob. And I said, What is it? And he said, Lift up your eyes and see, the goats and rams leaping on the goats and sheep, white-spotted, and speckled, and grisled: for I have seen all that Laban does unto you. I am <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who appeared unto you in the place of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, where you anointed to Me there a pillar, and vowed a vow there to Me: now arise, get out from this land, and return unto the land of your kindred.</q> </p>

<p>And as to an appearance (which is better than a dream), he speaks as follows about himself: <q>And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with him until the breaking of the day. And he saw that he prevailed not against him, and he touched the breadth of his thigh; and the breadth of Jacob's thigh grew stiff while he was wrestling with him. And he said to him, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let you go, unless you bless me. And he said unto him, What is your name? And he said, Jacob. And he said to him, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> shall be your name: for you have prevailed with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and art powerful with men. And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me your name. And he said, Why is it that you ask after my name? And he blessed him there. And Jacob called the name of the place Vision of God: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. And the sun rose, when the vision of God passed by.</q>  And that he also prophesied by inspiration, is evident from this passage: <q>And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in the last days. Gather yourselves together, and hear, you sons of Jacob; and hearken unto <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> your father. Reuben, my <a href="../cathen/06081a.htm">first-born</a>, my might, and the beginning of my children, hard to be born, hard and stubborn. You were wanton, boil not over like water; because you went up to your father's bed; then defiled the couch to which you went up.</q>  And so with the rest: it was by inspiration that the prophetic blessings were pronounced. We need not wonder, then, that Daniel sometimes prophesied by inspiration, as when he rebuked the elders sometimes, as you say, by dreams and visions, and at other times by an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appearing unto him.</p>

<p>11. Your other objections are stated, as it appears to me, somewhat irreverently, and without the becoming spirit of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>. I cannot do better than quote your very words: <q>Then, after crying out in this extraordinary fashion, he detects them in a way no less incredible, which not even Philistion the play-writer would have resorted to. For, not satisfied with rebuking them through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he placed them apart, and asked them severally where they saw her committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; and when the one said, 'Under a holm-tree' (<em>prinos</em>) he answered that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would saw him asunder (<em>prisein</em>); and in a similar fashion threatened the other, who said, 'Under a mastich-tree' (<em>schinos</em>), with being rent asunder.</q></p>

<p>You might as reasonably compare to Philistion the play-writer, a story somewhat like this one, which is found in the third book of Kings, which you yourself will admit to be well written. Here is what we read in Kings:&mdash; </p>

<p><q>Then there appeared two <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> that were harlots before the king, and stood before him. And the one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said, To me, my lord, I and this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> dwell in one house; and we were delivered in the house. And it came to pass, the third day after that I was delivered, that this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was delivered also: and we were together; there is no one in our house except us two. And this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> child died in the night; because she overlaid it. And she arose at midnight, and took my son from my arms. And your handmaid slept. And she laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. And I arose in the morning to give my child suck, and he was dead; but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son which I did bear. And the other <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> said, Nay; the dead is your son, but the living is my son. And the other said, No; the living is my son, but the dead is your son. Thus they spoke before the king. Then said the king, You say, This is my son that lives, and your son is the dead: and you say Nay; but your son is the dead, and my son is the living. And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. Then spoke the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whose the living child was unto the king (for her bowels yearned after her son), and she said, To me, my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor yours, but divide it. Then the king answered and said, Give the child to her which said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: for she is the mother of it. And all <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the face of the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.</q> </p>

<p>For if we were at liberty to speak in this scoffing way of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in use in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Churches</a>, we should rather compare this story of the two harlots to the play of Philistion than that of the chaste Susanna. And just as the people would not have been persuaded if Solomon had merely said, <q>Give this one the living child, for she is the mother of it;</q> so Daniel's attack on the elders would not have been sufficient had there not been added the condemnation from their own mouth, when both said that they had seen her lying with the young man under a tree, but did not agree as to what kind of tree it was. And since you have asserted, as if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> for certain, that Daniel in this matter judged by inspiration (which may or may not have been the case), I would have you notice that there seem to me to be some analogies in the story of Daniel to the judgment of Solomon, concerning whom the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> testifies that the people saw that the wisdom of God was in him to do judgment.  This might be said also of Daniel, for it was because wisdom was in him to do judgment that the elders were judged in the manner described.</p>

<p>12. I had nearly forgotten an additional remark I have to make about the <em>prino-prisein</em> and <em>schino-schisein</em> difficulty; that is, that in our Scriptures there are many etymological fancies, so to call them, which in the Hebrew are perfectly suitable, but not in the Greek. It need not surprise us, then, if the translators of the History of Susanna contrived it so that they found out some Greek words, derived from the same root, which either corresponded exactly to the Hebrew form (though this I hardly think possible), or presented some analogy to it. Here is an instance of this in our Scripture. When the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was made by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> from the rib of the man, <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> says, <q>She shall be called <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, because she was taken out of her husband.</q> Now the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> say that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> was called <q> <em>Essa</em>,</q> and that <q>taken</q> is a translation of this word as is evident from <q> <em>chos isouoth essa</em>,</q> which means, <q>I have taken the cup of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>;</q>  and that <q> <em>is</em></q> means <q>man,</q> as we see from <q> <em>Hesre a&iuml;s</em>,</q> which is, <q>Blessed is the man.</q>  According to the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, then, <q> <em>is</em></q> is <q>man,</q> and <q> <em>essa</em>,</q> <q><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>,</q> because she was taken out of her husband (<em>is</em>). It need not then surprise us if some interpreters of the Hebrew <q>Susanna,</q> which had been concealed among them at a very remote date, and had been preserved only by the more learned and honest, should have either given the Hebrew word for word, or hit upon some analogy to the Hebrew forms, that the Greeks might be able to follow them. For in many other passages we can find traces of this kind of contrivance on the part of the translators, which I noticed when I was collating the various editions.</p>

<p>13. You raise another objection, which I give in your own words: <q>Moreover, how is it that they, who were captives among the Chaldeans, lost and won at play, thrown out unburied on the streets, as was prophesied of the former captivity, their sons torn from them to be eunuchs, and their daughters to be concubines, as had been prophesied; how is it that such could pass sentence of death, and that on the wife of their king Joakim, whom the king of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> had made partner of his throne? Then, if it was not this Joakim, but some other from the common people, whence had a captive such a mansion and spacious garden?</q></p>

<p>Where you get your <q>lost and won at play, and thrown out unburied on the streets,</q> I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not, unless it is from Tobias; and Tobias (as also Judith), we ought to notice, the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> do not use. They are not even found in the Hebrew Apocrypha, as I learned from the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves. However, since the Churches use Tobias, you must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that even in the captivity some of the captives were rich and well to do. Tobias himself says, <q>Because I remembered God with all my heart; and the Most High gave me <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and beauty in the eyes of Nemessarus, and I was his purveyor; and I went into Media, and left in trust with Gabael, the brother of Gabrias, at Ragi, a city of Media, ten talents of silver.</q>  And he adds, as if he were a rich man, <q>In the days of Nemessarus I gave many <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> to my brethren. I gave my bread to the hungry, and my clothes to the naked: and if I saw any of my nation dead, and cast outside the walls of Nineve, I buried him; and if king Senachereim had slain any when he came fleeing from <a href="../cathen/08544a.htm">Judea</a>, I buried them privily (for in his <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> he killed many).</q> Think whether this great catalogue of Tobias's good <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> does not betoken great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and much property, especially when he adds, <q>Understanding that I was sought for to be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>, I withdrew myself for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and all my goods were forcibly taken away.</q> </p>

<p>And another captive, Dachiacharus, the son of Ananiel, the brother of Tobias, was set over all the exchequer of the kingdom of king Acherdon; and we read, <q>Now Achiacharus was cup-bearer and keeper of the signet, and steward and overseer of the accounts.</q> </p>

<p>Mardochaios, too, frequented the court of the king, and had such boldness before him, that he was inscribed among the benefactors of Artaxerxes.</p>

<p>Again we read in Esdras, that Neemias, a cup-bearer and eunuch of the king, of Hebrew race, made a request about the rebuilding of the temple, and obtained it; so that it was granted to him, with many more, to return and build the temple again. Why then should we wonder that one Joakim had garden, and house, and property, whether these were very expensive or only moderate, for this is not clearly told us in the writing?</p>

<p>14. But you say, <q>How could they who were in captivity pass sentence of death?</q> asserting, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not on what grounds, that Susanna was the wife of a king, because of the name Joakim. The answer is, that it is no uncommon thing, when great nations become subject, that the king should allow the captives to use their own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and courts of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>. Now, for instance, that the Romans rule, and the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> pay the half-shekel to them, how great power by the concession of C&aelig;sar the ethnarch has; so that we, who have had experience of it, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that he differs in little from a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> king! Private trials are held according to the law, and some are condemned to death. And though there is not full licence for this, still it is not done without the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the ruler, as we learned and were convinced of when we spent much time in the country of that people. And yet the Romans only take account of two tribes, while at that time besides Judah there were the ten tribes of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. Probably the <a href="../cathen/02007c.htm">Assyrians</a> contented themselves with holding them in subjection, and conceded to them their own judicial processes.</p>

<p>15. I find in your letter yet another objection in these words: <q>And add, that among all the many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who had been before, there is no one who has quoted from another word for word. For they had no need to go a-begging for words, since their own were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. But this one, in rebuking one of these men, quotes the words of the Lord, 'The innocent and righteous shall you not slay.'</q> I cannot understand how, with all your exercise in investigating and meditating on the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, you have not noticed that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> continually quote each other almost word for word. For who of all <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the words in Esaias? <q>And in the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, and the house of the Lord on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall come unto it. And many people shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, unto the house of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob; and He will teach us His way, and we will walk in it: for out of Zion shall go forth a law, and a word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they learn <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> any more.</q> </p>

<p>But in Micah we find a parallel passage, which is almost word for word: <q>And in the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall hasten unto it. And many nations shall come, and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Jacob; and they will teach us His way, and we will walk in His paths: for a law shall go forth from Zion, and a word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> any more.</q> </p>

<p>Again, in First Chronicles, the psalm which is put in the hands of Asaph and his brethren to praise the Lord, beginning, <q>Give thanks unto the Lord, call upon His name,</q>  is in the beginning almost identical with <a href="../bible/psa005.htm">Psalm cv.</a>, down to <q>and do my <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> no harm;</q> and after that it is the same as <a href="../bible/psa095.htm">Psalm xcvi</a>., from the beginning of that psalm, which is something like this, <q>Praise the Lord all the earth,</q> down to <q>For He comes to judge the earth.</q> (It would have taken up too much time to quote more fully; so I have given these short references, which are sufficient for the matter before us.) And you will find the law about not bearing a burden on the <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbath day</a> in Jeremias, as well as in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.  And the rules about the passover, and the rules for the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, are not only in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, but also at the end of Ezekiel.  I would have quoted these, and many more, had I not found that from the shortness of my stay in <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a> my time for writing you was already too much restricted.</p>

<p>Your last objection is, that the style is different. This I cannot see.</p>

<p>This, then, is my defence. I might, especially after all these accusations, speak in praise of this history of Susanna, dwelling on it word by word, and expounding the exquisite nature of the thoughts. Such an encomium, perhaps, some of the learned and able students of divine things may at some other time compose. This, however, is my answer to your strokes, as you call them. Would that I could instruct you! But I do not now arrogate that to myself. My lord and dear brother Ambrosius, who has written this at my dictation, and has, in looking over it, corrected as he pleased, salutes you. His faithful spouse, Marcella, and her children, also salute you. Also <a href="../cathen/01514a.htm">Anicetus</a>. Do you salute our dear father Apollinarius, and all our friends.</p>
