<h1>Letter to Gregory</h1>

<p>1. Greeting in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, my most excellent sir, and venerable son Gregory, from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. A natural readiness of comprehension, as you well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, may, if practice be added, contribute somewhat to the contingent end, if I may so call it, of that which any one wishes to practise. Thus, your natural good parts might make of you a finished Roman lawyer or a Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a>, so to speak, of one of the schools in high <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>. But I am anxious that you should devote all the strength of your natural good parts to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> for your end; and in order to this, I wish to ask you to extract from the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the Greeks what may serve as a course of study or a preparation for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and from geometry and astronomy what will serve to explain the sacred Scriptures, in order that all that the sons of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> are wont to say about geometry and music, grammar, rhetoric, and astronomy, as fellow-helpers to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, we may say about <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself, in relation to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.</p>

<p>2. Perhaps something of this kind is shadowed forth in what is written in Exodus from the mouth of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were commanded to ask from their neighbours, and those who dwelt with them, vessels of silver and gold, and raiment, in order that, by spoiling the Egyptians, they might have material for the preparation of the things which pertained to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For from the things which the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> took from the Egyptians the vessels in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> of holies were made&mdash;the ark with its lid, and the Cherubim, and the mercy-seat, and the golden coffer, where was the manna, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels'</a> bread. These things were probably made from the best of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> gold. An inferior kind would be used for the solid golden candlestick near the inner veil, and its branches, and the golden table on which were the pieces of <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">showbread</a>, and the golden censer between them. And if there was a third and fourth quality of gold, from it would be made the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> vessels; and the other things would be made of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> silver. For when the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> dwelt in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, they gained this from their dwelling there, that they had no lack of such precious material for the utensils of the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> raiment were probably made all those things which, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> mentions, needed sewed and embroidered work, sewed with the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the one to the other, that the veils might be made, and the inner and the outer courts. And why should I go on, in this untimely digression, to set forth how useful to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> were the things brought from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, which the Egyptians had not put to a proper use, but which the Hebrews, guided by the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, used for God's service? Now the sacred Scripture is wont to represent as an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> the going down from the land of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, indicating that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> get harm from sojourning among the Egyptians, that is to say, from meddling with the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of this world, after they have subscribed to the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and the Israelitish service of Him. Ader  at least, the Idum&aelig;an; so long as he was in the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, and had not tasted the bread of the Egyptians, made no <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. It was when he fled from the wise Solomon, and went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as it were flying from the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was made a kinsman of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a> by marrying his wife's sister, and begetting a child, who was brought up with the children of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, that he did this. Wherefore, although he did return to the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, he returned only to divide the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to make them say to the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">golden calf</a>, <q>These be your gods, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which brought you up from the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q>  And I may tell you from my experience, that not many take from <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> only the useful, and go away and use it for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while Ader the Idum&aelig;an has many brethren. These are they who, from their Greek studies, produce <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> notions, and set them up, like the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">golden calf</a>, in Bethel, which signifies <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> house.</q> In these words also there seems to me an indication that they have set up their own imaginations in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, where the word of God dwells, which is called in a figure Bethel. The other figure, the word says, was set up in Dan. Now the borders of Dan are the most extreme, and nearest the borders of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, as is clear from what is written in Joshua, the son of Nun. Now some of the devices of these brethren of Ader, as we call them, are also very near the borders of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>.</p>

<p>3. Do you then, my son, diligently apply yourself to the reading of the sacred Scriptures. Apply yourself, I say. For we who read the things of God need much application, lest we should say or think anything too rashly about them. And applying yourself thus to the study of the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with faithful prejudgments such as are well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, knock at its locked door, and it will be opened to you by the porter, of whom Jesus says, <q>To him the porter opens.</q>  And applying yourself thus to the divine study, seek aright, and with unwavering trust in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the meaning of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, which so many have missed. Be not satisfied with knocking and seeking; for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is of all things indispensable to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For to this the Saviour exhorted, and said not only, <q>Knock, and it shall be opened to you; and seek, and you shall find,</q>  but also, <q>Ask, and it shall be given unto you.</q>  My fatherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to you has made me thus bold; but whether my boldness be good, God will <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, and His Christ, and all partakers of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. May you also be a partaker, and be ever increasing your inheritance, that you may say not only, <q>We have become partakers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q>  but also partakers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>
