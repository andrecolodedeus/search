<h1>Letter to Gregory</h1>

<p class="h1a">When and to whom the Learning derived from Philosophy may be of Service for the Exposition of the Holy Scriptures; with a lively Personal Appeal.</p>

<p class="stiki">This letter to Gregory, afterwards <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of C&aelig;sarea, and called Thaumaturgus, was preserved in the Philocalia, or collection of extracts from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen's</a> works drawn up by Gregory of Nyssa and <a href="../cathen/02330b.htm">Basil of C&aelig;sarea</a>. It is printed by Delarue and Lommatzsch in the forefront of their editions of the works. It forms a good preface to the commentaries, as it shows how <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a> considered the study of Scripture to be the highest of all studies, and how he regarded scientific learning, in which he was himself a master, as merely preparatory for this supreme learning. Dr&auml;seke  has shown that it was written about 235, when <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, after having had Gregory as his pupil at C&aelig;sarea for some years, had fled before the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> under Maximinus Thrax to Cappadocia; while Gregory, to judge from the tenor of this Epistle, had gone to <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>. The Panegyric on <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>,  pronounced by Gregory at C&aelig;sarea about 239, when the school had reassembled there after the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>, shows that the master's solicitude for his pupil's <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> advancement was not disappointed.</p>

<h2>1. Gregory is Urged to Apply His Gentile Learning to the Study of Scripture</h2>

<p>All hail to you in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, most excellent and reverend Sir, son Gregory, from <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>. A natural quickness of understanding is fitted, as you are well aware, if it be diligently exercised, to produce a work which may bring its owner so far as is possible, if I may so express myself, to the consummation of the art the which he desires to practise, and your natural aptitude is sufficient to make you a consummate Roman lawyer and a Greek <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosopher</a> too of the most famous schools. But my desire for you has been that you should direct the whole force of your intelligence to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a> as your end, and that in the way of production. And I would wish that you should take with you on the one hand those parts of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the Greeks which are fit, as it were, to serve as general or preparatory studies for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>, and on the other hand so much of Geometry and Astronomy as may be helpful for the interpretation of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>. The children of the <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a> speak of geometry and music and grammar and rhetoric and astronomy as being ancillary to <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>; and in the same way we might speak of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> itself as being ancillary to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christianity</a>.</p>

<h2>2. This Procedure is Typified by the Story of the Spoiling of the Egyptians</h2>

<p>It is something of this sort perhaps that is enigmatically indicated in the directions God is represented in the Book of Exodus  as giving to the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>. They are directed to beg from their neighbours and from those dwelling in their tents vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment; thus they are to spoil the Egyptians, and to obtain materials for making the things they are told to provide in connection with the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For out of the things of which the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> spoiled the Egyptians the furniture of the Holy of Holies was made, the ark with its cover, and the <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and the mercy-seat and the gold jar in which the manna, that bread of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, was stored. These probably were made from the finest of the gold of the Egyptians, and from a second quality, perhaps, the solid golden candlestick which stood near the inner veil, and the lamps on it, and the golden table on which stood the <a href="../cathen/09317b.htm">showbread</a>, and between these two the golden altar of <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>. And if there was gold of a third and of a fourth quality, the <a href="../cathen/01357e.htm">sacred vessels</a> were made of it. And of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> silver, too, other things were made; for it was from their sojourn in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> that the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> derived the great advantage of being supplied with such a quantity of precious materials for the use of the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Out of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> raiment probably were made all those requisites named in Scripture in embroidered work; the embroiderers working  with the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  such garments for such purposes, to produce the hangings and the inner and outer courts. This is not a suitable opportunity to enlarge on such a theme or to show in how many ways the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> found those things useful which they got from the Egyptians. The Egyptians had not made a proper use of them; but the Hebrews used them, for the wisdom of God was with them, for religious purposes. <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, however, that it was an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thing to descend from the land of the children of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>; and in this a great <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is wrapped up. For some it is of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that they should dwell with the Egyptians, that is to say, with the learning of the world, after they have been enrolled in the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and in the Israelite worship of Him. Ader the Edomite,  as long as he was in the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> and did not taste the bread of the Egyptians, made no <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; but when he fled from the wise Solomon and went down into <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, as one who had fled from the wisdom of God he became connected with <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>, marrying the sister of his wife, and begetting a son who was brought up among the sons of <a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh</a>. Therefore, though he did go back to the land of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, he came back to it to bring division into the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them to say to the <a href="../cathen/06628b.htm">golden calf</a>, <q>These are your gods, O <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, which brought you up out of the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>.</q> I have learned by experience and can tell you that there are few who have taken of the useful things of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and come out of it, and have then prepared what is required for the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but Ader the Edomite on the other hand has many a brother. I mean those who, founding on some piece of Greek learning, have brought forth <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> ideas, and have as it were made golden calves in Bethel, which is, being interpreted, the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. This appears to me to be intended to convey that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> set up their own images in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> in which the <a href="../cathen/09328a.htm">Word of God</a> dwells, and which therefore are tropically called Bethel. The other image is said in the word to have been set up in Dan. Now the borders of Dan are at the extremities and are contiguous to the country of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, as is plainly recorded in the Book of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a>, son of Nave. Some of these images, then, are close to the borders of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, which the brothers, as we showed, of Ader have devised.</p>

<h2>3. Personal Appeal</h2>

<p>Do you then, sir, my son, study first of all the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. Study them I say. For we require to study the divine writings deeply, lest we should speak of them faster than we think; and while you study these divine works with a believing and God-pleasing intention, knock at that which is closed in them, and it shall be opened to you by the porter, of whom Jesus says, <span class="stiki" id="note094452"><a href="../bible/joh010.htm#verse3">John&nbsp;10:3</a></span> <q>To him the porter opens.</q> While you attend to this divine reading seek aright and with unwavering <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in God the hidden sense which is present in most passages of the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scriptures</a>. And do not be content with knocking and seeking, for what is most necessary for understanding divine things is <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and in urging us to this the Saviour says not only, <span class="stiki" id="note094453"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse7">Matthew&nbsp;7:7</a></span> <q>Knock, and it shall be opened to you,</q> and <q>Seek, and you shall find,</q> but also <q>Ask, and it shall be given you.</q> So much I have ventured on account of my fatherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to you. Whether I have ventured well or not, God <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and His Christ, and he who has part of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> and the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. May you partake in these; may you have an always increasing share of them, so that you may be able to say not only, <q>We are partakers of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note094454"><a href="../bible/heb003.htm#verse14">Hebrews&nbsp;3:14</a></span> but also <q>We are partakers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>
