<h1>Letter to Origen</h1>

<p><strong>About the History of Susanna.</strong></p>

<p>Greeting, my lord and son, most worthy <a href="../cathen/11306b.htm">Origen</a>, from <a href="../cathen/08565a.htm">Africanus</a>.  In your sacred discussion with Agnomon you referred to that <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of Daniel which is related of his youth. This at that time, as was meet, I accepted as genuine. Now, however, I cannot understand how it escaped you that this part of the book is spurious. For, in truth, this section, although apart from this it is elegantly written, is plainly a more modern <a href="../cathen/06135b.htm">forgery</a>. There are many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of this. When Susanna is condemned to die, the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> is seized by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and cries out that the sentence is <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. Now, in the first place, it is always in some other way that Daniel prophesies&mdash; by visions, and dreams, and an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> appearing to him, never by prophetic inspiration. Then, after crying out in this extraordinary fashion, he detects them in a way no less incredible, which not even Philistion the play-writer would have resorted to. For, not satisfied with rebuking them through the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he placed them apart, and asked them severally where they saw her committing <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. And when the one said, <q>Under a holm-tree</q> (<em><span class="greek">prinos</span> </em>), he answered that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would saw him asunder (<em><span class="greek">prisein</span> </em>); and in a similar fashion menaced the other who said, <q>Under a mastich-tree</q> (<em><span class="greek">schinos</span> </em>), with being rent asunder (<em><span class="greek">schisthenai</span> </em>). Now, in Greek, it happens that <q>holm-tree</q> and <q>saw asunder,</q> and <q>rend</q> and <q>mastich-tree</q> sound alike; but in Hebrew they are quite distinct. But all the books of the <a href="../cathen/14526a.htm">Old Testament</a> have been translated from Hebrew into Greek.</p>

<p>2. Moreover, how is it that they who were captives among the Chald&aelig;ans, lost and won at play,  thrown out unburied on the streets, as was prophesied of the former captivity, their sons torn from them to be eunuchs, and their daughters to be concubines, as had been prophesied; how is it that such could pass sentence of death, and that on the wife of their king Joakim, whom the king of the <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a> had made partner of his throne? Then if it was not this Joakim, but some other from the common people, whence had a captive such a mansion and spacious garden? But a more fatal objection is, that this section, along with the other two at the end of it, is not contained in the Daniel received among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>. And add that, among all the many <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who had been before, there is no one who has quoted from another word for word. For they had no need to go a-begging for words, since their own were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; but this one, in rebuking one of those men, quotes the words of the Lord: <q>The innocent and righteous shall you not slay.</q> From all this I infer that this section is a later addition. Moreover, the style is different. I have struck the blow; do you give the echo; answer, and instruct me. Salute all my masters. The learned all salute you. With all my heart I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for your and your circle's health.</p>
