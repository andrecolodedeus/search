<h1>Letter to a Young Widow</h1>

<p class="stiki">The date of the following letter can be determined within very narrow limits. It contains a reference (c. 5) to the defeat and death of the Emperor Valens in the battle with the Goths at Hadrianople, in A.D. 378, as a recent event. The Emperor who is described as having incessantly engaged in war ever since his accession (c. 4) must be Theodosius, who succeeded Valens, and as the Goths are said to be still overrunning large regions with impunity, and insolently mocking the timidity of the imperial troops (ib.) the letter must have been written prior to the crushing defeat which Theodosius inflicted on them in 382. The whole epistle is deeply tinged with that profound sense of the unhappiness and instability of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life which the moral corruption of society and recent calamities of the empire impressed with peculiar force on the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">minds</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>; producing too often among Pagans either a cynical gloom or reckless indifference, but leading Christians to cling more closely and earnestly to the hopes and consolations of the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>.</p>

<p>1. That you have sustained a severe blow, and that the weapon directed from above has been planted in a vital part all will readily admit, and none even of the most rigid moralists will deny it; but since they who are stricken with sorrow ought not to spend their whole time in mourning and tears, but to make good provision also for the healing of their wounds, lest, if they be neglected their tears should aggravate the wound, and the fire of their sorrow become inflamed, it is a good thing to listen to words of consolation, and restraining for a brief season at least the fountain of your tears to surrender yourself to those who endeavour to console you. On this account I abstained from troubling you when your sorrow was at its height, and the thunderbolt had only just fallen upon you; but having waited an interval and permitted you to take your fill of mourning, now that you are able to look out a little through the mist, and to open your ears to those who attempt to comfort you, I also would second the words of your handmaids by some contributions of my own. For while the tempest is still severe, and a full gale of sorrow is blowing, he who exhorts another to desist from grief would only provoke him to increased lamentations and having incurred his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> would add fuel to the flame by such speeches besides being regarded himself as an unkind and foolish person. But when the troubled water has begun to subside, and God has allayed the fury of the waves, then we may freely spread the sails of our discourse. For in a moderate storm skill may perhaps play its part; but when the onslaught of the wind is irresistible experience is of no avail. For these reasons I have hitherto held my peace, and even now have only just ventured to break silence because I have heard from your uncle that one may begin to take <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, as some of your more esteemed handmaids are now venturing to discourse at length upon these matters, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also outside your own household, who are your kinsfolk, or are otherwise qualified for this office. Now if you allow them to talk to you I have the greatest hope and confidence that you will not disdain my words but do your best to give them a calm and quiet hearing. Under any circumstances indeed the female sex is the more apt to be sensitive to suffering; but when in addition there is youth, and untimely widowhood, and inexperience in business, and a great crowd of cares, while the whole life previously has been nurtured in the midst of luxury, and cheerfulness and <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is increased many fold, and if she who is subjected to it does not obtain help from on high even an accidental thought will be able to unhinge her. Now I hold this to be the foremost and greatest evidence of God's care concerning you; for that you have not been overwhelmed by grief, nor driven out of your natural condition of mind when such great troubles suddenly concurred to afflict you was not due to any <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> assistance but to the almighty hand the understanding of which there is no measure, the wisdom which is past finding out, the <q>Father of mercies and the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all comfort.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190334"><a href="../bible/2co001.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:3</a></span> <q>For He Himself</q> it is said <q>has smitten us, and He will heal us; He will strike, and He will dress the wound and make us whole.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190335"><a href="../bible/hos006.htm#verse2">Hosea&nbsp;6:2</a></span> </p>

<p>For as long as that blessed husband of yours was with you, you enjoyed <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and care and <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> attention; in fact you enjoyed such as you might expect to enjoy from a husband; but since God took him to Himself He has supplied his place to you. And this is not my saying but that of the blessed <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> David for he says <q>He will take up the fatherless and the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>,</q>  and elsewhere he calls Him <q>father of the fatherless and judge of the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>;</q>  thus in many passages you will see that He earnestly considers the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of this class of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.</p>

<p>2. But lest the continual repetition of this name of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> should upset your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and disconcert your reason, having been inflicted on you in the very flower of your age, I wish first of all to discourse on this point, and to prove to you that this name of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> is not a title of calamity but of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, aye the greatest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. For do not quote the erroneous opinion of the world as a testimony, but the admonition of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, or rather of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For in his utterances Christ was speaking through him as he himself said <q>If you seek a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of Christ who is speaking in me?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190338"><a href="../bible/2co013.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> What then does he say? <q>Let not a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> be enrolled under threescore years of age</q> and again <q>but the younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> refuse</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190339"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:9,&nbsp;11</a></span> intending by both these sayings to indicate to us the importance of the matter. And when he is making regulations about <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> he nowhere prescribes a standard of age, but in this case he is very particular on the point, and, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, why so? Not because widowhood is greater than <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, but because <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> have greater labour to undergo than <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, being encompassed on many sides by a variety of business public and private. For as an unfortified city lies exposed to all who wish to plunder it, so a young <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> living in widowhood has many who form designs upon her on every side not only those who aim at getting her money but also those who are bent upon corrupting her modesty. And besides these we shall find that she is subjected to other conditions also likely to occasion her fall. For the contempt of servants their negligence of business, the loss of that respect which was formerly paid, the sight of contemporaries in prosperity, and often the hankering after luxury, induce <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to engage in a second marriage. Some there are who do not choose to unite themselves to men by the law of marriage, but do so secretly and clandestinely. And they act thus in order to enjoy the praise of widowhood; thus it is a state which seems to be not reproached, but admired and deemed worthy of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not only among us who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, but even among unbelievers also. For once when I was still a young man I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the sophist who taught me  (and he exceeded all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> in his reverence for the gods) expressed admiration for my mother before a large company. For enquiring, as was his wont, of those who sat beside him who I was, and some one having said that I was the son of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who was a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, he asked of me the age of my mother and the duration of her widowhood, and when I told him that she was forty years of age of which twenty had elapsed since she lost my father he was astonished and uttered a loud exclamation, and turning to those present <q>Heavens!</q> cried he <q>what <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> there are among the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>.</q> So great is the admiration and praise enjoyed by widowhood not only among ourselves, but also a among those who are outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And being aware of all this the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> said <q>Let not a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> be enrolled under threescore years of age.</q> And even after this great qualification of age he does not permit her to be ranked in this sacred society but mentions some additional requisites <q>well reported of for good works, if she have brought up children if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> feet if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190341"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:10</a></span> Heavens! What testing and scrutiny! How much <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> does he demand from the <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a>, and how precisely does he define it! Which he would not have done, had he not intended to entrust to her a position of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and dignity. And <q>the younger <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a></q> he says <q>refuse;</q> and then he adds the reason: <q>for when they have waxed wanton against Christ they will marry.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190342"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:11</a></span> By this expression he gives us to understand that they who have lost their husbands are wedded to Christ in their stead. Observe how he asserts this by way of indicating the mild and easy nature of this union; I refer to the passage <q>when they have waxed wanton against Christ they will marry,</q> as if He were some gentle husband who did not exercise authority over them, but suffered them to live in freedom. Neither did <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> confine his discourse on the subject to these remarks, but also in another place again he has manifested great anxiety about it where he says <q>Now she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives; but she who is a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> indeed and desolate has set her hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and continues in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and supplications day and night.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190343"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:6,&nbsp;5</a></span> And writing to the Corinthians he says <q>But she is more blessed if she abide thus.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190344"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse40">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:40</a></span> You see what great praise is bestowed upon widowhood, and this in the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a>, when the beauty of <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> also was clearly brought to light. Nevertheless even the lustre of this state could not obscure the glories of widowhood, which shines on brightly all the same, keeping its own value. When then we make mention of widowhood from time to time, do not be cast down, nor consider the matter a reproach; for if this be a matter of reproach, far more so is <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a>. But this is not the case; no! God forbid. For inasmuch as we all admire and welcome <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who live continently while their husbands are yet alive must we not be delighted with those who manifest the same good feeling concerning their husbands when they have departed this, life, and praise them accordingly? As I was saying then, as long as you lived with the blessed Therasius you enjoyed <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and consideration such as is natural for a wife to receive from a husband; but now in his place you have God who is the Lord of all, who has of old been your protector and will be so now still more and with yet greater earnestness; and as I have already said He has displayed no slight token of his <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providential</a> care by having preserved you whole and unharmed in the midst of such a furnace of anxiety and sorrow, and not suffering you to undergo anything undesirable. Now if He has not permitted any shipwreck to take place in the midst of so much rough water, much more will He preserve your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in calm weather and lighten the burden of your widowhood, and the consequences of it which seem to be so terrible.</p>

<p>3. Now if it is not the name of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> which distresses you, but the loss of such a husband I grant you that all the world over among men engaged in secular affairs there have been few like him, so affectionate, so gentle, so <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>, so sincere, so understanding, so devout. And certainly if he had altogether perished, and utterly ceased to be, it would be right to be distressed, and sorrowful; but if he has only sailed into the tranquil haven, and taken his journey to Him who is really his king, one ought not to mourn but to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> on these accounts. For this death is not death, but only a kind of emigration and translation from the worse to the better, from earth to heaven, from men to <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and archangels, and Him who is the Lord of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> and archangels. For here on earth while he was serving the emperor there were dangers to be expected and many plots arising from men who bore ill-will, for in proportion as his <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> increased did the designs also of enemies abound; but now that he has departed to the other world none of these things can be suspected. Wherefore in proportion as you grieve that God has taken away one who was so good and worthy you ought to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> that he has departed in much safety and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and being released from the trouble which besets this present season of danger, is in great peace and tranquillity. For is it not out of place to acknowledge that heaven is far better than earth, and yet to mourn those who are translated from this world to the other? For if that blessed husband of yours had been one of those who lived a shameful life contrary to what God approved it would have been right to bewail and lament for him not only when he had departed, but while he was still living; but inasmuch as he was one of those who are the friends of God we should take pleasure in him not only while living, but also when he has been laid to rest. And that we ought to act thus you have surely heard the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a> <q>to depart and to be with Christ which is far better.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190345"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse33">Philippians&nbsp;1:33</a></span> But perhaps you long to hear your husband's words, and enjoy the affection which you bestowed upon him, and you yearn for his society, and the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which you had on his account, and the splendour, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and security, and all these things being gone distress and darken your life. Well! The affection which you be stowed on him you can keep now just as you formerly did.</p>

<p>For such is the power of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, it embraces, and unites, and fastens together not only those who are present, and near, and visible but also those who are far distant; and neither length of time, nor separation in space, nor anything else of that kind can break up and sunder in pieces the affection of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But if you wish to behold him face to face (for this I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> is what you specially long for) keep your bed in his <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> sacred from the touch of any other man, and do your best to manifest a life like his, and then assuredly you shall depart one day to join the same company with him, not to dwell with him for five years as you did here, nor for 20, or 100, nor for a thousand or twice that number but for <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> and endless ages. For it is not any physical relation, but a correspondence in the way of living which qualifies for the inheritance of those regions of rest. For if it was identity of moral constitution which brought Lazarus although a stranger to <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> into the same heavenly bosom with him, and qualifies many from east and west to sit down with him, the place of rest will receive you also with the good Therasius, if you will exhibit the same manner of life as his, and then you shall receive him back again no longer in that corporeal beauty which he had when he departed, but in lustre of another kind, and splendour outshining the rays of the sun. For this body, even if it reaches a very high standard of beauty is nevertheless perishable; but the bodies of those who have been well pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, will be invested with such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as these eyes cannot even look upon. And God has furnished us with certain tokens, and obscure indications of these things both in the Old and in the New Dispensation. For in the former the face of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> shone with such <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> as to be intolerable to the eyes of the <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, and in the New the face of Christ shone far more brilliantly than his. For tell me if any one had promised to make your husband king of all the earth, and then had commanded you to withdraw for twenty years on his account, and had promised after that to restore him to you with the diadem and the purple, and to place you again in the same rank with him, would you not have meekly endured the separation with due self-control? Would you not have been well pleased with the gift, and deemed it a thing worth <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> for? Well then submit to this now, not for the sake of a kingdom on earth, but of a kingdom in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; not to receive him back clad in a vesture of gold but robed in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> such as is fitting for them to have who dwell in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. And if you find the trial very unbearable owing to its long duration, it may be that he will visit you by means of visions and converse with you as he was wont to do, and show you the face for which you yearn: let this be your consolation taking the place of letters, though indeed it is far more definite than letters. For in the latter case there are but lines traced with the pen to look upon, but in the former you see the form of his visage, and his gentle smile, his figure and his movements, you hear his speech and recognize the voice which you loved so well.</p>

<p>4. But since you mourn also over the loss of security which you formerly enjoyed on his account, and perhaps also for the sake of those great hopes of distinction which were dawning (for I used to hear that he would speedily arrive at the dignity of pr&aelig;fect, and this, I fancy, it is which more especially upsets and distresses your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>) consider I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> the case of those who have been in a higher official position than his, and yet have brought their life to a very pitiable end. Let me recall them to your memory: you probably <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Theodore of <a href="../cathen/13772a.htm">Sicily</a> by <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>:  for he was one of the most distinguished men; he surpassed all in bodily stature and beauty as well as in the confidence which he enjoyed with the Emperor, and he had more power than any member of the royal household, but he did not bear this prosperity meekly, and having entered into a plot against the Emperor he was taken prisoner and miserably beheaded; and his wife who was not a whit inferior to your noble self in education and birth and all other respects was suddenly stripped of all her possessions, deprived even of her freedom also, and enrolled among the household slaves, and compelled to lead a life more pitiable than any bondmaid, having this advantage only over the rest that owing to the extreme severity of her calamity she moved to tears all who beheld her. And it is said also that Artemisia who was the wife of a man of high <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a>, since he also aimed at usurping the throne, was reduced to this same condition of poverty, and also to blindness; for the depth of her despondency, and the abundance of her tears destroyed her sight; and now she has need of <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to lead her by the hand, and to conduct her to the doors of others that she may obtain the necessary supply of food.  And I might mention many other <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a> which have been brought down in this way did I not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> you to be too <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> in disposition to wish to find consolation for your own calamity out of the misfortunes of others. And the only reason why I mentioned those instances to which I referred just now was that you might learn that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> things are nothingness but that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> as the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says <q>all the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of man is as the flower of grass.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190348"><a href="../bible/isa040.htm#verse5">Isaiah&nbsp;40:5</a></span> For in proportion to men's elevation and splendour is the ruin wrought for them, not only in the case of those who are under rule, but also of the rulers themselves. For it would be impossible to find any private <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> which has been immersed in such great calamities as the ills in which the imperial house has been steeped. For untimely loss of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, and of husbands, and violent forms of death, more outrageous and painful than those which occur in tragedies, especially beset this kind of government.</p>

<p>Now passing over ancient times, of those who have reigned in our own generation, nine in all, only two have ended their life by a natural death; and of the others one was slain by a usurper,  one in battle,  one by a conspiracy of his household guards,  one by the very man who elected him, and invested him with the purple,  and of their wives some, as it is reported, perished by poison, others died of mere sorrow; while of those who still survive one, who has an orphan son, is trembling with alarm lest any of those who are in power dreading what may happen in the future should destroy him;  another has reluctantly yielded to much entreaty to return from the exile into which she had been driven by him who held the chief power.  And of the wives of the present rulers the one who has recovered a little from her former calamities has much sorrow mingled with her <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> because the possessor of power is still young and inexperienced and has many designing men on all sides of him;  and the other is ready to die of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and spends her time more miserably than criminals condemned to death because her husband ever since he assumed the crown up to the present day has been constantly engaged in warfare and fighting, and is more exhausted by the shame and the reproaches which assail him on all sides than by actual calamities.  For that which has never taken place has now come to pass, the barbarians leaving their own country have overrun an <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> space of our territory, and that many times over, and having set fire to the land, and captured the towns they are not minded to return home again, but after the manner of men who are keeping holiday rather than making <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, they laugh us all to scorn;  and it is said that one of their kings declared that he was amazed at the impudence of our soldiers, who although slaughtered more easily than sheep still expect to conquer, and are not willing to quit their own country; for he said that he himself was satiated with the work of cutting them to pieces. Imagine what the feelings of the Emperor and his wife must be on hearing these words!</p>

<p>5. And since I have made mention of this <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, a great crowd of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a> has occurred to me, who in past times derived very great lustre from the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> enjoyed by their husbands, but now are all arrayed in a dark mourning robe and spend their whole time in lamentation. For they had not the advantage which was enjoyed by your dear self. For thou, my excellent friend, saw that goodly husband of yours lying on his bed, and heard his last words, and receive his instructions as to what should be done about the affairs of the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and learn how by the provisions of his will they were guarded against every kind of encroachment on the part of rapacious and designing men. And not only this, but also when he was yet lying dead you often flung yourself upon the body, and <a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kissed</a> his eyes, and embraced him, and wailed over him, and you saw him conducted to burial with much <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, and did everything necessary for his obsequies, as was fitting, and from frequent visits to his grave you have no slight consolation of your sorrow. But these <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> have been deprived of all these things, having all sent out their husbands to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> in the hope of receiving them back again, instead of which it has been their lot to receive the bitter tidings of their death. Neither has any one come back to them with the bodies of their slain, or bringing anything save a message describing the manner of their death. And some there are who have not even been vouchsafed this record, or been enabled to learn how their husbands fell, as they were buried beneath a heap of slain in the thick of battle.</p>

<p>And what wonder if most of the generals perished thus, when even the Emperor himself having been blockaded in a certain village with a few soldiers did not dare to go out and oppose the assailants, but remained inside and when the enemy had set fire to the building was burnt to death together with all that were therein, not men only, but horses, beams and walls, so that the whole was turned into a heap of ashes? And this was the tale which they who departed to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> with the Emperor brought back to his wife in place of the Emperor himself.  For the splendours of the world differ in no-wise whatever from the things which happen on the stage, and the beauty of spring flowers. For in the first place they flee away before they have been manifested; and then, even if they have strength to last a little while, they speedily become ready to decay. For what is more worthless than the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which is paid by the multitude? What fruit has it? What kind of profit? What serviceable end does it meet? And would that this only was the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>! But in fact besides failing to get anything good from the possession, he who owns this most cruel mistress is continually forced to bear much which is painful and injurious; for mistress she is of those who own her, and in proportion as she is flattered by her slaves does she exalt herself against them, and ties them down by increasingly harsh commands; but she would never be able to revenge herself on those who despise and neglect her; so much fiercer is she than any tyrant and wild beast. For tyrants and wild animals are often mollified by humouring, but her fury is greatest when we are most complaisant to her, and if she finds any one who will listen to her, and yield to her in everything there is no kind of command from which in future she can be induced to abstain. Moreover she has also another ally whom one would not do wrong to call her daughter. For after she herself has grown to maturity and fairly taken root among us, she then produces arrogance, a thing which is no less able than herself to drive the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of those who possess it into headlong ruin.</p>

<p>6. Tell me then do you lament this that God has reserved you from such a cruel bondage, and that He has barred every avenue against these pestilential diseases? For while your husband was living they ceased not continually assaulting the thoughts of your heart, but since his death they have no starting point whence they can lay hold of your understanding. This then is a discipline which ought to be practised in future&mdash; to abstain from lamenting the withdrawal of these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, and from hankering after the bitter tyranny which they exercise. For where they blow a heavy blast they upset all things from the foundation and shatter them to pieces; and just as many prostitutes, although by nature ill favoured and ugly, do yet by means of enamels and pigments excite the feelings of the youthful while they are still tender, and when they have got them under their control treat them more insolently than any slave; so also do these <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a>, vainglory and arrogance, defile the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of men more than any other kind of pollution.</p>

<p>On this account also <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> has seemed to the majority of men to be a good thing; at least when it is stripped of this passion of vainglory it will no longer seem desirable. At any rate those who have been permitted to obtain in the midst of their poverty popular <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> have no longer preferred <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, but rather have despised much gold when it was bestowed upon them. And you have no need to learn from me who these men were, for you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> them better than I do, Epaminondas, Socrates, Aristeides, Diogenes, Krates who turned his own land into a sheep walk.  The others indeed, inasmuch as it was not possible for them to get rich, saw <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> brought to them in the midst of their poverty, and straightway devoted themselves to it, but this man threw away even what he possessed; so infatuated were they in the pursuit of this cruel monster. Let us not then weep because God has rescued us from this shameful thraldom which is an object of derision and of much reproach; for there is nothing splendid in it save the name it bears, and in reality it places those who possess it in a position which belies its appellation, and there is no one who does not laugh to scorn the man who does anything with a view to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. For it is only he who has not an eye to this who will be enabled to win respect and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but he who sets a great value on popular <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and does and endures everything for the sake of obtaining it is the very man who will fail to attain it, and be subjected to all the exact opposites of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, ridicule, and accusation, scoffing, enmity and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>. And this is wont to happen not only among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but also among you <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and indeed more especially in your case. For the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who is unaffected in mien, and gait, and dress, and seeks no <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> from any one is admired by all <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and they are ecstatic in their praise and call her blessed, and invoke all manner of <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things upon her; but a vain-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> they behold with aversion and detestation, and avoid her like some wild beast and load her with <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> execrations and abuse. And not only do we escape these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> by refusing to accept popular <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, but we shall gain the highest advantages in addition to those which have been already mentioned, being trained gradually to loosen our hold of earth and move in the direction of heaven, and despise all worldly things. For he who feels no need of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> which comes from men, will perform with security whatever <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things he does, and neither in the troubles, nor in the prosperities of this life will he be very seriously affected; for neither can the former depress him, and cast him down, nor can the latter elate and puff him up, but in precarious and troubled circumstances he himself remains exempt from change of any kind. And this I expect will speedily be the case with your own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and having once for all torn yourself away from all worldly interests you will display among us a heavenly manner of life, and in a little while will laugh to scorn the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> which you now lament, and despise its hollow and vain mask. But if you long for the security which you formerly enjoyed owing to your husband, and the protection of your property, and immunity from the designs of any of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who trample upon the misfortunes of others <q>Cast your care upon the Lord and He will nourish you.</q>  <q>For look,</q> it is said, <q>to past generations and see, who ever placed his hope on the Lord and was put to shame, or who ever called upon Him, and was neglected, or who ever remained constant to His commandments and was forsaken?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190361"><a href="../bible/sir002.htm#verse10">Sirach&nbsp;2:10</a></span> For He who has alleviated this intolerable calamity, and placed you even now in a state of tranquillity will also avert impending <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>; for that you will never receive another blow more severe than this you would yourself admit. Having then so bravely borne present troubles, and this when you were inexperienced, you will far more easily endure future events should any of the things contrary to our wishes, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> forbid, occur. Therefore seek <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, and all things which conduce to life in the other world, and none of the things here will be able to harm you, not even the world-ruler of darkness himself, if only we do not injure ourselves. For if any one deprives us of our substance, or hews our body in pieces, none of these things concern us, if our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> abides in its integrity.</p>

<p>7. Now, once for all, if you wish your property to abide with you in security and yet further to increase I will show you the plan, and the place where none of those who have designs upon it will be allowed to enter. What then is the place? It is <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. Send away your possessions to that good husband of yours and neither thief, nor schemer, nor any other destructive thing will be able to pounce upon them. If you deposit these goods in the other world, you will find much profit arising from them. For all things which we plant in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> yield a large and abundant crop, such as might naturally be expected from things which have their roots in <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>. And if you do this, see what blessings you will enjoy, in the first place <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life and the things promised to those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q>which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have they entered into the heart of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>,</q> and in the second place perpetual intercourse with your good husband; and you will relieve yourself from the cares and fears, and dangers, and designs, and enmity and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> which beset you here. For as long as you are surrounded with this property there will probably be some to make attempts upon it; but if you transfer it to <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, you will lead a life of security and safety, and much tranquillity, enjoying independence combined with godliness. For it is very irrational, when one wishes to buy land, and is seeking for productive ground, if, <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a> being proposed to him instead of earth, and the possibility presented of obtaining an estate there he abides still on earth, and puts up with the toils that are connected with it; for it often disappoints our hopes.</p>

<p>But since your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is grievously upset and vexed on account of the expectation often entertained that your husband would attain the rank of prefect, and the thought that he was untimely snatched away from that dignity consider first of all this fact, that even if this hope was a very well grounded one nevertheless it was only a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> hope, which often falls to the ground; and we see many things of this kind happening in life, those which were confidently expected having remained unfulfilled, whereas those which never even entered the mind have frequently come to pass, and this we constantly see occurring everywhere in cases of governments and kingdoms, and inheritances, and marriages. Wherefore even if the opportunity were very near at hand, yet as the proverb says <q>between the cup and the lip there is many a slip</q> and the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says <q>from the morning until the evening the time is changed.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190362"><a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse26">Sirach&nbsp;18:26</a></span> </p>

<p>So also a king who is here today is dead tomorrow; and again this same wise man illustrating the reversal of men's hopes says <q>many tyrants have sat down upon the ground, and one that was never thought of has worn the crown.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note190363"><a href="../bible/sir011.htm#verse5">Sirach&nbsp;11:5</a></span> And it was not absolutely certain that if he lived he would arrive at this dignity; for that which belongs to the future is uncertain, and causes us to have various suspicions. For on what grounds was it evident that had he lived he would have attained that dignity and that things would not have turned out the other way, and that he would have lost the office he actually held either from falling a victim to disease, or from being exposed to the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and ill will of those who wished to excel him in prosperity, or from suffering some other grievous misfortune. But let us suppose, if you please, that it was perfectly evident that in any case had he survived he would have obtained this high distinction; then in proportion to the magnitude of the dignity would have been the increased dangers, and anxieties, and intrigues which he must have encountered. Or put these even on one side, and let us suppose him to traverse that sea of difficulties safely, and in much tranquillity; then tell me what is the goal? Not that which he has now reached; no, not that, but something different, probably unpleasant and undesirable. In the first place his sight of heaven, and heavenly things would have been delayed, which is no small loss to those who have put their trust in things to come; and in the next place, even had he lived a very pure life yet the length of his life and the exigencies of his high office would have prevented his departing in such a pure condition as has now been the case. In fact it is uncertain whether he might not have undergone many changes and given way to indolence before he breathed his last. For now we are confident that by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God he has taken his flight to the region of rest, because he had not committed himself to any of those <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> which exclude from the kingdom of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>; but in that case after long contact with public business,  he might probably have contracted great defilement. For it is an exceedingly rare thing for one who is moving in the midst of such great <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> to hold a straight course, but to go astray, both wittingly and against his will, is a natural thing, and one which constantly occurs. But, as it is, we have been relieved from this apprehension, and we are firmly persuaded that in the great day he will appear in much radiance, shining forth near the King, and going with the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> in advance of Christ and clad with the robe of unutterable <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and standing by the side of the King as he gives judgment, and acting as one of His chief ministers. Wherefore desisting from mourning and lamentation do thou hold on to the same way of life as his, yea even let it be more exact, that having speedily attained an equal standard of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> with him, you may inhabit the same abode and be united to him again through the everlasting ages, not in this union of marriage but another far better. For this is only a bodily kind of intercourse, but then there will be a union of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> more perfect, and of a far more delightful and far nobler kind.</p>
