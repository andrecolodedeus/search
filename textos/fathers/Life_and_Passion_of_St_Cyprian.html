<h1>Life and Passion of St. Cyprian</h1>

<p> <em>By Pontius the Deacon</em></p>

<p>1. Although Cyprian, the devout <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, composed many writings whereby the memory of his worthy name survives; and although the profuse fertility of his eloquence and of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> so expands itself in the exuberance and richness of his discourse, that he will probably never cease to speak even to the end of the world; yet, since to his works and deserts it is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> due that his example should be recorded in writing, I have thought it wall to prepare this brief and compendious narrative. Not that the life of so great a man can be unknown to any even of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations, but that to our posterity also this incomparable and lofty pattern may be prolonged into <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> remembrance. It would assuredly be hard that, when our fathers have given such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> even to lay-people and <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> who have obtained <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, for reverence of their very <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, as to record many, or I had nearly said, well near all, of the circumstances of their sufferings, so that they might be brought to our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> also who as yet were not born, the passion of such a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> and such a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> as Cyprian should be passed over, who, independently of his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, had much to teach, and that what he did while he lived should be hidden from the world. And, indeed, these doings of his were such, and so great, and so admirable, that I am deterred by the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of their greatness, and confess myself incompetent to discourse in a way that shall be worthy of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of his deserts, and unable to relate such noble <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> in such a way that they may appear as great as in fact they are, except that the multitude of his glories is itself sufficient for itself, and needs no other heraldry. It enhances my difficulty, that you also are anxious to hear very much, or if it be possible every thing, about him, longing with eager warmth at least to become acquainted with his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, although now his living words are silent. And in this behalf, if I should say that the powers of eloquence fail me, I should say too little. For eloquence itself fails of suitable powers fully to satisfy your desire. And thus I am sorely pressed on both sides, since he burdens me with his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and you press me hard with your entreaties.</p>

<p>2. At what point, then, shall I begin&mdash;from what direction shall I approach the description of his goodness, except from the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and from his heavenly birth? Inasmuch as the doings of a man of God should not be reckoned from any point except from the time that he was born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He may have had pursuits previously, and liberal arts may have imbued his mind while engaged therein; but these things I pass over; for as yet they had nothing to do with anything but his secular advantage. But when he had learned sacred <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and breaking through the clouds of this world had emerged into the light of spiritual wisdom, if I was with him in any of his doings, if I have discerned any of his more illustrious labours, I will speak of them; only asking meanwhile for this indulgence, that whatever I shall say too little (for too little I must needs say) may rather be attributed to my <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> than subtracted from his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. While his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was in its first rudiments, he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that before God nothing was worthy in comparison of the observance of . For he thought that the heart might then become what it ought to be, and the mind attain to the full capacity of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, if he trod under foot the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh with the robust and healthy vigour of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>. Who has ever recorded such a marvel? His second birth had not yet enlightened the new man with the entire splendour of the divine light, yet he was already overcoming the ancient and pristine darkness by the mere dawning of the light. Then&mdash; what is even greater&mdash; when he had learned from the reading of Scripture certain things not according to the condition of his novitiate, but in proportion to the earliness of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he immediately laid hold of what he had discovered, for his own advantage in deserving well of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  By distributing his means for the relief of the indigence of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, by dispensing the purchase-money of entire estates, he at once realized two benefits&mdash;the contempt of this world's ambition, than which nothing is more pernicious, and the observance of that mercy which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> has preferred even to His <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and which even he did not maintain who said that he had kept all the commandments of the law; whereby with premature swiftness of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> he almost began to be perfect before he had learned the way to be <a href="../cathen/11665b.htm">perfect</a>. Who of the ancients, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, has done this? Who of the most celebrated veterans in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whose hearts and ears have throbbed to the divine words for many years, has attempted any such thing, as this man&mdash; of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> yet unskilled, and whom, perhaps, as yet nobody trusted&mdash; surpassing the age of antiquity, accomplished by his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> and admirable labours? No one reaps immediately upon his sowing; no one presses out the vintage harvest from the trenches just formed; no one ever yet sought for ripened fruit from newly planted slips. But in him all incredible things concurred. In him the threshing preceded (if it may be said, for the thing is beyond belief)&mdash; preceded the sowing, the vintage the shoots, the fruit the root.</p>

<p>3. The apostle's epistle says <span class="stiki" id="note052055"><a href="../bible/1ti003.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;3:6</a></span> that novices should be passed over, lest by the stupor of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathenism</a> that yet clings to their unconfirmed minds, their untaught inexperience should in any respect <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> against God. He first, and I think he alone, furnished an illustration that greater progress is made by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> than by time. For although in the Acts of the Apostles  the eunuch is described as at once <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by Philip, because he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with his whole heart, this is not a fair parallel. For he was a Jew,  and as he came from the temple of the Lord he was reading the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah, and he hoped in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although as yet he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that He had come; while the other, coming from the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, began with a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> as mature as that with which few perhaps have finished their course. In short, in respect of God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, there was no delay, no postponement&mdash;I have said but little&mdash;he immediately received the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">presbyterate</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>.  For who is there that would not entrust every grade of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to one who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> with such a disposition? There are many things which he did while still a <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">layman</a>, and many things which now as a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> he did&mdash; many things which, after the examples of righteous men of old, and following them with a close imitation, he accomplished with the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of entire consecration&mdash; that deserved well of the Lord.  For his discourse concerning this was usually, that if he had read of any one being set forth with the praise of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he would persuade us to inquire on account of what doings he had pleased God. If Job, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> by God's testimony, was called a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> worshipper of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one to whom there was none upon earth to be compared, he taught that we should do whatever Job had previously done, so that while we are doing like things we may call forth a similar testimony of God for ourselves. He, contemning the loss of his estate, gained such advantage by his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> thus tried, that he had no perception of the temporal losses even of his affection. Neither poverty nor pain broke him down; the persuasion of his wife did not influence him; the dreadful suffering of his own body did not shake his firmness. His <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> remained established in its own home, and his devotion, rounded upon deep roots, gave way under no onset of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> tempting him to abstain from blessing his God with a grateful <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> even in his adversity. His house was open to every comer. No <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> returned from him with an empty lap; no blind man was unguided by him as a companion; none faltering in step was unsupported by him for a staff; none stripped of help by the hand of the mighty was not protected by him as a defender. Such things ought they to do, he was accustomed to say, who desire to please God. And thus running through the examples of all good men, by always imitating those who were better than others he made himself also worthy of imitation.</p>

<p>4. He had a close association among us with a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, and of praiseworthy memory, by name Caecilius, and in age as well as in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a>, who had converted him from his worldly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> to the acknowledgment of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> divinity. This man he loved with entire <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and all observance, regarding him with an <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> veneration, not only as the friend and comrade of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but as the parent of his new life. And at length he, influenced by his attentions, was, as well he might be, stimulated to such a pitch of excessive <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, that when he was departing from this world, and his summons was at hand, he commended to him his wife and children; so that him whom he had made a partner in the fellowship of his way of life, he afterwards made the heir of his affection.</p>

<p>5. It would be tedious to go through individual circumstances, it would be laborious to enumerate all his doings. For the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of his good works I think that this one thing is enough, that by the judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the favour of the people, he was chosen to the office of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> and the degree of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> while still a <a href="../cathen/10742a.htm">neophyte</a>, and, as it was considered, a novice. Although still in the early days of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and in the untaught season of his spiritual life, a generous disposition so shone forth in him, that although not yet resplendent with the glitter of office, but only of hope, he gave promise of entire trustworthiness for the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> that was coming upon him. Moreover, I will not pass over that remarkable fact, of the way in which, when the entire people by God's inspiration leapt forward in his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, he humbly withdrew, giving place to men of older standing, and thinking himself unworthy of a claim to so great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, so that he thus became more worthy. For he is made more worthy who dispenses with what he deserves. And with this excitement were the eager people at that time inflamed, desiring with a spiritual longing, as the event <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, not only a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>&mdash;for in him whom then with a latent foreboding of divinity they were in such wise demanding, they were seeking not only a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>&mdash;but moreover a future <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. A crowded fraternity was besieging the doors of the house, and throughout all the avenues of access an anxious <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> was circulating. Possibly that apostolic experience might then have happened to him, as he desired, of being let down through a window, had he also been equal to the apostle in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of ordination.  It was plain to be seen that all the rest were expecting his coming with an anxious spirit of suspense, and received him when he came with excessive <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. I speak unwillingly, but I must needs speak. Some resisted him, even that he might overcome them; yet with what gentleness, how patiently, how benevolently he gave them indulgence! How mercifully he forgave them, reckoning them afterwards, to the astonishment of many, among his closest and, most intimate friends! For who would not be amazed at the forgetfulness of a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> so retentive?</p>

<p>6. Henceforth who is sufficient to relate the manner in which he bore himself?&mdash; what pity was his? What vigour? How great his mercy? How great his strictness? So much <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> beamed from his face that it confounded the minds of the beholders. His countenance was grave and joyous. Neither was his severity gloomy, nor his affability excessive, but a mingled tempering of both; so that it might be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> whether he most deserved to be revered or to be loved, except that he deserved both to be revered and to be loved. And his dress was not out of harmony with his countenance, being itself also subdued to a fitting mean. The <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the world did not inflame him, nor yet did an excessively affected penury make him sordid, because this latter kind of attire arises no less from boastfulness, than does such an ambitious frugality from ostentation. But what did he as <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> in respect of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, whom as a catechumen he had loved? Let the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> consider, or those whom the teaching of their very rank has trained to the duty of good works, or those whom the common obligation of the Sacrament has bound to the duty of manifesting <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Cyprian the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> <em>cathedra</em> received such as he had been before&mdash;it did not make him so. </p>

<p>7. And therefore for such merits he at once obtained the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of proscription also. For nothing else was proper than that he who in the secret recesses of his <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> was rich in the full <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of religion and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, should moreover be renowned in the publicly diffused report of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. He might, indeed, at that time, in accordance with the rapidity wherewith he always attained everything, have hastened to the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> appointed for him, especially when with repeated calls he was frequently demanded for the lions, had it not been needful for him to pass through all the grades of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and thus to arrive at the highest, and had not the impending desolation needed the aid of so fertile a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>. For conceive of him as being at that time taken away by the dignity of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Who was there to show the advantage of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, advancing by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Who was there to restrain <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> to the fitting discipline of modesty and a dress worthy of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, as if with a kind of bridle of the lessons of the Lord? Who was there to teach penitence to the <a href="../cathen/09001b.htm">lapsed</a>, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, unity to schismatics, peacefulness and the law of evangelical <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to the sons of God? By whom were the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to be overcome by retorting upon themselves the accusations which they heap upon us? By whom were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of too tender an affection, or, what is of more importance, of a too feeble <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in respect of the loss of their friends, to be consoled with the hope of futurity? Whence should we so learn mercy? Whence patience? Who was there to restrain the ill blood arising from the envenomed malignity of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, with the sweetness of a wholesome remedy? Who was there to raise up such great <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> by the exhortation of his divine discourse? Who was there, in short, to animate so many confessors sealed with a second inscription on their distinguished brows, and reserved alive for an example of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, kindling their ardour with a heavenly trumpet? Fortunately, fortunately it occurred then, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> by the Spirit's direction, that the man who was needed for so many and so excellent purposes was withheld from the consummation of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. Do you wish to be assured that the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of his withdrawal was not <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>? To allege nothing else, he did suffer subsequently, and this suffering he assuredly would have evaded as usual, if he had evaded it before. It was indeed that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>&mdash; and rightly so&mdash; that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which would dread to offend the Lord&mdash; that <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> which prefers to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> God's commands rather than to be crowned in disobedience. For a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> dedicated in all things to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and thus enslaved to the divine admonitions, <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that even in suffering itself it would <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless it had <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> the Lord, who then bade <em>him seek</em> the place of concealment.</p>

<p>8. Moreover, I think that something may here be said about the benefit of the delay, although I have already touched slightly on the matter. By what appears subsequently to have occurred, it follows that we may prove that that withdrawal was not conceived by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> pusillanimity, but, I as indeed is the case, was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> divine. The unusual and violent rage of a cruel <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had laid waste God's people; and since the artful enemy could not deceive all by one fraud, wherever the incautious soldier laid bare his side, there in various manifestations of rage he had destroyed individuals with different kinds of overthrow. There needed some one who could, when men were wounded and hurt by the various arts of the attacking enemy, use the remedy of the celestial medicine according to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the wound, either for cutting or for cherishing them. <em>Thus</em> was preserved a man of an intelligence, besides other excellences, also spiritually trained, who between the resounding waves of the opposing schisms could steer the middle course of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in a steady path. Are not such plans, I ask, divine? Could this have been done without God? Let them consider who think that such things as these can happen by chance. To them the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> replies with clear voice, saying, <q>I do not allow and do not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that such needful then are reserved without the decree of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q></p>

<p>9. Still, if it seem well, let me glance at the rest. Afterwards there broke out a dreadful plague, and excessive destruction of a hateful disease invaded every house in succession of the trembling populace, carrying off day by day with abrupt attack numberless people, every one from his own house. All were shuddering, fleeing, shunning the contagion, impiously exposing their own friends, as if with the exclusion of the person who was sure to die of the plague, one could exclude death itself also. There lay about the meanwhile, over the whole city, no longer bodies, but the carcasses of many, and, by the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of a lot which in their turn would be theirs, demanded the pity of the passers-by for themselves. No one regarded anything besides his cruel gains. No one trembled at the remembrance of a similar event. No one did to another what he himself wished to experience. In these circumstances, it would be a wrong to pass over what the pontiff  of Christ did, who excelled the pontiffs of the world as much in kindly affection as he did in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of religion. On the people assembled together in one place he first of all urged the benefits of mercy, teaching by examples from divine lessons, how greatly the duties of benevolence avail to deserve well of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Then afterwards he subjoined, that there was nothing wonderful in our cherishing our own people only with the needed attentions of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but that he might become perfect who would do something more than the <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a> or the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, who, overcoming <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> with good, and practising a clemency which was like the divine clemency, loved even his enemies, who would <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those that <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> him, as the Lord admonishes and exhorts. God continually makes His sun to rise, and from time to time gives showers to nourish the seed, exhibiting all these kindnesses not only to His people, but to aliens also. And if a man professes to be a <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">son of God</a>, why does not he imitate the example of his Father? <q>It becomes us,</q> said he, <q>to answer to our birth; and it is not fitting that those who are evidently born of God should be degenerate, but rather that the propagation of a good Father should be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in His offspring by the emulation of His goodness.</q></p>

<p>10. I omit many other matters, and, indeed, many important ones, which the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of a limited space does not permit to be detailed in more lengthened discourse, and concerning which this much is sufficient to have been said. But if the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> could have heard these things as they stood before the rostrum, they would probably at once have <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. What, then, should a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> people do, whose very name proceeds from <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>? Thus the ministrations are constantly distributed according to the quality of the men and their degrees. Many who, by the straitness of poverty, were unable to manifest the kindness of <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, manifested more than <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, making up by their own labour a service dearer than all riches. And under such a teacher, who would not press forward to be found in some part of such a warfare, whereby he might please both <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and Christ the Judge, and for the present so excellent a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>? Thus what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> was done in the liberality of overflowing works to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, not to those only who are of the household of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Something more was done than is recorded of the incomparable benevolence of Tobias. He must forgive, and forgive again, and frequently forgive; or, to speak more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, he must of right concede that, although very much might be done before Christ, yet that something more might be done after Christ, since to His times all fullness is attributed. Tobias collected together those who were slain by the king and cast out, of his own race only.</p>

<p>11. Banishment followed these actions, so good and so benevolent. For impiety always makes this return, that it repays the better with the worse. And what God's <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> replied to the interrogation of the proconsul, there are Acts which relate. In the meantime, he is excluded from the city who had done some good for the city's safety; he who had striven that the eyes of the living should not suffer the horrors of the infernal abode; he, I say, who, vigilant in the watches of benevolence, had provided&mdash; oh <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>! With unacknowledged goodness&mdash; that when all were forsaking the desolate appearance of the city, a destitute state and a deserted country should not perceive its many exiles. But let the world look to this, which accounts banishment a penalty. To them, their country is too dear, and they have the same name as their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>; but we abhor even our <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> themselves if they would persuade us against God. To them, it is a severe punishment to live outside their own city; to the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, the whole of this world is one home. Wherefore, though he were banished into a hidden and secret place, yet, associated with the affairs of his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he cannot regard it as an exile. In addition, while honestly serving <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he is a stranger even in his own city. For while the continency of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> restrains him from carnal desires, he lays aside the conversation of the former man, and even among his fellow citizens, or, I might almost say, among the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> themselves of his earthly life, he is a stranger. Besides, although this might otherwise appear to be a punishment, yet in causes and sentences of this kind, which we suffer for the trial of the <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of our <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is not a punishment, because it is a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>. But, indeed, suppose banishment not to be a punishment to us, yet the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of their own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> may still attribute the last and worst <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to those who can lay upon the innocent what they think to be a punishment. I will not now describe a charming place; and, for the present, I pass over the addition of all possible delights. Let us conceive of the place, filthy in situation, squalid in appearance, having no wholesome water, no pleasantness of verdure, no neighbouring shore, but vast wooded rocks between the inhospitable jaws of a totally deserted solitude, far removed in the pathless regions of the world. Such a place might have borne the name of exile, if Cyprian, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had come there; although to him, if the ministrations of men had been wanting, either birds, as in the case of Elias, or <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, as in that of Daniel, would have ministered. Away, away with the belief that anything would be wanting to the least of us, so long as he stands for the confession of the name. So far was God's pontiff, who had always been urgent in merciful works, from needing the assistance of all these things.</p>

<p>12. And now let us return with thankfulness to what I had suggested in the second place, that for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of such a man there was divinely provided a sunny and suitable spot, a dwelling, secret as he wished, and all that has before been promised to be added to those who seek the kingdom and righteousness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, not to mention the number of the brethren who I visited him, and then the kindness of the citizens themselves, which supplied to him everything whereof he appeared to be deprived, I will not pass over God's wonderful visitation, whereby He wished His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in exile to be so certain of his passion that was to follow, that in his full confidence of the threatening <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, Curubis possessed not only an exile, but a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> too. For on that day whereon we first abode in the place of banishment (for the condescension of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> had chosen me among his household companions to a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> exile: would that he could also have chosen me to share his passion!),  <q>there appeared to me,</q> said he, <q>ere yet I was sunk in the repose of slumber, a young man of unusual stature, who, as it were, led me to the praetorium, where I seemed to myself to be led before the tribunal of the proconsul, then sitting. When he looked upon me, he began at once to note down a sentence on his tablet, which I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not, for he had asked nothing of me with the accustomed interrogation. But the youth, who was standing at his back, very anxiously read what had been noted down. And because he could not then declare it in words, he showed me by an intelligible sign what was contained in the writing of that tablet. For, with hand expanded and flattened like a blade, he imitated the stroke of the accustomed punishment, and expressed what he wished to be understood as clearly as by speech&mdash;I understood the future sentence of my passion. I began to ask and to beg immediately that a delay of at least one day should be accorded me, until I should have arranged my property in some reasonable order. And when I had urgently repeated my entreaty, he began again to note down, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not what, on his tablet. But I perceived from the calmness of his countenance that the judge's mind was moved by my petition, as being a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> one. Moreover, that youth, who already had disclosed to me the intelligence of my passion by gesture rather than by words, hastened to signify repeatedly by secret signal that the delay was granted which had been asked for until the morrow, twisting his fingers one behind the other. And I, although the sentence had not been read, although I rejoiced with very glad heart with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at the delay accorded, yet trembled so with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of the uncertainty of the interpretation, that the remains of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> still set my exulting heart beating with excessive agitation.</q></p>

<p>13. What could be more plain than this revelation? What could be more blessed than this condescension? Everything was foretold to him beforehand which subsequently followed. Nothing was diminished of the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nothing was mutilated of so sacred a promise. Carefully consider each particular in accordance with its announcement. He asks for delay till the morrow, when the sentence of his passion was under deliberation, begging that he might arrange his affairs on the day which he had thus obtained. This one day signified a year, which he was about to pass in the world after his vision. For, to speak more plainly, after the year was expired, he was crowned, on that day on which, at the commencement of the year, the fact had been announced to him. For although we do not read of the day of the Lord as a year in sacred Scripture, yet we regard that space of time as due in making promise of future things.  Whence is it of no consequence if, in this case, under the ordinary expression of a day, it is only a year that in this place is implied, because that which is the greater ought to be fuller in meaning. Moreover, that it was explained rather by signs than by speech, was because the utterance of speech was reserved for the manifestation of the time itself. For anything is usually set forth in words, whenever what is set forth is accomplished. For, indeed, no one <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> why this had been shown to him, until afterwards, when, on the very day on which he had seen it, he was crowned. Nevertheless, in the meantime, his impending suffering was certainly <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by all, but the exact day of his passion was not spoken of by any of the same, just as if they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of it. And, indeed, I find something similar in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>. For Zacharias the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, because he did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the promise of a son, made to him by the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, became dumb; so that he asked for tablets by a sign, being about to write his son's name rather than utter it. With reason, also in this case, where God's messenger declared the impending passion of His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> rather by signs, he both admonished his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and fortified His <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Moreover, the ground of asking for delay arose out of his wish to arrange his affairs and settle his will. Yet what affairs or what will had he to arrange, except <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> concerns? And thus that last delay was received, in order that whatever had to be disposed of by his final decision concerning the care of cherishing the poor might be arranged. And I think that for no other reason, and indeed for this reason only, indulgence was granted to him even by those very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who had ejected and were about to slay him, that, being at hand, he might relieve the poor also who were before him with the final or, to speak more accurately, with the entire outlay of his last stewardship. And therefore, having so benevolently ordered matters, and so arranged them according to his will, the morrow drew near.</p>

<p>14. Now also a messenger came to him from the city from Xistus, the good and peace-making <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, and on that account most blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. The coming executioner was instantly looked for who should strike through that devoted neck of the most sacred victim; and thus, in the daily expectation of dying, every day was to him as if the crown might be attributed to each. In the meantime, there assembled to him many eminent people, and people of most illustrious rank and <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, and noble with the world's distinctions, who, on account of ancient friendship with him, repeatedly urged his withdrawal; and, that their urgency might not be in some sort hollow, they also offered places to which he might retire. But he had now set the world aside, having his mind suspended upon heaven, and did not consent to their tempting persuasions. He would perhaps even then have done what was asked for by so many and faithful friends, if it had been bidden him by divine command. But that lofty <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of so great a man must not be passed over without announcement, that now, when the world was swelling, and of its trust in its princes breathing out <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the name, he was instructing God's servants, as opportunity was given, in the exhortations of the Lord, and was animating them to tread trader foot the sufferings of this present time by the <a href="../cathen/04324b.htm">contemplation</a> of a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> to come hereafter. Indeed, such was his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of sacred discourse, that he wished that his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> in regard to his suffering might be so answered, that he would be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> in the very act of speaking about God.</p>

<p>15. And these were the daily acts of a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> destined for a pleasing <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when, behold, at the bidding of the proconsul, the officer with his soldiers on a sudden came unexpectedly on him&mdash;or rather, to speak more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, thought that he had come unexpectedly on him, at his gardens&mdash;at his gardens, I say, which at the beginning of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he had sold, and which, being restored by God's mercy, he would assuredly have sold again for the use of the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, if he had not wished to avoid ill-will from the persecutors. But when could a <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a> ever prepared be taken unawares, as if by an unforeseen attack? Therefore now he went forward, certain that what had been long delayed would be settled. He went forward with a lofty and elevated mien, manifesting cheerfulness in his look and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> in his heart. But being delayed to the morrow, he returned from the praetorium to the officer's house, when on a sudden a scattered rumour prevailed throughout all <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, that now Thascius was brought forward, whom there was nobody who did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> as well for his illustrious fame in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> opinion of all, as on account of the recollection of his most renowned work. On all sides all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were flocking together to a spectacle, to us <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> from the devotion of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and to be mourned over even by the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>. A gentle custody, however, had him in charge when taken and placed for one night in the officer's house; so that we, his associates and friends, were as usual in his company. The whole people in the meantime, in anxiety that nothing should be done throughout the night without their <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, kept watch before the officer's door. The goodness of God granted him at that time, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> worthy of it, that even God's people should watch on the passion of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>. Yet, perhaps, some one may ask what was the reason of his returning from the praetorium to the officer. And some think that this arose from the fact, that for his own part the proconsul was then unwilling. Far be it from me to complain, in matters divinely ordered, of slothfulness or aversion in the proconsul. Far be it from me to admit such an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> into the consciousness of a religious <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as that the fancy of man should decide the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> of so blessed a <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>. But the morrow, which a year before the divine condescension had foretold, required to be literally the morrow. </p>

<p>16. At last that other day dawned&mdash; that destined, that promised, that divine day&mdash; which, if even the tyrant himself had wished to put off, he would not have had any power to do so; the day rejoicing at the consciousness of the future <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>; and, the clouds being scattered throughout the circuit of the world, the day shone upon them with a brilliant sun. He went out from the house of the officer, though he was the officer of Christ and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and was walled in on all sides by the ranks of a mingled multitude. And such a numberless army hung upon his company, as if they had come with an assembled troop to assault death itself. Now, as he went, he had to pass by the race-course. And rightly, and as if it had been contrived on purpose, he had to pass by the place of a corresponding struggle, who, having finished his contest, was running to the crown of righteousness. But when he had come to the praetorium, as the proconsul had not yet come forth, a place of retirement was accorded him. There, as he sat moistened after his long journey with excessive perspiration (the seat was by chance covered with linen, so that even in the very moment of his passion he might enjoy the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a>),  one of the officers (<q>Tesserarius</q>), who had formerly been a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, offered him his clothes, as if he might wish to change his moistened garments for drier ones; and he doubtless <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">coveted</a> nothing further in respect of his proffered kindness than to possess the now blood-stained sweat of the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> going to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He made reply to him, and said, <q>We apply medicines to annoyances which probably today will no longer exist.</q> Is it any wonder that he despised suffering in body who had despised death in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? Why should we say more? He was suddenly announced to the proconsul; he is brought forward; he is placed before him; he is interrogated as to his name. He answers who he is, and nothing more.</p>

<p>17. And thus, therefore, the judge reads from his tablet the sentence which lately in the vision he had not read&mdash;a spiritual sentence, not rashly to be spoken&mdash;a sentence worthy of such a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and such a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> sentence, wherein he was called a standard-bearer of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, and an enemy of the gods, and one who was to be an example to his people; and that with his blood discipline would begin to be established. Nothing could be more complete, nothing more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, than this sentence. For all the things which were said, although said by a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, are divine. Nor is it indeed to be wondered at, since <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> are accustomed to prophesy of the passion. He had been a standard-bearer, who was accustomed to teach concerning the bearing of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> standard; he had been an enemy of the gods, who commanded the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to be destroyed. Moreover, he gave example to his friends, since, when many were about to follow in a similar manner, he was the first in the province to consecrate the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. And by his blood discipline began to be established; but it was the discipline of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, who, emulating their teacher, in the imitation of a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> like his own, themselves also gave a confirmation to discipline by the very blood of their own example.</p>

<p>18. And when he left the doors of the praetorium, a crowd of soldiery accompanied him; and that nothing might be wanting in his passion, centurions and tribunes guarded his side. Now the place itself where he was about to suffer is level, so that it affords a noble spectacle, with its trees thickly planted on all sides. But as, by the extent of the space beyond, the view was not attainable to the confused crowd, <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who favoured him had climbed up into the branches of the trees, that there might not even be wanting to him (what happened in the case of Zacchaeus), that he was gazed upon from the trees. And now, having with his own hands bound his eyes, he tried to hasten the slowness of the executioner, whose office was <em>to wield</em> the sword, and who with difficulty clasped the blade in his failing right hand with trembling fingers, until the mature hour of glorification strengthened the hand of the centurion with power granted from above to accomplish the death of the excellent man, and at length supplied him with the permitted strength. O blessed people of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who as well in sight as in feeling, and, what is more, in outspoken words, suffered with such a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> as theirs; and, as they had ever heard him in his own discourses, were crowned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Judge! For although that which the general wish desired could not occur, viz. that the entire congregation should suffer at once in the fellowship of a like <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, yet whoever under the eyes of Christ beholding, and in the hearing of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, eagerly desired to suffer, by the sufficient testimony of that desire did in some sort send a missive to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as his ambassador.</p>

<p>19. His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> being thus accomplished, it resulted that Cyprian, who had been an example to all good men, was also the first who in Africa imbued his <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> crown  <em>with blood of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a></em>, because he was the first who began to be such after the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. For from the time at which the episcopal order is enumerated at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, not one is ever recorded, even of good men and <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, to have come to suffering. Although devotion surrendered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> is always in <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> men reckoned instead of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; yet Cyprian attained even to the perfect crown by the consummation of the Lord; so that in that very city in which he had in such wise lived, and in which he had been the first to do many noble <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, he also was the first to decorate the insignia  of his heavenly <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> with <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> gore. What shall I do now? Between <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> at his passion, and grief at still remaining, my mind is divided in different directions, and twofold affections are burdening a heart too limited for them. Shall I grieve that I was not his associate? But yet I must triumph in his victory. Shall I triumph at his victory? Still I grieve that I am not his companion. Yet still to you I must in simplicity confess, what you also are aware of, that it was my intention to be his companion. Much and excessively I exult at his <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but still more do I grieve that I remained behind.</p>
