<h1>Life of Constantine (Book I)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Preface.&mdash; Of the Death of Constantine.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Already </span> have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> united in celebrating with joyous festivities the completion of the second and third decennial period of this great emperor's reign; already have we ourselves received him as a triumphant conqueror in the assembly of God's ministers, and greeted him with the due meed of praise on the twentieth anniversary of his reign:  and still more recently we have woven, as it were, garlands of words, wherewith we encircled his sacred head in his own palace on his thirtieth anniversary. </p>

<p>But now, while I desire  to give utterance to some of the customary sentiments, I stand perplexed and doubtful which way to turn, being wholly lost in wonder at the extraordinary spectacle before me. For to whatever quarter I direct my view, whether to the east, or to the west, or over the whole world, or toward heaven itself, everywhere and always I see the blessed one yet administering the self-same empire. On earth I behold his sons, like some new reflectors of his brightness, diffusing everywhere the luster of their father's character,  and himself still living and powerful, and governing all the affairs of men more completely than ever before, being multiplied in the succession of his children. They had indeed had previously the dignity of C&aelig;sars;  but now, being invested with his very self, and graced by his accomplishments, for the excellence of their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> they are proclaimed by the titles of Sovereign, Augustus, Worshipful, and Emperor.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Preface Continued.</h2>

<p>And I am indeed amazed, when I consider that he who was but lately visible and present with us in his mortal body, is still, even after death, when the natural thought disclaims everything superfluous as unsuitable, most marvelously endowed with the same imperial dwellings, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>, and praises as heretofore.  But farther, when I raise my thoughts even to the arch of heaven, and there contemplate his thrice-blessed <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in communion with God himself, freed from every mortal and earthly vesture, and shining in a refulgent robe of light, and when I perceive that it is no more connected with the fleeting periods and occupations of mortal life, but <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with an ever-blooming crown, and an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a> of endless and blessed <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, I stand as it were without power of speech or thought  and unable to utter a single phrase, but condemning my own weakness, and imposing silence on myself, I resign the task of speaking his praises worthily to one who is better able, even to him who, being the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> God and veritable Word, alone has power to confirm his own sayings. </p>

<h2>Chapter 3. How God honors Pious Princes, but destroys Tyrants.</h2>

<p>Having given assurance that those who glorify and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> him will meet with an abundant recompense at his hands, while those who set themselves against him as enemies and adversaries will compass the ruin of their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, he has already established the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of these his own declarations, having shown on the one hand the fearful end of those tyrants who denied and opposed him,  and at the same time having made it manifest that even the death of his servant, as well as his life, is worthy of admiration and praise, and <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> claims the memorial, not merely of perishable, but of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> monuments.</p>

<p>Mankind, devising some consolation for the frail and precarious duration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, have thought by the erection of monuments to glorify the memories of their ancestors with <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>. Some have employed the vivid delineations and colors of painting ; some have carved <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> from lifeless blocks of wood; while others, by engraving their inscriptions deep on tablets  and monuments, have thought to transmit the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of those whom they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> to perpetual remembrance. All these indeed are perishable, and consumed by the lapse of time, being representations of the corruptible body, and not expressing the image of the <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. And yet these seemed sufficient to those who had no well-grounded hope of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> after the termination of this mortal life. But <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I say, who is the common Saviour of all, having treasured up with himself, for those who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> godliness, greater blessings than <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> thought has conceived, gives the earnest and <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of future rewards even here, assuring in some sort <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> hopes to mortal eyes. The ancient oracles of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, delivered to us in the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>, declare this; the lives of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men, who shone in old time with every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, bear <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to posterity of the same; and our own days prove it to be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, wherein Constantine, who alone of all that ever wielded the Roman power was the friend of God the Sovereign of all, has appeared to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> so clear an example of a godly life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. That God honored Constantine.</h2>

<p>And God himself, whom Constantine worshipped, has confirmed this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by the clearest manifestations of his will, being present to aid him  at the commencement, during the course, and at the end of his reign, and holding him up to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> as an instructive example of godliness. Accordingly, by the manifold blessings he has conferred on him, he has distinguished him alone of all the sovereigns of whom we have ever heard as at once a mighty luminary and most clear-voiced herald of genuine <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. That he reigned above Thirty Years, and lived above Sixty.</h2>

<p>With respect to the duration of his reign, God <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> him with three complete periods of ten years, and something more, extending the whole term of his mortal life to twice this number of years.  And being pleased to make him a representative of his own sovereign power, he displayed him as the conqueror of the whole race of tyrants, and the destroyer of those God-defying giants  of the earth who madly raised their impious arms against him, the supreme King of all. They appeared, so to speak, for an instant, and then disappeared: while the one and only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when he had enabled his servant, clad in heavenly panoply, to stand singly against many foes, and by his means had relieved <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> from the multitude of the ungodly, constituted him a teacher of his worship to all nations, to testify with a loud voice in the hearing of all that he acknowledged the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and turned with abhorrence from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of them that are no gods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. That he was the Servant of God, and the Conqueror of Nations.</h2>

<p>Thus, like a faithful and good servant, did he act and testify, openly declaring and confessing himself the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> minister of the supreme King. And God immediately rewarded him, by making him ruler and sovereign, and victorious to such a degree that he alone of all rulers pursued a continual course of conquest, unsubdued and invincible, and through his trophies a greater ruler than tradition records ever to have been before. So dear was he to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and so blessed; so <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and so fortunate in all that he undertook, that with the greatest facility he obtained the authority over more nations than any who had preceded him,  and yet retained his power, undisturbed, to the very close of his life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Comparison with Cyrus, King of the Persians, and with Alexander of Macedon.</h2>

<p>Ancient history describes Cyrus, king of the Persians, as by far the most illustrious of all kings up to his time. And yet if we regard the end of his days,  we find it but little corresponded with his past prosperity, since he met with an inglorious and dishonorable death at the hands of a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>. </p>

<p>Again, the sons of Greece celebrate Alexander the Macedonian as the conqueror of many and diverse nations; yet we find that he was removed by an early death, before he had reached maturity, being carried off by the effects of revelry and <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>.  His whole life embraced but the space of thirty-two years, and his reign extended to no more than a third part of that period. Unsparing as the thunderbolt, he advanced through streams of blood and reduced entire nations and cities, young and old, to utter slavery. But when he had scarcely arrived at the maturity of life, and was lamenting the loss of youthful pleasures, death fell upon him with terrible stroke, and, that he might not longer outrage the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, cut him off in a foreign and hostile land, childless, without successor, and homeless. His kingdom too was instantly dismembered, each of his officers taking away and appropriating a portion for himself. And yet this man is extolled for such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> as these. </p>

<h2>Chapter 8. That he conquered nearly the Whole World.</h2>

<p>But our emperor began his reign at the time of life at which the Macedonian died, yet doubled the length of his life, and trebled the length of his reign. And instructing his army in the mild and sober precepts of godliness, he carried his arms as far as the Britons, and the nations that dwell in the very bosom of the Western ocean. He subdued likewise all Scythia, though situated in the remotest North, and divided into numberless diverse and barbarous tribes. He even pushed his conquests to the Blemmyans and <a href="../cathen/05566a.htm">Ethiopians</a>, on the very confines of the South; nor did he think the acquisition of the Eastern nations unworthy his care. In short, diffusing the effulgence of his <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> light to the ends of the whole world, even to the most distant Indians, the nations dwelling on the extreme circumference of the inhabited earth, he received the submission of all the rulers,  governors,  and satraps of barbarous nations, who cheerfully welcomed and saluted him, sending embassies and presents, and setting the highest value on his acquaintance and friendship; insomuch that they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> him with pictures and <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> in their respective countries, and Constantine alone of all emperors was acknowledged and celebrated by all. Notwithstanding, even among these distant nations,  he proclaimed the name of his God in his royal edicts with all boldness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. That he was the Son of a Pious Emperor, and bequeathed the Power to Royal Sons.</h2>

<p>Nor did he give this testimony in words merely, while exhibiting failure in his own practice, but pursued every path of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and was rich in the varied fruits of godliness. He ensured the affection of his friends by magnificent <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of liberality; and inasmuch as he governed on principles of humanity, he caused his rule to be but lightly felt and acceptable to all classes of his subjects; until at last, after a long course of years, and when he was wearied by his divine labors, the God whom he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> crowned him with an <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a> reward, and translated him from a transitory kingdom to that endless life which he has laid up in store for the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> of his <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, after he had raised him up three sons to succeed him in his power. As then the imperial throne had descended to him from his father, so, by the law of nature, was it reserved for his children and their descendants, and perpetuated, like some paternal inheritance, to endless generations. And indeed God himself, who distinguished this blessed prince with divine <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> while yet present with us, and who has adorned his death with choice blessings from his own hand, should be the writer of his actions; since he has recorded his labors and successes on heavenly monuments. </p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Of the Need for this History, and its Value for Edification.</h2>

<p>However, hard as it is to speak worthily of this blessed character, and though silence were the safer and less perilous course, nevertheless it is incumbent on me, if I would escape the charge of negligence and sloth, to trace as it were a verbal portraiture, by way of memorial of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> prince, in imitation of the delineations of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> art. For I should be ashamed of myself were I not to employ my best efforts, feeble though they be and of little value, in praise of one who <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> God with such surpassing devotion. I think too that my work will be on other grounds both instructive and necessary, since it will contain a description of those royal and noble actions which are pleasing to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Sovereign of all. For would it not be disgraceful that the memory of <a href="../cathen/10752c.htm">Nero</a>, and other impious and godless tyrants far worse than he, should meet with diligent writers to embellish the relation of their worthless <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> with elegant language, and record them in voluminous histories, and that I should be silent, to whom God himself has vouchsafed such an emperor as all history records not, and has permitted me to come into his presence, and enjoy his acquaintance and society? </p>

<p>Wherefore, if it is the duty of any one, it certainly is mine, to make an ample proclamation of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> to all in whom the example of noble actions is capable of inspiring the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For some who have written the lives of worthless characters, and the history of actions but little tending to the improvement of morals, from private motives, either <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> or enmity, and possibly in some cases with no better object than the display of their own learning, have exaggerated unduly their description of actions intrinsically base, by a refinement and elegance of diction.  And thus they have become to those who by the Divine favor had been kept apart from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, teachers not of good, but of what should be silenced in oblivion and darkness. But my narrative, however unequal to the greatness of the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> it has to describe, will yet derive luster even from the bare relation of noble actions. And surely the record of conduct that has been pleasing to God will afford a far from unprofitable, indeed a most instructive study, to <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of well-disposed minds.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. That his Present Object is to record only the Pious Actions of Constantine.</h2>

<p>It is my intention, therefore, to pass over the greater part of the royal <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of this thrice-blessed prince; as, for example, his conflicts and engagements in the field, his personal valor, his victories and successes against the enemy, and the many triumphs he obtained: likewise his provisions for the interests of individuals, his legislative enactments for the social advantage of his subjects, and a multitude of other imperial labors which are fresh in the memory of all; the design of my present undertaking being to speak and write of those circumstances only which have reference to his religious character.</p>

<p>And since these are themselves of almost <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a> variety, I shall select from the facts which have come to my <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> such as are most suitable, and worthy of lasting record, and endeavor to narrate them as briefly as possible. Henceforward, indeed, there is a full and free opportunity for celebrating in every way the praises of this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> blessed prince, which hitherto we have been unable to do, on the ground that we are forbidden to judge any one blessed before his death,  because of the uncertain vicissitudes of life. Let me implore then the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and may the inspiring aid of the heavenly Word be with me, while I commence my history from the very earliest period of his life.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. That like Moses, he was reared in the Palaces of Kings.</h2>

<p>Ancient history relates that a cruel race of tyrants oppressed the Hebrew nation; and that <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who graciously regarded them in their affliction, provided that the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, who was then an infant, should be brought up in the very palaces and bosoms of the oppressors, and instructed in all the wisdom they possessed. And when in the course of time he had arrived at manhood, and the time had come for Divine <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> to avenge the wrongs of the afflicted people, then the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of a more powerful Lord, forsook the royal household, and, estranging himself in word and deed from the tyrants by whom he had been brought up, openly acknowledging his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> brethren and kinsfolk. Then <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, exalting him to be the leader of the whole nation, delivered the Hebrews from the bondage of their enemies, and inflicted Divine vengeance through his means on the tyrant race. This ancient story, though rejected by most as fabulous, has reached the ears of all. But now the same God has given to us to be eye-witnesses of <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> more wonderful than fables, and, from their recent appearance, more authentic than any report. For the tyrants of our day have ventured to <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and have sorely afflicted His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  And in the midst of these, Constantine, who was shortly to become their destroyer, but at that time of tender age, and blooming with the down of early youth, dwelt, as that other servant of God had done, in the very home of the tyrants,  but young as he was did not share the manner of life of the ungodly: for from that early period his noble nature, under the leading of the Divine Spirit, inclined him to <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> and a life acceptable to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A desire, moreover, to emulate the example of his father had its influence in stimulating the son to a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> course of conduct. His father was Constantius  (and we ought to revive his memory at this time), the most illustrious emperor of our age; of whose life it is necessary briefly to relate a few particulars, which tell to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of his son.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Of Constantius his Father, who refused to imitate Diocletian, Maximian, and Maxentius, in their Persecution of the Christians.</h2>

<p>At a time when four emperors  shared the administration of the Roman empire, Constantius alone, following a course of conduct different from that pursued by his colleagues, entered into the friendship of the Supreme God.</p>

<p>For while they besieged and wasted the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, leveling them to the ground, and obliterating the very foundations of the houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>,  he kept his hands pure from their abominable impiety, and never in any respect resembled them. They polluted their provinces by the indiscriminate slaughter of godly men and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>; but he kept his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> free from the stain of this crime.  They, involved in the mazes of impious <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, enthralled first themselves, and then all under their authority, in bondage to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, while he at the same time originated the profoundest peace throughout his dominions, and secured to his subjects the privilege of celebrating without hindrance the worship of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. In short, while his colleagues oppressed all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> by the most grievous exactions, and rendered their lives intolerable, and even worse than death, Constantius alone governed his people with a mild and tranquil sway, and exhibited towards them a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> parental and fostering care. Numberless, indeed, are the other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of this man, which are the theme of praise to all; of these I will record one or two instances, as specimens of the quality of those which I must pass by in silence, and then I will proceed to the appointed order of my narrative.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. How Constantius his Father, being reproached with Poverty by Diocletian, filled his Treasury, and afterwards restored the Money to those by whom it had been contributed.</h2>

<p>In consequence of the many reports in circulation respecting this prince, describing his kindness and gentleness of character, and the extraordinary elevation of his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, alleging too, that by reason of his extreme indulgence to his subjects, he had not even a supply of money laid up in his treasury; the emperor who at that time occupied the place of supreme power sent to reprehend his neglect of the public good, at the same time reproaching him with poverty, and alleging in <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the charge the empty state of his treasury. On this he desired the messengers of the emperor to remain with him awhile, and, calling together the wealthiest of his subjects of all nations under his dominion, he informed them that he was in want of money, and that this was the time for them all to give a <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of their affection for their prince.</p>

<p>As soon as they heard this (as though they had long been desirous of an opportunity for showing the sincerity of their good will), with <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> alacrity they filled the treasury with gold and silver and other <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>; each eager to surpass the rest in the amount of his contribution: and this they did with cheerful and joyous countenances. And now Constantius desired the messengers of the great emperor  personally to inspect his treasures, and directed them to give a faithful report of what they had seen; adding, that on the present occasion he had taken this money into his own hands, but that it had long been kept for his use in the custody of the owners, as securely as if under the charge of faithful treasurers. The ambassadors were overwhelmed with astonishment at what they had witnessed: and on their departure it is said that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> generous prince sent for the owners of the property, and, after commending them severally for their <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> loyalty, restored it all, and bade them return to their homes.</p>

<p>This one circumstance, then, conveys a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of the generosity of him whose character we are attempting to illustrate: another will contain the clearest testimony to his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Of the Persecution raised by his Colleagues.</h2>

<p>By command of the supreme authorities of the empire, the governors of the several provinces had set on foot a general <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the godly. Indeed, it was from the imperial courts themselves that the very first of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> proceeded, who passed through those conflicts for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and most readily endured both fire and sword, and the depths of the sea; every form of death, in short, so that in a brief time all the royal palaces were bereft of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men.  The result was, that the authors of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> were entirely deprived of the protecting care of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since by their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of his worshipers they at the same time silenced the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> that were wont to be made on their own behalf.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. How Constantius, feigning Idolatry, expelled those who consented to offer Sacrifice, but retained in his Palace all who were willing to confess Christ.</h2>

<p>On the other hand, Constantius conceived an expedient full of sagacity, and did a thing which sounds paradoxical, but in fact was most admirable.</p>

<p>He made a proposal to all the officers of his court, including even those in the highest stations of authority, offering them the following alternative: either that they should offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and thus be permitted to remain with him, and enjoy their usual <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a>; or, in case of refusal, that they should be shut out from all access to his person, and entirely disqualified from acquaintance and association with him. Accordingly, when they had individually made their choice, some one way and some the other; and the choice of each had been ascertained, then this admirable prince disclosed the secret meaning of his expedient, and condemned the cowardice and selfishness of the one party, while he highly commended the other for their conscientious devotion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He declared, too, that those who had been false to their God must be unworthy of the confidence of their prince; for how was it possible that they should preserve their fidelity to him, who had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> themselves faithless to a higher power? He determined, therefore, that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> should be removed altogether from the imperial court, while, on the other hand, declaring that those men who, in bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> themselves to be worthy servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, would manifest the same fidelity to their king, he entrusted them with the guardianship of his person and empire, saying that he was bound to treat such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> with special regard as his nearest and most valued friends, and to esteem them far more highly than the richest treasures.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Of his ChristianManner of Life.</h2>

<p>The father of Constantine, then, is said to have possessed such a character as we have briefly described. And what kind of death was vouchsafed to him in consequence of such devotion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and how far he whom he <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> made his lot to differ from that of his colleagues in the empire, may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to any one who will give his attention to the circumstances of the case. For after he had for a long time given many <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of royal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in acknowledging the Supreme God alone, and condemning the <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> of the ungodly, and had fortified his household by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men,  he passed the remainder of his life in remarkable repose and tranquillity, in the enjoyment of what is counted blessedness,&mdash; neither molesting others nor being molested ourselves.</p>

<p>Accordingly, during the whole course of his quiet and peaceful reign, he dedicated his entire household, his children, his wife, and domestic attendants, to the One Supreme God: so that the company assembled within the walls of his palace differed in no respect from a church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; wherein were also to be found his ministers, who offered continual supplications on behalf of their prince, and this at a time when, with most,  it was not allowable to have any dealings with the worshipers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even so far as to exchange a word with them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. That after the Abdication of Diocletian and Maximian, Constantius became Chief Augustus, and was blessed with a Numerous Offspring.</h2>

<p>The immediate consequence of this conduct was a recompense from the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, insomuch that he came into the supreme authority of the empire. For the older emperors, for some unknown reason, resigned their power; and this sudden change took place in the first year after their <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the churches. </p>

<p>From that time Constantius alone received the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> of chief Augustus, having been previously, indeed, distinguished by the diadem of the imperial C&aelig;sars,  among whom he held the first rank; but after his worth had been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> in this capacity, he was invested with the highest dignity of the Roman empire, being named chief Augustus of the four who were afterwards elected to that <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. Moreover, he surpassed most of the emperors in regard to the number of his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, having gathered around him a very large circle of children both male and female. And, lastly, when he had attained to a <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> old age, and was about to pay the common debt of nature, and exchange this life for another, God once more manifested His power in a special manner on his behalf, by providing that his eldest son Constantine should be present during his last moments, and ready to receive the imperial power from his hands. </p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Of his Son Constantine, who in his Youth accompanied Diocletian into Palestine.</h2>

<p>The latter had been with his father's imperial colleagues,  and had passed his life among them, as we have said, like God's ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>. And even in the very earliest period of his youth he was judged by them to be worthy of the highest <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. An instance of this we have ourselves seen, when he passed through Palestine with the senior emperor,  at whose right hand he stood, and commanded the admiration of all who beheld him by the indications he gave even then of royal greatness. For no one was comparable to him for <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and beauty of person, or height of stature; and he so far surpassed his compeers in personal strength as to be a terror to them. He was, however, even more conspicuous for the excellence of his mental  qualities than for his superior physical endowments; being gifted in the first place with a sound judgment,  and having also reaped the advantages of a liberal education. He was also distinguished in no ordinary degree both by natural intelligence and divinely imparted wisdom.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Flight of Constantine to his Father because of the Plots of Diocletian.</h2> 

<p>The emperors then in power, observing his manly and vigorous figure and superior <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, were moved with feelings of jealousy and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and thenceforward carefully watched for an opportunity of inflicting some brand of disgrace on his character. But the young man, being aware of their designs, the details of which, through the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, more than once came to him, sought safety in flight;  in this respect again keeping up his resemblance to the great <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. Indeed, in every sense God was his helper; and he had before ordained that he should be present in readiness to succeed his father.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Death of Constantius, who leaves his Son Constantine Emperor.</h2> 

<p><span class="sc">Immediately</span>, therefore, on his escape from the plots which had been thus insidiously laid for him, he made his way with all haste to his father, and arrived at length at the very time that he was lying at the point of death.  As soon as Constantius saw his son thus unexpectedly in his presence, he leaped from his couch, embraced him tenderly, and, declaring that the only anxiety which had troubled him in the prospect of death, namely, that caused by the absence of his son, was now removed, he rendered thanks to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, saying that he now thought death better than the longest life,  and at once completed the arrangement of his private affairs. Then, taking a final leave of the circle of sons and daughters by whom he was surrounded, in his own palace, and on the imperial couch, he bequeathed the empire, according to the law of nature,  to his eldest son, and breathed his last.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. How, after the Burial of Constantius, Constantine was Proclaimed Augustus by the Army.</h2>

<p>Nor did the imperial throne remain long unoccupied: for Constantine invested himself with his father's purple, and proceeded from his father's palace, presenting to all a renewal, as it were, in his own person, of his father's life and reign. He then conducted the funeral procession in company with his father's friends, some preceding, others following the train, and performed the last offices for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> deceased with an extraordinary degree of magnificence, and all united in honoring this thrice blessed prince with acclamations and praises, and while with one mind and voice, they <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> the rule of the son as a living again of him who was dead, they hastened at once to hail their new sovereign by the titles of Imperial and Worshipful Augustus, with joyful shouts.  Thus the memory of the deceased emperor received <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> from the praises bestowed upon his son, while the latter was pronounced <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in being the successor of such a father. All the nations also under his dominion were filled with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> and inexpressible <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> at not being even for a moment deprived of the benefits of a well ordered government.</p>

<p>In the instance of the Emperor Constantius, God has made manifest to our generation what the end of those is who in their lives have <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> and loved him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. A Brief Notice of the Destruction of the Tyrants.</h2>

<p>With respect to the other princes, who made <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I have not thought it fit in the present work to give any account of their downfall,  nor to stain the memory of the good by mentioning them in connection with those of an opposite character. The <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the facts themselves will of itself suffice for the wholesome admonition of those who have witnessed or heard of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which severally befell them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. It was by the Will of God that Constantine became possessed of the Empire.</h2>

<p>Thus then the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of all, the Supreme Governor of the whole <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, by his own will appointed Constantine, the descendant of so renowned a parent, to be prince and sovereign: so that, while others have been raised to this distinction by the election of their fellow-men, he is the only one to whose elevation no mortal may boast of having contributed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. Victories of Constantine over the Barbarians and the Britons.</h2>

<p>As soon then as he was established on the throne, he began to care for the interests of his paternal inheritance, and visited with much considerate kindness all those provinces which had previously been under his father's government. Some tribes of the barbarians who dwelt on the banks of the Rhine, and the shores of the Western ocean, having ventured to revolt, he reduced them all to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, and brought them from their savage state to one of gentleness. He contented himself with checking the inroads of others, and drove from his dominions, like untamed and savage beasts, those whom he perceived to be altogether incapable of the settled order of civilized life.  Having disposed of these affairs to his satisfaction, he directed his attention to other quarters of the world, and first passed over to the British nations,  which lie in the very bosom of the ocean. These he reduced to submission, and then proceeded to consider the state of the remaining portions of the empire, that he might be ready to tender his aid wherever circumstances might require it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. How he resolved to deliver Rome from Maxentius.</h2>

<p>While, therefore, he regarded the entire world as one immense body, and perceived that the head of it all, the royal city of the Roman empire, was bowed down by the weight of a tyrannous oppression; at first he had left the task of liberation to those who governed the other divisions of the empire, as being his superiors in point of age. But when none of these <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> able to afford relief, and those who had attempted it had experienced a disastrous termination of their enterprise,  he said that life was without enjoyment to him as long as he saw the imperial city thus afflicted, and prepared himself for the overthrowal of the tyranny.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. That after reflecting on the Downfall of those who had worshiped Idols, he made Choice of Christianity.</h2>

<p>Being convinced, however, that he needed some more powerful aid than his military forces could afford him, on account of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and magical enchantments which were so diligently practiced by the tyrant,  he sought Divine assistance, deeming the possession of arms and a numerous soldiery of secondary importance, but believing the co-operating power of Deity invincible and not to be shaken. He considered, therefore, on what God he might rely for protection and assistance. While engaged in this enquiry, the thought occurred to him, that, of the many emperors who had preceded him, those who had rested their hopes in a multitude of gods, and served them with <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and offerings, had in the first place been deceived by flattering predictions, and oracles which promised them all prosperity, and at last had met with an unhappy end, while not one of their gods had stood by to warn them of the impending <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a> of heaven; while one alone who had pursued an entirely opposite course, who had condemned their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> the one Supreme God during his whole life, had found him to be the Saviour and Protector of his empire, and the Giver of every good thing. Reflecting on this, and well weighing the fact that they who had trusted in many gods had also fallen by manifold forms of death, without leaving behind them either <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> or offspring, stock, name, or memorial among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>: while the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of his father had given to him, on the other hand, manifestations of his power and very many tokens: and considering farther that those who had already taken arms against the tyrant, and had marched to the battlefield under the protection of a multitude of gods, had met with a dishonorable end (for one of them  had shamefully retreated from the contest without a blow, and the other,  being slain in the midst of his own troops, became, as it were, the mere sport of death ); reviewing, I say, all these considerations, he judged it to be folly indeed to join in the idle worship of those who were no gods, and, after such convincing evidence, to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and therefore felt it incumbent on him to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> his father's God alone.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28. How, while he was praying, God sent him a Vision of a Cross of Light in the Heavens at Mid-day, with an Inscription admonishing him to conquer by that.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Accordingly</span> he called on him with earnest <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and supplications that he would reveal to him who he was, and stretch forth his right hand to help him in his present difficulties. And while he was thus <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a> with fervent entreaty, a most marvelous sign appeared to him from heaven, the account of which it might have been hard to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> had it been related by any other person. But since the victorious emperor himself long afterwards declared it to the writer of this history,  when he was <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> with his acquaintance and society, and confirmed his statement by an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, who could hesitate to accredit the relation, especially since the testimony of after-time has established its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? He said that about noon, when the day was already beginning to decline, he saw with his own eyes the trophy of a cross of light in the heavens, above the sun, and bearing the inscription, <span class="sc">Conquer by this</span> . At this sight he himself was struck with amazement, and his whole army also, which followed him on this expedition, and witnessed the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 29. How the Christ of God appeared to him in his Sleep, and commanded him to use in his Wars a Standard made in the Form of the Cross.</h2>

<p>He said, moreover, that he <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> within himself what the import of this apparition could be. And while he continued to ponder and reason on its meaning, night suddenly came on; then in his sleep the Christ of God appeared to him with the same sign which he had seen in the heavens, and commanded him to make a likeness of that sign which he had seen in the heavens, and to use it as a safeguard in all engagements with his enemies.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30. The Making of the Standard of the Cross.</h2>

<p>At dawn of day he arose, and communicated the marvel to his friends: and then, calling together the workers in gold and precious stones, he sat in the midst of them, and described to them the figure of the sign he had seen, bidding them represent it in gold and precious stones. And this representation I myself have had an opportunity of seeing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31. A Description of the Standard of the Cross, which the Romans now call the Labarum.</h2> 

<p>Now it was made in the following manner. A long spear, overlaid with gold, formed the figure of the cross by means of a transverse bar laid over it. On the top of the whole was fixed a wreath of gold and precious stones; and within this,  the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the Saviour's name, two letters indicating the name of Christ by means of its initial characters, the letter P being intersected by X in its centre:  and these letters the emperor was in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of wearing on his helmet at a later period. From the cross-bar of the spear was suspended a cloth,  a royal piece, covered with a profuse embroidery of most brilliant precious stones; and which, being also richly interlaced with gold, presented an indescribable degree of beauty to the beholder. This banner was of a square form, and the upright staff, whose lower section was of great length,  bore a golden half-length portrait  of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor and his children on its upper part, beneath the trophy of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and immediately above the embroidered banner.</p>

<p>The emperor constantly made use of this sign of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> as a safeguard against every adverse and hostile power, and commanded that others similar to it should be carried at the head of all his armies.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32. How Constantine received Instruction, and read the Sacred Scriptures.</h2>

<p>These things were done shortly afterwards. But at the time above specified, being struck with amazement at the extraordinary vision, and resolving to worship no other God save Him who had appeared to him, he sent for those who were acquainted with the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of His doctrines, and enquired who that God was, and what was intended by the sign of the vision he had seen. They affirmed that He was <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the only begotten Son of the one and only God: that the sign which had appeared was the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>,  and the trophy of that victory over death which He had gained in time past when sojourning on earth. They taught him also the causes of His advent, and explained to him the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> account of His <a href="../cathen/07706b.htm">incarnation</a>. Thus he was instructed in these matters, and was impressed with wonder at the divine manifestation which had been presented to his sight. Comparing, therefore, the heavenly vision with the interpretation given, he found his judgment confirmed; and, in the persuasion that the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of these things had been imparted to him by Divine teaching, he determined thenceforth to devote himself to the reading of the Inspired writings.</p>

<p>Moreover, he made the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of God his counselors, and deemed it incumbent on him to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the God who had appeared to him with all devotion. And after this, being fortified by well-grounded hopes in Him, he hastened to quench the threatening fire of tyranny.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33. Of the Adulterous Conduct of Maxentius at Rome.</h2> 

<p>For he who had tyrannically possessed himself of the imperial city,  had proceeded to great lengths in impiety and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, so as to venture without hesitation on every vile and impure action.</p>

<p>For example: he would separate <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> from their husbands, and after a time send them back to them again, and these insults he offered not to men of mean or obscure condition, but to those who held the first places in the Roman senate. Moreover, though he shamefully dishonored almost numberless free <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, he was unable to satisfy his ungoverned and intemperate desires. But  when he assayed to corrupt <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also, he could no longer secure success to his designs, since they chose rather to submit their lives  to death than yield their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to be defiled by him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34. How the Wife of a Prefect slew herself for Chastity's Sake.</h2> 

<p>Now a certain <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, wife of one of the senators who held the authority of prefect, when she understood that those who ministered to the tyrant in such matters were standing before her house (she was a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>), and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that her husband through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> had bidden them take her and lead her away, begged a short space of time for arraying herself in her usual dress, and entered her chamber. There, being left alone, she sheathed a sword in her own breast, and immediately expired, leaving indeed her dead body to the procurers, but declaring to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, both to present and future generations, by an act which spoke louder than any words, that the <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> for which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are famed is the only thing which is invincible and indestructible. Such was the conduct displayed by this <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. Massacre of the Roman People by Maxentius.</h2>

<p>All men, therefore, both people and magistrates, whether of high or low degree, trembled through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of him whose daring <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> was such as I have described, and were oppressed by his grievous tyranny. Nay, though they submitted quietly, and endured this bitter servitude, still there was no escape from the tyrant's sanguinary cruelty. For at one time, on some trifling pretense, he exposed the populace to be slaughtered by his own bodyguard; and countless multitudes of the Roman people were slain in the very midst of the city by the lances and weapons, not of Scythians or barbarians, but of their own fellow citizens. And besides this, it is impossible to calculate the number of senators whose blood was shed with a view to the seizure of their respective estates, for at different times and on various fictitious charges, multitudes of them suffered death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36. Magic Arts of Maxentius against Constantine; and Famine at Rome.</h2>

<p>But the crowning point of the tyrant's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> was his having recourse to sorcery: sometimes for magic purposes ripping up <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> with child, at other times searching into the bowels of new-born infants. He slew lions also, and practiced certain horrid arts for evoking <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and averting the approaching <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, hoping by these means to get the victory. In short, it is impossible to describe the manifold acts of oppression by which this tyrant of Rome enslaved his subjects: so that by this time they were reduced to the most extreme penury and want of necessary food, a scarcity such as our contemporaries do not remember ever before to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> at <a href="../cathen/13164a.htm">Rome</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 37. Defeat of Maxentius's Armies in Italy.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Constantine</span>, however, filled with compassion on account of all these miseries, began to arm himself with all warlike preparation against the tyranny. Assuming therefore the Supreme God as his patron, and invoking His Christ to be his preserver and aid, and setting the victorious trophy, the salutary <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, in front of his soldiers and bodyguard, he marched with his whole forces, trying to obtain again for the Romans the freedom they had inherited from their ancestors.</p>

<p>And whereas, Maxentius, trusting more in his magic arts than in the affection of his subjects, dared not even advance outside the city gates,  but had guarded every place and district and city subject to his tyranny, with large bodies of soldiers,  the emperor, confiding in the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, advanced against the first and second and third divisions of the tyrant's forces, defeated them all with ease at the first assault,  and made his way into the very interior of <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38. Death of Maxentius on the Bridge of the Tiber.</h2> 

<p>And already he was approaching very near Rome itself, when, to save him from the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of fighting with all the Romans for the tyrant's sake, God himself drew the tyrant, as it were by secret cords, a long way outside the gates.  And now those <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> recorded in Holy Writ, which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of old wrought against the ungodly (discredited by most as fables, yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> by the faithful), did he in every deed confirm to all alike, <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> and unbelievers, who were eye-witnesses of the wonders. For as once in the days of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the Hebrew nation, who were worshipers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, <q><a href="../cathen/11788c.htm">Pharaoh's</a> chariots and his host has he cast into the sea and his chosen chariot-captains are drowned in the <a href="../cathen/12688a.htm">Red Sea</a>,</q> &mdash; so at this time Maxentius, and the soldiers and guards  with him, <q>went down into the depths like stone,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note253130"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse5">Exodus&nbsp;15:5</a></span> when, in his flight before the divinely-aided forces of Constantine, he essayed to cross the river which lay in his way, over which, making a strong bridge of boats, he had framed an engine of destruction, really against himself, but in the hope of ensnaring thereby him who was beloved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For his God stood by the one to protect him, while the other, godless,  <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be the miserable contriver of these secret devices to his own ruin. So that one might well say, <q>He has made a pit, and dug it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> shall come down upon his own pate.</q>  Thus, in the present instance, under divine direction, the machine erected on the bridge, with the ambuscade concealed therein, giving way unexpectedly before the appointed time, the bridge began to sink, and the boats with the men in them went bodily to the bottom.  And first the wretch himself, then his armed attendants and guards, even as the sacred oracles had before described, <q>sank as lead in the mighty waters.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note253134"><a href="../bible/exo015.htm#verse10">Exodus&nbsp;15:10</a></span> So that they who thus obtained victory from God might well, if not in the same words, yet in fact in the same spirit as the people of his great servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, sing and speak as they did concerning the impious tyrant of old: <q>Let us sing unto the Lord, for he has been <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> exceedingly: the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea. He has become my helper and my shield unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</q> And again, <q>Who is like you, O Lord, among the gods? Who is like you, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, marvelous in praises, doing wonders?</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 39. Constantine's Entry into Rome.</h2>

<p>Having then at this time sung these and suchlike praises to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Ruler of all and the Author of victory, after the example of his great servant <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>, Constantine entered the imperial city in triumph. And here the whole body of the senate, and others of rank and distinction in the city, freed as it were from the restraint of a <a href="../cathen/12430a.htm">prison</a>, along with the whole Roman populace, their countenances expressive of the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> of their hearts, received him with acclamations and abounding <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>; men, <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, and children, with countless multitudes of servants, greeting him as deliverer, preserver, and benefactor, with incessant shouts. But he, being possessed of inward <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, was neither rendered arrogant by these plaudits, nor uplifted by the praises he heard:  but, being sensible that he had received help from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he immediately rendered a thanksgiving to him as the Author of his victory.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40. Of the Statue of Constantine holding a Cross, and its Inscription.</h2>

<p>Moreover, by loud proclamation and monumental inscriptions he made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> the salutary <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a>, setting up this great trophy of victory over his enemies in the midst of the imperial city, and expressly causing it to be engraven in indelible characters, that the salutary <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> was the safeguard of the Roman government and of the entire empire. Accordingly, he immediately ordered a lofty spear in the figure of a cross to be placed beneath the hand of a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> representing himself, in the most frequented part of Rome, and the following inscription to be engraved on it in the Latin language: <span class="sc">by virtue of this salutary sign, which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> test of valor, I have preserved and liberated your city from the yoke of tyranny. I have also set at liberty the roman senate and people, and restored them to their ancient distinction and splendor</span> . </p>

<h2>Chapter 41. Rejoicings throughout the Provinces; and Constantine's Acts of Grace.</h2>

<p>Thus the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor, glorying in the confession of the victorious cross, proclaimed the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> to the Romans with great boldness of testimony. And the inhabitants of the city, one and all, senate and people, reviving, as it were, from the pressure of a bitter and tyrannical domination, seemed to enjoy purer rays of light, and to be born again into a fresh and new life. All the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, too, as far as the limit of the western ocean, being set free from the calamities which had heretofore beset them, and gladdened by joyous festivals, ceased not to praise him as the victorious, the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>, the common benefactor: all, indeed, with one voice and one mouth, declared that Constantine had appeared by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God as a general blessing to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. The imperial edict also was everywhere published, whereby those who had been wrongfully deprived of their estates were permitted again to enjoy their own, while those who had <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> suffered exile were recalled to their homes. Moreover, he freed from imprisonment, and from every kind of danger and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, those who, by reason of the tyrant's cruelty, had been subject to these sufferings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42. The Honors Conferred upon Bishops, and the Building of Churches.</h2>

<p>The emperor also personally inviting the society of God's ministers, distinguished them with the highest possible respect and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, showing them favor in deed and word as <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to the service of his God. Accordingly, they were admitted to his table, though mean in their attire and outward appearance; yet not so in his estimation, since he thought he saw not the man as seen by the vulgar eye, but the God in him. He made them also his companions in travel, believing that He whose servants they were would thus help him. Besides this, he gave from his own private resources costly benefactions to the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, both enlarging and heightening the sacred edifices,  and embellishing the august sanctuaries  of the church with abundant offerings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43. Constantine's Liberality to the Poor.</h2>

<p>He likewise distributed money largely to those who were in need, and besides these showing himself philanthropist and benefactor even to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, who had no claim on him;  and even for the beggars in the forum, miserable and shiftless, he provided, not with money only, or necessary food, but also decent clothing. But in the case of those who had once been prosperous, and had experienced a reverse of circumstances, his aid was still more lavishly bestowed. On such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> royal spirit, he conferred magnificent benefactions; giving grants of land to some, and honoring others with various dignities. Orphans of the unfortunate he cared for as a father, while he relieved the destitution of <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widows</a>, and cared for them with special solicitude. Nay, he even gave <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>, left unprotected by their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents'</a> death, in marriage to <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealthy</a> men with whom he was personally acquainted. But this he did after first bestowing on the brides such portions as it was fitting they should bring to the communion of marriage.  In short, as the sun, when he rises upon the earth, liberally imparts his rays of light to all, so did Constantine, proceeding at early dawn from the imperial palace, and rising as it were with the heavenly luminary, impart the rays of his own beneficence to all who came into his presence. It was scarcely possible to be near him without receiving some benefit, nor did it ever happen that any who had expected to obtain his assistance were disappointed in their hope. </p>

<h2>Chapter 44. How he was present at the Synods of Bishops.</h2>

<p>Such, then, was his general character towards all. But he exercised a peculiar care over the church of God: and whereas, in the several provinces there were some who differed from each other in judgment, he, like some general <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> constituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, convened synods of his ministers. Nor did he disdain to be present and sit with them in their assembly, but bore a share in their deliberations, ministering to all that pertained to the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He took his seat, too, in the midst of them, as an individual among many, dismissing his guards and soldiers, and all whose duty it was to defend his person; but protected by the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and surrounded by the guardianship of his faithful friends. Those whom he saw inclined to a sound judgment, and exhibiting a calm and conciliatory temper, received his high approbation, for he evidently delighted in a general harmony of sentiment; while he regarded the unyielding wills with aversion. </p>

<h2>Chapter 45. His Forbearance with Unreasonable Men.</h2>

<p>Moreover he endured with patience some who were exasperated against himself, directing them in mild and gentle terms to control themselves, and not be turbulent. And some of these respected his admonitions, and desisted; but as to those who <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> incapable of sound judgment, he left them entirely at the disposal of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and never himself desired harsh measures against any one. Hence it naturally happened that the disaffected in Africa reached such a pitch of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> as even to venture on overt acts of audacity;  some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit, as it seems probable, being jealous of the present great prosperity, and impelling these men to atrocious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, that he might excite the emperor's <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> against them. He gained nothing, however, by this malicious conduct; for the emperor laughed at these proceedings, and declared their origin to be from the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one; inasmuch as these were not the actions of sober <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, but of lunatics or <a href="../cathen/04711a.htm">demoniacs</a>; who should be pitied rather than punished; since to punish madmen is as great folly as to sympathize with their condition is supreme philanthropy. </p>

<h2>Chapter 46. Victories over the Barbarians.</h2>

<p>Thus the emperor in all his actions <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Controller of all things, and exercised an unwearied  oversight over His churches. And God requited him, by subduing all barbarous nations under his feet, so that he was able everywhere to raise trophies over his enemies: and He proclaimed him as conqueror to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, and made him a terror to his adversaries: not indeed that this was his natural character, since he was rather the meekest, and gentlest, and most benevolent of men.</p>

<h2>Chapter 47. Death of Maximin, who had attempted a Conspiracy, and of Others whom Constantine detected by Divine Revelation.</h2>

<p>While he was thus engaged, the second of those who had resigned the throne, being detected in a treasonable conspiracy, suffered a most ignominious death. He was the first whose pictures, <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, and all similar marks of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and distinction were everywhere destroyed, on the ground of his crimes and impiety. After him others also of the same <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> were discovered in the act of forming secret plots against the emperor; all their intentions being miraculously revealed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> through visions to His servant.</p>

<p>For he frequently vouchsafed to him manifestations of himself, the Divine presence appearing to him in a most marvelous manner, and according to him manifold intimations of future events. Indeed, it is impossible to express in words the indescribable wonders of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">Divine grace</a> which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> was pleased to vouchsafe to His servant. Surrounded by these, he passed the rest of his life in security, rejoicing in the affection of his subjects, rejoicing too because he saw all beneath his government leading contented lives; but above all delighted at the flourishing condition of the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 48. Celebration of Constantine's Decennalia.</h2>

<p>While he was thus circumstanced, he completed the tenth year of his reign. On this occasion he ordered the celebration of general festivals, and offered <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of thanksgiving to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the King of all, as <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> without flame or smoke.  And from this employment he derived much pleasure: not so from the tidings he received of the ravages committed in the Eastern provinces.</p>

<h2>Chapter 49. How Licinius oppressed the East.</h2>

<p>For he was informed that in that quarter a certain savage beast was besetting both the church of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the other inhabitants of the provinces, owing, as it were, to the efforts of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit to produce effects quite contrary to the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor: so that the Roman empire, divided into two parts, seemed to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to resemble night and day; since darkness overspread the provinces of the East, while the brightest day illumined the inhabitants of the other portion. And whereas the latter were receiving manifold blessings at the hand of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the sight of these blessings <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> intolerable to that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> which <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> all good, as well as to the tyrant who afflicted the other division of the empire; and who, notwithstanding that his government was prospering, and he had been <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> by a marriage connection  with so great an emperor as Constantine, yet cared not to follow the steps of that <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> prince, but strove rather to imitate the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> purposes and practice of the impious; and chose to adopt the course of those whose ignominious end he had seen with his own eyes, rather than to maintain amicable relations with him who was his superior. </p>

<h2>Chapter 50. How Licinius attempted a Conspiracy against Constantine.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Accordingly</span> he engaged in an implacable <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> against his benefactor, altogether regardless of the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of friendship, the obligation of oaths, the ties of kindred, and already existing treaties. For the most benignant emperor had given him a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of sincere affection in bestowing on him the hand of his sister, thus granting him the privilege of a place in <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> relationship and his own ancient imperial descent, and investing him also with the rank and dignity of his colleague in the empire.  But the other took the very opposite course, employing himself in machinations against his superior, and devising various means to repay his benefactor with injuries. At first, pretending friendship, he did all things by guile and treachery, expecting thus to succeed in concealing his designs; but God enabled his servant to detect the schemes thus devised in darkness. Being discovered, however, in his first attempts, he had recourse to fresh frauds; at one time pretending friendship, at another claiming the protection of solemn treaties. Then suddenly violating every engagement, and again beseeching pardon by embassies, yet after all shamefully violating his word, he at last declared open <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and with desperate infatuation resolved thenceforward to carry arms against God himself, whose worshiper he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> the emperor to be.</p>

<h2>Chapter 51. Intrigues of Licinius against the Bishops, and his Prohibition of Synods.</h2>

<p>And at first he made secret enquiry respecting the ministers of God subject to his dominion, who had never, indeed, in any respect offended against his government, in order to bring false accusations against them. And when he found no ground of accusation, and had no real ground of objection against them, he next enacted a law, to the effect that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> should never on any account hold communication with each other, nor should any one of them absent himself on a visit to a neighboring church; nor, lastly, should the holding of synods, or councils for the consideration of affairs of common interest,  be permitted. Now this was clearly a pretext for displaying his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> against us. For we were compelled either to violate the law, and thus be amenable to punishment, or else, by compliance with its injunctions, to nullify the statutes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; inasmuch as it is impossible to bring important questions to a satisfactory adjustment, except by means of synods. In other cases also this God-hater, being determined to act contrary to the God-loving prince, enacted such things. For whereas the one assembled the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> them, and to promote peace and unity of judgment; the other, whose object it was to destroy everything that was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, used all his endeavors to destroy the general harmony.</p>

<h2>Chapter 52. Banishment of the Christians, and Confiscation of their Property.</h2>

<p>And whereas Constantine, the friend of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, had granted to His worshipers freedom of access to the imperial palaces; this enemy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in a spirit the very reverse of this, expelled thence all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> subject to his authority. He banished those who had <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> themselves his most faithful and devoted servants, and compelled others, on whom he had himself conferred <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and distinction as a reward for their former eminent services, to the performance of menial offices as slaves to others; and at length, being bent on seizing the property of all as a windfall for himself, he even threatened with death those who professed the Saviour's name. Moreover, being himself of a nature hopelessly debased by sensuality, and degraded by the continual practice of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and other shameless <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, he assumed his own worthless character as a specimen of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> generally, and denied that the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and continence <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 53. Edict that Women should not meet with the Men in the Churches.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Accordingly</span> he passed a second law, which enjoined that men should not appear in company with <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> in the houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and forbade <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to attend the sacred schools of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or to receive instruction from the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, directing the appointment of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> to be teachers of their own sex. These regulations being received with general ridicule, he devised other means for effecting the ruin of the churches. He ordered that the usual congregations of the people should be held in the open country outside the gates, alleging that the open air without the city was far more suitable for a multitude than the houses of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> within the walls.</p>

<h2>Chapter 54. That those who refuse to sacrifice are to be dismissed from Military Service, and those in Prison not to be fed.</h2>

<p>Failing, however, to obtain <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> in this respect also, at length he threw off the mask, and gave orders that those who held military commissions in the several cities of the empire should be deprived of their respective commands, in case of their refusal to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> to the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Accordingly the forces of the authorities in every province suffered the loss of those who worshipped <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and he too who had decreed this order suffered loss, in that he thus deprived himself of the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men. And why should I still further mention how he directed that no one should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the dictates of common humanity by distributing food to those who were pining in prisons, or should even pity the captives who perished with hunger; in short, that no one should perform a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a> action, and that those whose natural feelings impelled them to sympathize with their fellow-creatures should be prohibited from doing them a single kindness? Truly this was the most utterly shameless and scandalous of all <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and one which surpassed the worst depravity of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a>: a law which inflicted on those who showed mercy the same penalties as on those who were the objects of their compassion, and visited the exercise of mere humanity with the severest punishments. </p>

<h2>Chapter 55. The Lawless Conduct and Covetousness of Licinius.</h2>

<p>Such were the ordinances of Licinius. But why should I enumerate his innovations respecting marriage, or those concerning the dying, whereby he presumed to abrogate the ancient and wisely established <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of the Romans, and to introduce certain barbarous and cruel institutions in their stead, inventing a thousand pretenses for oppressing his subjects? Hence it was that he devised a new method of measuring land, by which he reckoned the smallest portion at more than its actual dimensions, from an insatiable desire of acquisition. Hence too he registered the names of country residents who were now no more, and had long been numbered with the dead, procuring to himself by this expedient a shameful gain. His meanness was unlimited and his rapacity insatiable. So that when he had filled all his treasuries with gold, and silver, and boundless <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a>, he bitterly bewailed his poverty, and suffered as it were the torments of Tantalus. But why should I mention how many innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> he punished with exile; how much property he confiscated; how many men of noble birth and estimable character he imprisoned, whose wives he handed over to be basely insulted by his profligate slaves, and to how many married <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a> he himself offered <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>, though already feeling the infirmities of age? I need not enlarge on these subjects, since the enormity of his last actions causes the former to appear trifling and of little moment. </p>

<h2>Chapter 56. At length he undertakes to raise a Persecution.</h2>

<p>For the final efforts of his fury appeared in his open hostility to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and he directed his attacks against the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves, whom he regarded as his worst adversaries, bearing special enmity to those men whom the great and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor treated as his friends. Accordingly he spent on us the utmost of his fury, and, being transported beyond the bounds of reason, he paused not to reflect on the example of those who had <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> before him, nor of those whom he himself had been raised up to punish and destroy for their impious <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>: nor did he heed the facts of which he had been himself a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, though he had seen with his own eyes the chief originator of these our calamities (whoever he was), smitten by the stroke of the Divine scourge.</p>

<h2>Chapter 57. That Maximian, brought Low by a Fistulous Ulcer with Worms, issued an Edict in Favor of the Christians.</h2>

<p>For whereas this man had commenced the attack on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and had been the first to pollute his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with the blood of just and godly men, a judgment from God overtook him, which at first affected his body, but eventually extended itself to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For suddenly an abscess appeared in the secret parts of his person, followed by a deeply seated fistulous ulcer; and these diseases fastened with incurable virulence on the intestines, which swarmed with a vast multitude of worms, and emitted a pestilential odor. Besides, his entire person had become loaded, through gluttonous excess, with an enormous quantity of fat, and this, being now in a putrescent state, is said to have presented to all who approached him an intolerable and dreadful spectacle. Having, therefore, to struggle against such sufferings, at length, though late, he came to a realization of his past crimes against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and, confessing his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he put a stop to the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and hastened to issue imperial edicts and rescripts for the rebuilding of their churches, at the same time enjoining them to perform their customary worship, and to offer up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> on his behalf. </p>

<h2>Chapter 58. That Maximin, who had persecutedthe Christians, was compelled to fly, and conceal himself in the Disguise of a Slave.</h2>

<p>Such was the punishment which he underwent who had commenced the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a>. He,  however, of whom we are now speaking, who had been a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of these things, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> them by his own actual experience, all at once banished the remembrance of them from his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and reflected neither on the punishment of the first, nor the divine judgment which had been executed on the second persecutor.  The latter had indeed endeavored to outstrip his predecessor in the career of crime, and prided himself on the invention of new tortures for us. Fire nor sword, nor piercing with nails, nor yet wild beasts or the depths of the sea sufficed him. In addition to all these, he discovered a new mode of punishment, and issued an edict directing that their eyesight should be destroyed. So that numbers, not of men only, but of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> and children, after being deprived of the sight of their eyes, and the use of the joints of their feet, by mutilation or cauterization, were consigned in this condition to the painful labor of the mines. Hence it was that this tyrant also was overtaken not long after by the righteous judgment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at a time when, confiding in the aid of the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> whom he worshipped as gods, and relying on the countless multitudes of his troops, he had ventured to engage in battle. For, feeling himself on that occasion destitute of all hope in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he threw from him the imperial dress which so ill became him, hid himself with unmanly timidity in the crowd around him, and sought safety in flight. </p>

<p>He afterwards lurked about the fields and villages in the <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habit</a> of a slave, hoping he should thus be effectually concealed. He had not, however, eluded the mighty and all-searching eye of God: for even while he was expecting to pass the residue of his days in security, he fell prostrate, smitten by God's fiery dart, and his whole body consumed by the stroke of Divine vengeance; so that all trace of the original lineaments of his person was lost, and nothing remained to him but dry bones and a skeleton-like appearance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 59. That Maximin, blinded by Disease, issued an Edict in Favor of the Christians.</h2>

<p>And still the stroke of God continued heavy upon him, so that his eyes protruded and fell from their sockets, leaving him quite blind: and thus he suffered, by a most righteous retribution, the very same punishment which he had been the first to devise for the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. At length, however, surviving even these sufferings, he too implored pardon of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and confessed his impious fighting against God: he too recanted, as the former persecutor had done; and by <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> and ordinances explicitly acknowledged his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in worshiping those whom he had accounted gods, declaring that he now <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, by positive experience, that the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> was the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. These were facts which Licinius had not merely received on the testimony of others, but of which he had himself had personal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: and yet, as though his understanding had been obscured by some dark cloud of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, persisted in the same <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> course.</p>
