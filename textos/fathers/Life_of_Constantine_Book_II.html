<h1>Life of Constantine (Book II)</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Secret Persecution by Licinius, who causes Some Bishops to be put to Death at Amasia of Pontus.</h2>

<p>In this manner, he of whom we have spoken continued to rush headlong towards that destruction which awaits the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and once more, with a fatal emulation of their example whose ruin he had himself witnessed as the consequence of their impious conduct, he re-kindled the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, like a long-extinguished fire, and fanned the unhallowed flame to a fiercer height than any who had gone before him.</p>

<p>At first, indeed, though breathing fury and threatenings against <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, like some savage beast of prey, or some crooked and wriggling serpent, he dared not, from <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of Constantine, openly level his attacks against the churches of God subject to his dominion; but dissembled the virulence of his <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and endeavored by secret and limited measures to compass the death of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, the most eminent of whom he found means to remove, through charges laid against them by the governors of the several provinces. And the manner in which they suffered had in it something strange, and hitherto unheard of. At all events, the barbarities perpetrated at Amasia of <a href="../cathen/12234c.htm">Pontus</a> surpassed every <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> excess of cruelty.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Demolition of Churches, and Butchery of the Bishops.</h2>

<p>For in that city some of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, for the second time since the commencement of the <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a>, were leveled with the ground, and others were closed by the governors of the several districts, in order to prevent any who frequented them from assembling together, or rendering due worship to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For he by whose orders these outrages were committed was too conscious of his own crimes to expect that these services were performed with any view to his benefit, and was convinced that all we did, and all our endeavors to obtain the favor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, were on Constantine's behalf.</p>

<p>These servile governors  then, feeling assured that such a course would be pleasing to the impious tyrant, subjected the most distinguished prelates of the churches to capital punishment. Accordingly, men who had been guilty of no crime were led away, without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>  punished like murderers: and some suffered a new kind of death, having their bodies cut piecemeal; and, after this cruel punishment, more horrible than any named in tragedy, being cast, as a food to fishes, into the depths of the sea. The result of these horrors was again, as before, the flight of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> men, and once more the fields and deserts received the worshipers of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. The tyrant, having thus far succeeded in his object, he farther determined to raise a general <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>:  and he would have accomplished his purpose, nor could anything have hindered him from carrying his resolution into effect, had not he who defends his own anticipated the coming <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and by his special guidance conducted his servant Constantine to this part of the empire, causing him to shine forth as a brilliant light in the midst of the darkness and gloomy night.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. How Constantine was stirred in Behalf of the Christiansthus in Danger of Persecution.</h2>

<p>He, perceiving the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of which he had heard to be no longer tolerable, took wise counsel, and tempering the natural clemency of his character with a certain measure of severity, hastened to succor those who were thus grievously oppressed. For he judged that it would rightly be deemed a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> task to secure, by the removal of an individual, the safety of the greater part of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. He judged too, that if he listened to the dictates of clemency only, and bestowed his pity on one utterly unworthy of it, this would, on the one hand, confer no real benefit on a man whom nothing would induce to abandon his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> practices, and whose fury against his subjects would only be likely to increase;  while, on the other hand, those who suffered from his oppression would thus be forever deprived of all hope of deliverance.</p>

<p>Influenced by these reflections, the emperor resolved without farther delay to extend a protecting hand to those who had fallen into such an extremity of distress. He accordingly made the usual warlike preparations, and assembled his whole forces, both of horse and foot. But before them all was carried the standard which I have before described, as the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of his full confidence in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. That Constantine prepared himself for the War by Prayer: Licinius by the Practice of Divination.</h2>

<p>He took with him also the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, feeling well assured that now, if ever, he stood in need of the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, and thinking it right that they should constantly be near and about his person, as most trusty guardians of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</p>

<p>Now, as soon as the tyrant understood that Constantine's victories over his enemies were secured to him by no other means than the cooperation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> above alluded to were continually with him and about his person; and besides this, that the <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of the salutary passion preceded both the emperor himself and his whole army; he regarded these precautions with ridicule (as might be expected), at the same time mocking and reviling the emperor with <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> words.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he gathered round himself <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a> and soothsayers, with sorcerers and enchanters, and the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> of those whom he imagined to be gods. He then, after offering the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> which he thought the occasion demanded, enquired how far he might reckon on a successful termination of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. They replied with one voice, that he would unquestionably be victorious over his enemies, and triumphant in the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>: and the oracles everywhere held out to him the same prospect in copious and elegant verses. The soothsayers certified him of favorable omens from the flight of birds; the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>  declared the same to be indicated by the motion of the entrails of their victims. Elevated, therefore, by these fallacious assurances, he boldly advanced at the head of his army, and prepared for battle.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. What Licinius, while sacrificing in a Grove, said concerning Idols, and concerning Christ.</h2>

<p>And when he was now ready to engage, he desired the most approved of his bodyguard  and his most valued friends to meet him in one of the places which they consider sacred. It was a well-watered and shady grove, and in it were several marble <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> of those whom he accounted to be gods. After lighting tapers and performing the usual <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of these, he is said to have delivered the following speech:</p>

<p><q>Friends and fellow-soldiers! These are our country's gods, and these we <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> with a worship derived from our remotest ancestors. But he who leads the army now opposed to us has <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> false to the religion of his forefathers, and adopted atheistic sentiments, honoring in his infatuation some strange and unheard-of Deity, with whose despicable standard he now disgraces his army, and confiding in whose aid he has taken up arms, and is now advancing, not so much against <em>us</em> as against those very gods whom he has forsaken. However, the present occasion shall prove which of us is mistaken in his judgment, and shall decide between our gods and those whom our adversaries profess to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>. For either it will declare the victory to be ours, and so most <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> evince that our gods are the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> saviours and helpers; or else, if this God of Constantine's, who comes we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whence, shall prove superior to our deities (who are many, and in point of numbers, at least, have the advantage), let no one henceforth <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> which god he ought to worship, but attach himself at once to the superior power, and ascribe to him the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> of the victory. Suppose, then, this strange <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whom we now regard with ridicule, should really prove victorious; then indeed we must acknowledge and give him <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and so bid a long farewell to those for whom we light our tapers in vain. But if our own gods triumph (as they undoubtedly will), then, as soon as we have secured the present victory, let us prosecute the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> without delay against these despisers of the gods.</q></p>

<p>Such were the words he addressed to those then present, as reported not long after to the writer of this history by some who heard them spoken.  And as soon as he had concluded his speech, he gave orders to his forces to commence the attack.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. An Apparition seen in the Cities subject to Licinius, as of Constantine's Troops passing through them.</h2>

<p>While these things were taking place a supernatural appearance is said to have been observed in the cities subject to the tyrant's rule. Different detachments of Constantine's army seemed to present themselves to the view, marching at noonday through these cities, as though they had obtained the victory. In reality, not a single soldier was anywhere present at the time, and yet this appearance was seen through the agency of a divine and superior power, and foreshadowed what was shortly coming to pass. For as soon as the armies were ready to engage, he who had broken through the ties of friendly alliance  was the first to commence the battle; on which Constantine, calling on the name of <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Supreme Saviour,</q> and giving this as the watchword to his soldiers, overcame him in this first conflict: and not long after in a second battle he gained a still more important and decisive victory, the salutary trophy preceding the ranks of his army.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. That Victory everywhere followed the Presence of the Standard of the Cross in Battle.</h2>

<p>Indeed, wherever this appeared, the enemy soon fled before his victorious troops. And the emperor perceiving this, whenever he saw any part of his forces hard pressed, gave orders that the salutary trophy should be moved in that direction, like some triumphant charm  against disasters: at which the combatants were divinely inspired, as it were, with fresh strength and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a>, and immediate victory was the result.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. That Fifty Men were selected to carry the Cross.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Accordingly</span>, he selected those of his bodyguard who were most distinguished for personal strength, valor, and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, and entrusted them with the sole care and defense of the standard. There were thus no less than fifty men whose only duty was to surround and vigilantly defend the standard, which they carried each in turn on their shoulders. These circumstances were related to the writer of this narrative by the emperor himself in his leisure moments, long after the occurrence of the events: and he added another incident well worthy of being recorded.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. That One of the Cross-Bearers, who fled from his Post, was slain: while Another, who faithfully stood his Ground, was preserved.</h2>

<p>For he said that once, during the very heat of an engagement, a sudden tumult and panic attacked his army, which threw the soldier who then bore the standard into an agony of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, so that he handed it over to another, in order to secure his own escape from the battle. As soon, however, as his comrade had received it, and he had withdrawn, and resigned all charge of the standard, he was struck in the belly by a dart, which took his life. Thus he paid the penalty of his cowardice and unfaithfulness, and lay dead on the spot: but the other, who had taken his place as the bearer of the salutary standard, found it to be the safeguard of his life. For though he was assailed by a continual shower of darts, the bearer remained unhurt, the staff of the standard receiving every weapon. It was indeed a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> marvelous circumstance, that the enemies' darts all fell within and remained in the slender circumference of this spear, and thus saved the standard-bearer from death; so that none of those engaged in this service ever received a wound.</p>

<p>This story is none of mine, but for this,  too, I am indebted to the emperor's own authority, who related it in my hearing along with other matters. And now, having thus through the power of God secured these first victories, he put his forces in motion and continued his onward march.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Various Battles, and Constantine's Victories.</h2>

<p>The van, however, of the enemy, unable to resist the emperor's first assault, threw down their arms, and prostrated themselves at his feet. All these he spared, rejoicing to save <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. But there were others who still continued in arms, and engaged in battle. These the emperor endeavored to conciliate by friendly overtures, but when these were not accepted he ordered his army to commence the attack. On this they immediately turned and betook themselves to flight; and some were overtaken and slain according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, while others fell on each other in the confusion of their flight, and perished by the swords of their comrades.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Flight, and Magic Arts of Licinius.</h2>

<p>In these circumstances their commander, finding himself bereft of the aid of his followers,  having lost his lately numerous array, both of regular and allied forces, having <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, too, by experience, how vain his confidence had been in those whom he thought to be gods, ignominiously took to flight, by which indeed he effected his escape, and secured his personal safety, for the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor had forbidden his soldiers to follow him too closely,  and thus allowed him an opportunity for escape. And this he did in the hope that he might hereafter, on conviction of the desperate state of his affairs, be induced to abandon his insane and presumptuous ambition, and return to sounder reason. So Constantine, in his excessive humanity, thought and was willing patiently to bear past injuries, and extend his forgiveness to one who so ill deserved it; but Licinius, far from renouncing his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> practices, still added crime to crime, and ventured on more daring atrocities than ever. Nay, once more tampering with the detestable arts of magic, he again was presumptuous: so that it might well be said of him, as it was of the <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egyptian</a> tyrant of old, that God had hardened his heart. <span class="stiki" id="note253172"><a href="../bible/exo009.htm#verse12">Exodus&nbsp;9:12</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 12. How Constantine, after prayingin his Tabernacle, obtained the Victory.</h2>

<p>But while Licinius, giving himself up to these impieties, rushed blindly towards the gulf of destruction, the emperor on the other hand, when he saw that he must meet his enemies in a second battle, devoted the intervening time to his Saviour. He pitched the tabernacle of the cross  outside and at a distance from his camp, and there passed his time in a pure and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> manner, offering up <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; following thus the example of his ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a>, of whom the sacred oracles testify, that he pitched the tabernacle without the camp.  He was attended only by a few, whose <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> devotion he highly esteemed. And this custom he continued to observe whenever he meditated an engagement with the enemy. For he was deliberate in his measures, the better to insure safety, and desired in everything to be directed by divine counsel. And making earnest supplications to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he was always <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> after a little with a manifestation of his presence. And then, as if moved by a divine impulse, he would rush from the tabernacle, and suddenly give orders to his army to move at once without delay, and on the instant to draw their swords. On this they would immediately commence the attack, fight vigorously, so as with incredible celerity to secure the victory, and raise trophies of victory over their enemies.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. His Humane Treatment of Prisoners.</h2>

<p>Thus the emperor and his army had long been accustomed to act, whenever there was a prospect of an engagement; for his God was ever present to his thoughts, and he desired to do everything according to his will, and conscientiously to avoid any wanton <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life. He was anxious thus for the preservation not only of his own subjects, but even of his enemies. Accordingly he directed his victorious troops to spare the lives of their prisoners, admonishing them, as <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings, not to forget the claims of their common nature. And whenever he saw the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> of his soldiery excited beyond control, he repressed their fury by a largess of money, rewarding every man who saved the life of an enemy with a certain weight of gold. And the emperor's own sagacity led him to discover this inducement to spare <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, so that great numbers even of the barbarians were thus saved, and owed their lives to the emperor's gold.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. A Farther Mention of his Prayers in the Tabernacle.</h2>

<p>Now these, and a thousand such acts as these, were familiarly and <a href="../cathen/07099b.htm">habitually</a> done by the emperor. And on the present occasion he retired, as his custom was before battle, to the privacy of his tabernacle, and there employed his time in <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Meanwhile he strictly abstained  from anything like ease, or luxurious living, and disciplined himself by <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasting</a> and bodily mortification, imploring the favor of God by supplication and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, that he might obtain his concurrence and aid, and be ready to execute whatever he might be pleased to suggest to his thoughts. In short, he exercised a vigilant care over all alike, and interceded with God as much for the safety of his enemies as for that of his own subjects.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Treacherous Friendship, and Idolatrous Practices of Licinius.</h2>

<p>And inasmuch as he who had lately fled before him now dissembled his real sentiments, and again petitioned for a renewal of friendship and alliance, the emperor thought fit, on certain conditions, to grant his request,  in the hope that such a measure might be expedient, and generally advantageous to the community. Licinius, however, while he pretended a ready submission to the terms prescribed, and attested his sincerity by oaths, at this very time was secretly engaged in collecting a military force, and again meditated <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> and strife, inviting even the barbarians to join his standard,  and he began also to look about him for other gods, having been deceived by those in whom he had hitherto trusted. And, without bestowing a thought on what he had himself publicly spoken on the subject of false deities, or choosing to acknowledge that God who had fought on the side of Constantine, he made himself ridiculous by seeking for a multitude of new gods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. How Licinius counseled his Soldiers not to attack the Standard of the Cross.</h2>

<p>Having now learned by experience the Divine and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> power which resided in the salutary trophy, by means of which Constantine's army had become habituated to victory, he admonished his soldiers never to direct their attack against this standard, nor even incautiously to allow their eyes to rest upon it; assuring them that it possessed a terrible power, and was especially hostile to him; so that they would do well carefully to avoid any collision with it. And now, having given these directions, he prepared for a decisive conflict with him whose humanity prompted him still to hesitate, and to postpone the <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a> which he foresaw awaited his adversary. The enemy, however, confident in the aid of a multitude of gods, advanced to the attack with a powerful array of military force, preceded by certain images of the dead, and lifeless <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>, as their defense. On the other side, the emperor, secure in the armor of godliness, opposed to the numbers of the enemy the salutary and life-giving sign, as at once a terror to the foe, and a protection from every harm. And for a while he paused, and preserved at first the attitude of forbearance, from respect to the treaty of peace to which he had given his sanction, that he might not be the first to commence the contest.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. Constantine's Victory.</h2>

<p>But as soon as he perceived that his adversaries persisted in their resolution, and were already drawing their swords, he gave free scope to his indignation, and by a single charge  overthrew in a moment the entire body of the enemy, thus triumphing at once over them and their gods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Death of Licinius, and Celebration of the Event.</h2>

<p>He then proceeded to deal with this adversary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and his followers according to the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, and consign them to fitting punishment. Accordingly the tyrant himself, and they whose counsels had supported him in his impiety, were together subjected to the <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> punishment of death. After this, those who had so lately been deceived by their vain confidence in false deities, acknowledged with unfeigned sincerity the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of Constantine, and openly professed their belief in him as the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and only God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Rejoicings and Festivities.</h2>

<p>And now, the impious being thus removed, the sun once more shone brightly after the gloomy cloud of tyrannic power. Each separate portion of the Roman dominion became blended with the rest; the Eastern nations united with those of the West, and the whole body of the Roman empire was graced as it were by its head in the person of a single and supreme ruler, whose sole authority pervaded the whole. Now too the bright rays of the light of godliness gladdened the days of those who had heretofore been sitting in darkness and the shadow of death. Past sorrows were no more remembered, for all united in celebrating the praises of the victorious prince, and avowed their recognition of his preserver as the only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God. Thus he whose character shone with all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, the emperor Victor, for he had himself adopted this name as a most fitting appellation to express the victory which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> had granted him over all who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> or opposed him,  assumed the dominion of the East, and thus singly governed the Roman empire, re-united, as in former times, under one head. Thus, as he was the first to proclaim to all the sole sovereignty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so he himself, as sole sovereign of the Roman world, extended his authority over the whole <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>. Every apprehension of those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> under the pressure of which all had suffered was now removed; men whose heads had drooped in sorrow now regarded each other with smiling countenances, and looks expressive of their inward <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>. With processions and <a href="../cathen/07595a.htm">hymns</a> of praise they first of all, as they were told, ascribed the supreme sovereignty to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the King of kings; and then with continued acclamations rendered <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to the victorious emperor, and the C&aelig;sars, his most discreet and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> sons. The former afflictions were forgotten, and all past impieties forgiven: while with the enjoyment of present <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> was mingled the expectation of continued blessings in the future.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Constantine's Enactments in Favor of the Confessors.</h2>

<p>Moreover, the emperor's edicts, permeated with his humane spirit, were published among us also, as they had been among the inhabitants of the other division of the empire; and his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, which breathed a spirit of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> toward <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, gave promise of manifold blessings, since they secured many advantages to his provincial subjects in every nation, and at the same time prescribed measures suited to the exigencies of the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For first of all they recalled those who, in consequence of their refusal to join in idol worship, had been driven to exile, or ejected from their homes by the governors of their respective provinces. In the next place, they relieved from their burdens those who for the same reason had been adjudged to serve in the civil courts, and ordained restitution to be made to any who had been deprived of property. They too, who in the time of trial had signalized themselves by <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and had therefore been condemned to the painful labor of the mines, or consigned to the solitude of islands, or compelled to toil in the public works, all received an immediate release from these burdens; while others, whose religious constancy had cost them the forfeiture of their military rank, were vindicated by the emperor's generosity from this dishonor: for he granted them the alternative either of resuming their rank, and enjoying their former privileges, or, in the event of their preferring a more settled life, of perpetual exemption from all service. Lastly, all who had been compelled by way of disgrace and insult to serve in the employments of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>,  he likewise freed with the rest.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. His Laws concerning Martyrs, and concerning Ecclesiastical Property.</h2>

<p>Such were the benefits secured by the emperor's written mandates to the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of those who had thus suffered for the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and his <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> made ample provision for their property also.</p>

<p>With regard to those <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a> of God who had laid down their lives in the confession of His name, he directed that their estates should be enjoyed by their nearest kindred; and, in default of any of these, that the right of inheritance should be vested in the churches. Farther, whatever property had been consigned to other parties from the treasury, whether in the way of sale or gift, together with that retained in the treasury itself, the generous mandate of the emperor directed should be restored to the original owners. Such benefits did his bounty, thus widely diffused, confer on the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. How he won the Favor of the People.</h2>

<p>But his munificence bestowed still further and more numerous favors on the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> peoples and the other nations of his empire. So that the inhabitants of our [Eastern] regions, who had heard of the privileges experienced in the opposite portion of the empire, and had blessed the fortunate recipients of them, and longed for the enjoyment of a similar lot for themselves, now with one consent proclaimed their own <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>, when they saw themselves in possession of all these blessings; and confessed that the appearance of such a monarch to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> was indeed a marvelous event, and such as the world's history had never yet recorded. Such were their sentiments.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. That he declared God to be the Author of his Prosperity: and concerning his Rescripts.</h2>

<p>And now that, through the powerful aid of God his Saviour, all nations owned their subjection to the emperor's authority, he openly proclaimed to all the name of Him to whose bounty he owed all his blessings, and declared that He, and not himself, was the author of his past victories. This declaration, written both in the Latin and Greek languages, he caused to be transmitted through every province of the empire. Now the excellence of his style of expression  may be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from a perusal of his letters themselves which were two in number; one addressed to the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the other to the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> population in the several cities of the empire. The latter of these I think it well to insert here as connected with my present subject, in order on the one hand that a copy of this document may be recorded as matter of history, and thus preserved to posterity, and on the other that it may serve to confirm the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of my present narrative. It is taken from an authentic copy of the imperial statute in my own possession and the signature in the emperor's own handwriting attaches as it were the impress of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to the statement I have made.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Law of Constantine respecting Piety towards God, and the ChristianReligion.</h2> 

<p><span class="sc">Victor Constantinus, Maximus Augustus</span>, to the inhabitants of the province of Palestine.</p>

<p>To all who entertain just and sound sentiments respecting the character of the Supreme Being, it has long been most clearly evident, and beyond the possibility of <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, how vast a difference there has ever been between those who maintain a careful observance of the hallowed duties of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian religion</a>, and those who treat this religion with hostility or contempt. But at this present time, we may see by still more manifest <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, and still more decisive instances, both how unreasonable it were to question this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and how mighty is the power of the Supreme God: since it appears that they who faithfully observe His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, and shrink from the transgression of His commandments, are rewarded with abundant blessings, and are endued with well-grounded hope as well as ample power for the accomplishment of their undertakings. On the other hand, they who have cherished impious sentiments have experienced results corresponding to their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> choice. For how is it to be expected that any blessing would be obtained by one who neither desired to acknowledge nor duly to worship that God who is the source of all blessing? Indeed, facts themselves are a confirmation of what I say.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. An Illustration from Ancient Times.</h2>

<p>For certainly any one who will mentally retrace the course of events from the earliest period down to the present time, and will reflect on what has occurred in past ages, will find that all who have made <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> and probity the basis of their conduct, have not only carried their undertakings to a successful issue, but have gathered, as it were, a store of sweet fruit as the produce of this pleasant root. Again, whoever observes the career of those who have been bold in the practice of oppression or <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>; who have either directed their senseless fury against God himself, or have conceived no kindly feelings towards their fellow-men, but have dared to afflict them with exile, disgrace, confiscation, massacre, or other miseries of the like kind, and all this without any sense of compunction, or wish to direct thoughts to a better course, will find that such men have received a recompense proportioned to their crimes. And these are results which might naturally and reasonably be expected to ensue. </p>

<h2>Chapter 26. Of Persecuted and Persecutors.</h2>

<p>For whoever have addressed themselves with integrity of purpose to any course of action, keeping the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God continually before their thoughts, and preserving an unwavering <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in him, without allowing present fears or dangers to outweigh their hope of future blessings&mdash; such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, though for a season they may have experienced painful trials, have borne their afflictions lightly, being supported by the belief of greater rewards in store for them; and their character has acquired a brighter luster in proportion to the severity of their past sufferings. With regard, on the other hand, to those who have either dishonorably slighted the principles of <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, or refused to acknowledge the Supreme God themselves, and yet have dared to subject others who have faithfully maintained his worship to the most cruel insults and punishments; who have failed equally to recognize their own wretchedness in oppressing others on such grounds, and the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> and blessing of those who preserved their devotion to God even in the midst of such sufferings: with regard, I say, to such men, many a time have their armies been slaughtered, many a time have they been put to flight; and their warlike preparations have ended in total ruin and defeat.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27. How the Persecution became the Occasion of Calamities to the Aggressors.</h2>

<p>From the causes I have described, grievous <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> arose, and destructive devastations. Hence followed a scarcity of the common necessaries of life, and a crowd of consequent miseries: hence, too, the authors of these impieties have either met a disastrous death of extreme suffering, or have dragged out an ignominious <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and confessed it to be worse than death itself, thus receiving as it were a measure of punishment proportioned to the heinousness of their crimes.  For each experienced a degree of calamity according to the blind fury with which he had been led to combat, and as he thought, defeat the Divine will: so that they not only felt the pressure of the ills of this present life, but were tormented also by a most lively apprehension of punishment in the future world. </p>

<h2>Chapter 28. That God chose Constantine to be the Minister of Blessing.</h2>

<p>And now, with such a mass of impiety oppressing the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, and the commonwealth in danger of being utterly destroyed, as if by the agency of some pestilential disease, and therefore needing powerful and effectual aid; what was the relief, and what the remedy which the Divinity devised for these <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>? (And by Divinity is meant the one who is alone and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the possessor of almighty and <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> power: and surely it cannot be deemed arrogance in one who has received benefits from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to acknowledge them in the loftiest terms of praise.) I myself, then, was the instrument whose services He chose, and esteemed suited for the accomplishment of his will. Accordingly, beginning at the remote Britannic ocean, and the regions where, according to the law of nature, the sun sinks beneath the horizon, through the aid of divine power I banished and utterly removed every form of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which prevailed, in the hope that the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, enlightened through my instrumentality, might be recalled to a due observance of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and at the same time our most blessed <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> might prosper under the guidance of his almighty hand.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29. Constantine's Expressions of Piety towards God; and Praise of the Confessors.</h2>

<p>I said,  under the guidance of his hand; for I would desire never to be forgetful of the gratitude due to his <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. Believing, therefore, that this most excellent service had been confided to me as a special gift, I proceeded as far as the regions of the East, which, being under the pressure of severer calamities, seemed to demand still more effectual remedies at my hands. At the same time I am most certainly persuaded that I myself owe my life, my every breath, in short, my very inmost and secret thoughts, entirely to the favor of the Supreme God. Now I am well aware that they who are sincere in the pursuit of the heavenly hope, and have fixed this hope in heaven itself as the peculiar and predominant principle of their lives, have no need to depend on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> favor, but rather have enjoyed higher <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> in proportion as they have separated themselves from the inferior and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> things of this earthly <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. Nevertheless I deem it incumbent on me to remove at once and most completely from all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> the hard necessities laid upon them for a season, and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> inflictions under which they have suffered, though free from any guilt or just liability. For it would be strange indeed, that the <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> and constancy of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> displayed by such men should be fully apparent during the reign of those whose first object it was to <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecute</a> them on account of their devotion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and yet that the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of their character should not be more bright and blessed, under the administration of a prince who is His servant.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30. A Law granting Release from Exile, from Service in the Courts, and from the Confiscation of Property.</h2>

<p>Let all therefore who have exchanged their country for a foreign land, because they would not abandon that reverence and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> toward God to which they had devoted themselves with their whole hearts, and have in consequence at different times been subject to the cruel sentence of the courts; together with any who have been enrolled in the registers of the public courts though in time past exempt from such office; let these, I say, now render thanks to God the Liberator of all, in that they are restored to their hereditary property, and their wonted tranquility. Let those also who have been despoiled of their goods, and have hitherto passed a wretched <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, mourning under the loss of all that they possessed, once more be restored to their former homes, their <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, and estates, and receive with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> the bountiful kindness of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31. Release likewise granted to Exiles in the Islands.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Furthermore</span>, it is our command that all those who have been detained in the islands against their will should receive the benefit of this present provision; in order that they who till now have been surrounded by rugged mountains and the encircling barrier of the ocean, being now set free from that gloomy and desolate solitude, may fulfill their fondest wish by revisiting their dearest friends. Those, too, who have prolonged a miserable life in the midst of abject and wretched squalor, welcoming their restoration as an unlooked-for gain, and discarding henceforth all anxious thoughts, may pass their lives with us in freedom from all <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For that any one could live in a state of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> under our government, when we boast and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> ourselves to be the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, would surely be a thing most extraordinary even to hear of, and quite incredible; and our mission is to rectify the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of the others.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32. And to those ignominiously employed in the Mines and Public Works.</h2>

<p>Again, with regard to those who have been condemned either to the grievous labor of the mines, or to service in the public works, let them enjoy the sweets of leisure in place of these long-continued toils, and henceforth lead a far easier life, and more accordant with the wishes of their hearts, exchanging the incessant hardships of their tasks for quiet relaxation. And if any have forfeited the common privilege of liberty, or have unhappily suffered dishonor,  let them hasten back every one to the country of his nativity, and resume with becoming <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> their former positions in society, from which they have been as it were separated by long residence abroad.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33. Concerning those Confessors engaged in Military Service.</h2>

<p>Once more, with respect to those who had previously been preferred to any military distinction, of which they were afterwards deprived, for the cruel and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> reason that they chose rather to acknowledge their allegiance to God than to retain the rank they held; we leave them perfect liberty of choice, either to occupy their former stations, should they be content again to engage in military service, or after an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> discharge, to live in undisturbed tranquillity. For it is fair and consistent that men who have displayed such magnanimity and <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">fortitude</a> in meeting the perils to which they have been exposed, should be allowed the choice either of enjoying peaceful leisure, or resuming their former rank.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34. The Liberation of Free Persons condemned to labor in the Women's Apartments, or to Servitude.</h2>

<p>Lastly, if any have wrongfully been deprived of the privileges of noble lineage, and subjected to a judicial sentence which has consigned them to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> apartments  and to the linen making, there to undergo a cruel and miserable labor, or reduced them to servitude for the benefit of the public treasury, without any exemption on the ground of superior birth; let such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, resuming the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> they had previously enjoyed, and their proper dignities, henceforward exult in the blessings of liberty, and lead a glad life. Let the free man,  too, by some <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a> and inhumanity, or even <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, made a slave, who has felt the sudden transition from liberty to bondage, and ofttimes bewailed his unwonted labors, return to his <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> once more a free man in virtue of this our ordinance, and seek those employments which befit a state of freedom; and let him dismiss from his remembrance those services which he found so oppressive, and which so ill became his condition.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35. Of the Inheritance of the Property of Martyrs and Confessors, also of those who had suffered Banishment or Confiscation of Property.</h2>

<p>Nor must we omit to notice those estates of which individuals have been deprived on various pretenses. For if any of those who have engaged with dauntless and resolute determination in the noble and divine conflict of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> have also been stripped of their fortunes; or if the same has been the lot of the confessors, who have won for themselves the hope of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> treasures; or if the loss of property has befallen those who were driven from their native land because they would not yield to the persecutors, and betray their <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; lastly, if any who have escaped the sentence of death have yet been despoiled of their worldly goods; we ordain that the inheritances of all such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> be transferred to their nearest kindred. And whereas the <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> expressly assign this right to those most nearly related, it will be easy to ascertain to whom these inheritances severally belong. And it is evidently reasonable that the succession in these cases should belong to those who would have stood in the place of nearest affinity, had the deceased experienced a natural death.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36. The Church is declared Heir of those who leave no Kindred; and the Free Gifts of such Persons Confirmed.</h2>

<p>But should there be no surviving relation to succeed in due course to the property of those above-mentioned, I mean the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, or confessors, or those who for some such <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> have been banished from their native land; in such cases we ordain that the church locally nearest in each instance shall succeed to the inheritance. And surely it will be no wrong to the departed that that church should be their heir, for whose sake they have endured every extremity of suffering. We think it necessary to add this also, that in case any of the above-mentioned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have donated any part of their property in the way of free gift, possession of such property shall be assured, as is reasonable, to those who have thus received it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37 . Lands, Gardens, or Houses, but not Actual Produce from them, are to be given back.</h2>

<p>And that there may be no obscurity in this our ordinance, but every one may readily apprehend its requirements, let all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> hereby <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that if they are now maintaining themselves in possession of a piece of land, or a house, or garden, or anything else which had appertained to the before-mentioned <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, it will be good and advantageous for them to acknowledge the fact, and make restitution with the least possible delay. On the other hand, although it should appear that some individuals have reaped abundant profits from this <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> possession, we do not consider that <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> demands the restitution of such profits. They must, however, declare explicitly what amount of benefit they have thus derived, and from what sources, and entreat our pardon for this offense; in order that their past <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> may in some measure be atoned for, and that the Supreme God may accept this compensation as a token of contrition, and be pleased graciously to pardon the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38. In what Manner Requests should be made for these.</h2>

<p>But it is possible that those who have become masters of such property (if it be right or possible to allow them such a title) will assure us by way of apology for their conduct, that it was not in their power to abstain from this appropriation at a time when a spectacle of misery in all its forms everywhere met the view; when men were cruelly driven from their homes, slaughtered without mercy, thrust forth without remorse: when the confiscation of the property of innocent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> was a common thing, and when <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and property seizures were unceasing. If any defend their conduct by such reasons as these, and still persist in their avaricious temper, they shall be made sensible that such a course will bring punishment on themselves, and all the more because this correction of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is the very characteristic of our service to the Supreme God. So that it will henceforth be dangerous to retain what dire necessity may in time past have compelled men to take; especially because it is in any case incumbent on us to discourage <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> desires, both by persuasion, and by warning examples.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39. The Treasury must restore Lands, Gardens, and Houses to the Churches.</h2>

<p>Nor shall the treasury itself, should it have any of the things we have spoken of, be permitted to keep them; but, without venturing as it were to raise its voice against the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches, it shall <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> relinquish in their favor what it has for a time <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a> retained. We ordain, therefore, that all things whatsoever which shall appear righteously to belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, whether the property consist of houses or fields and gardens, or whatever the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of it may be, shall be restored in their full value and integrity, and with undiminished right of possession.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40. The Tombs of Martyrs and the Cemeteries to be transferred to the Possession of the Churches.</h2>

<p>Again, with respect to those places which are <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> in being the depositories of the remains of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and continue to be memorials of their <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> departure; how can we <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they rightly belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, or refrain from issuing our injunction to that effect? For surely there can be no better liberality, no labor more pleasing or profitable, than to be thus employed under the guidance of the Divine Spirit, in order that those things which have been appropriated on false pretenses by <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, may be restored, as <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> demands, and once more secured to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> churches.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41. Those who have purchased Property belonging to the Church, or received it as a Gift, are to restore it.</h2>

<p>And since it would be wrong in a provision intended to include all cases, to pass over those who have either procured any such property by right of purchase from the treasury, or have retained it when conveyed to them in the form of a gift; let all who have thus rashly indulged their insatiable thirst of gain be assured that, although by daring to make such purchases they have done all in their power to alienate our clemency from themselves, they shall nevertheless not fail of obtaining it, so far as is possible and consistent with propriety in each case. So much then is determined.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42. An Earnest Exhortation to worship God.</h2>

<p>And now, since it appears by the clearest and most convincing evidence, that the miseries which erewhile oppressed the entire <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> are now banished from every part of the world, through the power of Almighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and at the same time the counsel and aid which he is pleased on many occasions to administer through our agency; it remains for all, both individually and unitedly, to observe and seriously consider how great this power and how efficacious this <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> are, which have annihilated and utterly destroyed this generation, as I may call them, of most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men; have restored <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to the good, and diffused it over all countries; and now guarantee the fullest authority both to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> the Divine law as it should be <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>, with all reverence, and pay due observance to those who have dedicated themselves to the service of that law. These rising as from some dark abyss and, with an enlightened <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the present course of events, will henceforward render to its precepts that becoming reverence and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> which are consistent with their <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> character.</p>

<p>Let this ordinance be published in our Eastern provinces. </p>

<h2>Chapter 43. How the Enactments of Constantine were carried into Effect.</h2>

<p>Such were the injunctions contained in the first letter which the emperor addressed to us. And the provisions of this enactment were speedily carried into effect, everything being conducted in a manner quite different from the atrocities which had but lately been daringly perpetrated during the cruel ascendancy of the tyrants. Those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> also who were legally entitled to it, received the benefit of the emperor's liberality.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44. That he promoted Christiansto Offices of Government, and forbade Gentilesin Such Stations to offer Sacrifice.</h2>

<p>After this the emperor continued to address himself to matters of high importance, and first he sent governors to the several provinces, mostly such as were devoted to the saving <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and if any appeared inclined to adhere to Gentile worship, he forbade them to offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. This law applied also to those who surpassed the provincial governors in rank and dignity,  and even to those who occupied the highest station, and held the authority of the Pr&aelig;torian Pr&aelig;fecture.  If they were <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, they were free to act consistently with their profession; if otherwise, the law required them to abstain from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45. Statutes which forbade Sacrifice, and enjoined the Building of Churches.</h2>

<p>Soon after this, two <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> were promulgated about the same time; one of which was intended to restrain the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> abominations which in time past had been practiced in every city and country; and it provided that no one should erect images, or practice <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">divination</a> and other false and foolish arts, or offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> in any way.  The other statute commanded the heightening of the <a href="../cathen/11271a.htm">oratories</a>, and the enlargement in length and breadth of the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; as though it were expected that, now the <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> of <a href="../cathen/12223b.htm">polytheism</a> was wholly removed, pretty nearly all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> would henceforth attach themselves to the service of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. His own personal <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> induced the emperor to devise and write these instructions to the governors of the several provinces: and the law farther admonished them not to spare the expenditure of money, but to draw supplies from the imperial treasury itself. Similar instructions were written also to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the several churches; and the emperor was pleased to transmit the same to myself, being the first letter which he personally addressed to me.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46. Constantine's Letter to Eusebius and Other Bishops, respecting the Building of Churches, with Instructions to repair the Old, and erect New Ones on a Larger Scale, with the Aid of the Provincial Governors.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Victor Constantinus, Maximus Augustus</span>, to Eusebius.</p>

<p>Forasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a> and willful rule of tyranny has <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the servants of our Saviour until this present time, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> and have fully satisfied myself, best beloved brother, that the buildings belonging to all the churches have either become ruinous through actual neglect, or have received inadequate attention from the dread of the violent spirit of the times.</p>

<p>But now, that liberty is restored, and that serpent  driven from the administration of public affairs by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and our instrumentality, we trust that all can see the efficacy of the Divine power, and that they who through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> or through unbelief have fallen into any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, will now acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and adopt in future that course of life which is according to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and rectitude. With respect, therefore, to the churches over which you yourself preside, as well as the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a> of other churches with whom you are acquainted, do you admonish all to be <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> in their attention to the buildings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">churches</a>, and either to repair or enlarge those which at present exist, or, in cases of necessity, to erect new ones.</p>

<p><q>We also empower you, and the others through you, to demand what is needful for the work, both from the provincial governors and from the Pr&aelig;torian Pr&aelig;fect. For they have received instructions to be most diligent in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to your Holiness's orders. God preserve you, beloved brother.</q> A copy of this charge was transmitted throughout all the provinces to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the several churches: the provincial governors received directions accordingly, and the imperial statute was speedily carried into effect.</p>

<h2>Chapter 47. That he wrote a Letter in Condemnation of Idolatry.</h2>

<p>Moreover, the emperor, who continually made progress in <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, dispatched an admonitory letter to the inhabitants of every province, respecting the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> into which his predecessors in power had fallen, in which he eloquently exhorts his subjects to acknowledge the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and openly to profess their allegiance to his Christ as their Saviour. This letter also, which is in his own handwriting, I have judged it necessary to translate from the Latin for the present work, in order that we may hear, as it were, the voice the emperor himself uttering these sentiments in the audience of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 48. Constantine's Edict to the People of the Provinces concerning the Error of Polytheism, commencing with Some General Remarks on Virtue and Vice.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Victor Constantinus, Maximus Augustus</span>, to the people of the Eastern provinces.</p>

<p>Whatever is comprehended under the sovereign  <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> of nature, seems to convey to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> an adequate idea of the forethought and intelligence of the divine order. Nor can any, whose minds are directed in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> path of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> to the attainment of that end, entertain a <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the just perceptions of sound reason, as well as those of the natural vision itself, through the sole influence of genuine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, lead to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Accordingly no wise man will ever be surprised when he sees the mass of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> influenced by opposite sentiments. For the beauty of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> would be useless  and unperceived, did not <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> display in contrast with it the course of perversity and folly. Hence it is that the one is crowned with reward, while the most high God is himself the administrator of judgment to the other.</p>

<p>And now I will endeavor to lay before you all as explicitly as possible, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of my own hopes of future <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 49. Concerning Constantine's Pious Father, and the Persecutors Diocletian and Maximian.</h2>

<p>The former emperors I have been accustomed to regard as those with whom I could have no sympathy,  on account of the savage cruelty of their character. Indeed, my father was the only one who uniformly practiced the duties of humanity, and with admirable <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> called for the blessing of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father on all his actions, but the rest, unsound in <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, were more <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> of cruel than gentle measures; and this disposition they indulged without restraint, and thus <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuted</a> the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine during the whole period of their reign. Nay, so violent did their malicious fury become, that in the midst of a profound peace, as regards both the religious and ordinary interests of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they kindled, as it were, the flames of a civil <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 50. That the Persecution originated on Account of the Oracle of Apollo, who, it was said, could not give Oracles because of <q>the Righteous Men.</q></h2>

<p>About that time it is said that Apollo spoke from a deep and gloomy cavern, and through the medium of no <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> voice, and declared that <em>the righteous men</em> on earth were a bar to his speaking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and accordingly that the oracles from the tripod were fallacious. Hence it was that he suffered his tresses to droop in token of grief,  and mourned the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which the loss of the oracular spirit would entail on <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>. But let us mark the consequences of this.</p>

<h2>Chapter 51. That Constantine, when a Youth, heard from him who wrote the Persecution Edict that <q>the Righteous Men</q> were the Christians.</h2>

<p>I call now on you, most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that, when young, I heard him who at that time was chief among the Roman emperors, unhappy, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> unhappy as he was, and laboring under mental delusion, make earnest enquiry of his attendants as to who these righteous ones on earth were, and that one of the Pagan <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> then present replied that they were doubtless the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. This answer he eagerly received, like some honeyed draught, and unsheathed the sword which was ordained for the punishment of crime, against those whose <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> was beyond reproach. Immediately, therefore, he issued those sanguinary edicts, traced, if I may so express myself, with a sword's point dipped in blood; at the same time commanding his judges to tax their ingenuity for the invention of new and more terrible punishments.</p>

<h2>Chapter 52. The Manifold Forms of Torture and Punishment practiced against the Christians.</h2>

<p>Then, indeed, one might see with what arrogance those venerable worshipers of God were daily exposed, with continued and relentless cruelty, to outrages of the most grievous kind, and how that modesty of character  which no enemy had ever treated with disrespect, became the mere sport of their infuriated fellow citizens. Is there any punishment by fire, are there any tortures or forms of torment, which were not applied to all, without distinction of age or sex? Then, it may be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> said, the earth shed tears, the all-encircling compass of heaven mourned because of the pollution of blood; and the very light of day itself was darkened in grief at the spectacle.</p>

<h2>Chapter 53. That the Barbarians kindly received the Christians.</h2>

<p>But what is the consequence of this? Why, the barbarians themselves may boast now of the contrast their conduct presents to these creel <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; for they received and kept in gentlest captivity those who then fled from among us, and secured to them not merely safety from danger, but also the free exercise of their <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> religion. And now the Roman people bear that lasting stain which the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, at that time driven from the Roman world, and taking refuge with the barbarians, have branded on them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 54. What Vengeance overtook those who on Account of the Oracle raised the Persecution.</h2>

<p>But why need I longer dwell on these lamentable events, and the general sorrow which in consequence pervaded the world? The perpetrators of this dreadful guilt are now no more: they have experienced a miserable end, and are consigned to unceasing punishment in the depths of the lower world. They encountered each other in civil strife, and have left neither name nor race behind. And surely this calamity would never have befallen them, had not that impious deliverance of the Pythian oracle exercised a delusive power over them. </p>

<h2>Chapter 55. Constantine gives Glory to God, makes Grateful Acknowledgment of the Sign of the Cross, and prays for the Churches and People.</h2>

<p>And now I beseech you, most mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be merciful and gracious to your Eastern nations, to your people in these provinces, worn as they are by protracted miseries; and grant them healing through your servant. Not without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, do I prefer this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> to you, the Lord of all. Under your guidance have I devised and accomplished measures fraught with blessings: preceded by your sacred sign I have led your armies to victory: and still, on each occasion of public danger, I follow the same <a href="../cathen/14373b.htm">symbol</a> of your perfections while advancing to meet the foe. Therefore have I dedicated to your service a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> duly attempered by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>. For your name I <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, while I regard with reverence that power of which you have given abundant <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, to the confirmation and increase of my <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. I hasten, then, to devote all my powers to the restoration of your most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> dwelling-place, which those profane and impious men have defiled by the contamination of <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 56. He prays that All may be Christians, but compels None.</h2>

<p>My own desire is, for the common good of the world and the advantage of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, that your people should enjoy a life of peace and undisturbed concord. Let those, therefore, who still delight in <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, be made welcome to the same degree of peace and tranquillity which they have who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. For it may be that this restoration of equal privileges to all will prevail to lead them into the straight path. Let no one molest another, but let every one do as his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> desires. Only let men of sound judgment be assured of this, that those only can live a life of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and purity, whom you call to a reliance  on your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. With regard to those who will hold themselves aloof from us, let them have, if they please, their temples  of lies: <em>we</em> have the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> edifice of your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which you have given us as our native home.  We <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, however, that they too may receive the same blessing, and thus experience that heartfelt <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> which unity of sentiment inspires.</p>

<h2>Chapter 57. He gives Glory to God, who has given Light by his Son to those who were in Error.</h2>

<p>And <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> our worship is no new or recent thing, but one which you have ordained for your own due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, from the time when, as we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, this system of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> was first established. And, although <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> have deeply fallen, and have been seduced by manifold <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a>, yet have you revealed a pure light in the person of your Son, that the power of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> should not utterly prevail, and hast thus given testimony to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> concerning yourself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 58. He glorifies him again for his Government of the Universe.</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of this is assured to us by your works. It is your power which removes our guilt, and makes us faithful. The sun and the moon have their settled course. The stars move in no uncertain orbits round this terrestrial globe. The revolution of the seasons recurs according to unerring <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>. The solid fabric of the earth was established by your word: the winds receive their impulse at appointed times; and the course of the waters continues with ceaseless flow,  the ocean is circumscribed by an immovable barrier, and whatever is comprehended within the compass of earth and sea, is all contrived for wondrous and important ends.</p>

<p>Were it not so, were not all regulated by the determination of your will, so great a diversity, so manifold a division of power, would unquestionably have brought ruin on the whole race and its affairs. For those agencies which have maintained a mutual strife  would thus have carried to a more deadly length that hostility against the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> which they even now exercise, though unseen by mortal eyes.</p>

<h2>Chapter 59. He gives Glory to God, as the Constant Teacher of Good.</h2>

<p>Abundant thanks, most mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and Lord of all, be rendered to you, that, by so much as our nature becomes <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> from the diversified pursuits of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, by so much the more are the precepts of your divine doctrine confirmed to those whose thoughts are directed aright, and who are sincerely devoted to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. As for those who will not allow themselves to be cured of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, let them not attribute this to any but themselves. For that remedy which is of sovereign and healing <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is openly placed within the reach of all. Only let not any one inflict an injury on that religion which experience itself testifies to be pure and undefiled. Henceforward, therefore, let us all enjoy in common the privilege placed within our reach, I mean the blessing of peace, endeavoring to keep our <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> pure from all that is contrary.</p>

<h2>Chapter 60. An Admonition at the Close of the Edict, that No One should trouble his Neighbor.</h2>

<p>Once more, let none use that to the detriment of another which he may himself have received on conviction of its <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but let every one, if it be possible, apply what he has understood and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the benefit of his neighbor; if otherwise, let him relinquish the attempt. For it is one thing voluntarily to undertake the conflict for <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, another to compel others to do so from the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of punishment.</p>

<p><q>These are our words; and we have enlarged on these topics more than our ordinary clemency would have dictated, because we were unwilling to dissemble or be false to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; and the more so, since we understand there are some who say that the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> temples, and the power of darkness, have been entirely removed. We should indeed have earnestly recommended such removal to all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, were it not that the rebellious spirit of those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> still continues obstinately fixed in the minds of some, so as to discourage the hope of any general restoration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> to the ways of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 61. How Controversies originated at Alexandria through Matters relating to Arius.</h2> 

<p>In this manner the emperor, like a powerful herald of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, addressed himself by his own letter to all the provinces, at the same time warning his subjects against superstitious  <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and encouraging them in the pursuit of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> godliness. But in the midst of his joyful anticipations of the success of this measure, he received tidings of a most serious disturbance which had invaded the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. This intelligence he heard with deep concern, and at once endeavored to devise a remedy for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. The origin of this disturbance may be thus described. The people of God were in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> flourishing state, and abounding in the practice of good works. No terror from without assailed them, but a bright and most profound peace, through the favor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, encompassed his Church on every side. Meantime, however, the spirit of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> was watching to destroy our blessings, which at first crept in unperceived, but soon revelled in the midst of the assemblies of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. At length it reached the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> themselves, and arrayed them in <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> hostility against each other, on pretense of a jealous regard for the doctrines of Divine <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Hence it was that a mighty fire was kindled as it were from a little spark, and which, originating in the first instance in the <a href="../cathen/01299d.htm">Alexandrian</a> church,  overspread the whole of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and Libya, and the further Thebaid. Eventually it extended its ravages to the other provinces and cities of the empire; so that not only the prelates of the churches might be seen encountering each other in the strife of words, but the people themselves were completely divided, some adhering to one faction and others to another. Nay, so notorious did the scandal of these proceedings become, that the sacred matters of inspired teaching were exposed to the most shameful ridicule in the very theaters of the unbelievers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 62. Concerning the Same Arius, and the Melitians.</h2> 

<p>Some thus at Alexandria maintained an obstinate conflict on the highest questions. Others throughout <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> and the Upper Thebaid, were at variance on account of an earlier controversy: so that the churches were everywhere distracted by divisions. The body therefore being thus diseased, the whole of Libya caught the contagion; and the rest of the remoter provinces became affected with the same disorder. For the disputants at Alexandria sent emissaries to the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the several provinces, who accordingly ranged themselves as partisans on either side, and shared in the same spirit of discord.</p>

<h2>Chapter 63. How Constantine sent a Messenger and a Letter concerning Peace.</h2>

<p>As soon as the emperor was informed of these facts, which he heard with much sorrow of heart, considering them in the light of a calamity personally affecting himself, he immediately selected from the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> in his train one whom he well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be approved for the sobriety and genuineness of his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,  and who had before this time distinguished himself by the boldness of his religious profession, and sent him to negotiate peace  between the dissentient parties at Alexandria. He also made him the bearer of a most needful and appropriate letter to the original movers of the strife: and this letter, as exhibiting a specimen of his watchful care over God's people, it may be well to introduce into this our narrative of his life. Its purport was as follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 64. Constantine's Letter to Alexander the Bishop, and Ariusthe Presbyter.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Victor Constantinus, Maximus Augustus</span>, to Alexander and <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>.</p>

<p>I call that God to <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, as well I may, who is the helper of my endeavors, and the Preserver of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, that I had a twofold reason for undertaking that duty which I have now performed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 65. His Continual Anxiety for Peace.</h2>

<p>My design then was, first, to bring the diverse judgments formed by all nations respecting the Deity to a condition, as it were, of settled uniformity; and, secondly, to restore to health the system of the world, then suffering under the malignant power of a grievous distemper. Keeping these objects in view, I sought to accomplish the one by the secret eye of thought, while the other I tried to rectify by the power of military authority. For I was aware that, if I should succeed in establishing, according to my hopes, a common harmony of sentiment among all the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the general course of affairs would also experience a change correspondent to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> desires of them all.</p>

<h2>Chapter 66. That he also adjusted the Controversies which had arisen in Africa.</h2>

<p>Finding, then, that the whole of Africa was pervaded by an intolerable spirit of mad folly, through the influence of those who with heedless frivolity had presumed to rend the religion of the people into diverse <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>; I was anxious to check this disorder, and could discover no other remedy equal to the occasion, except in sending some of yourselves to aid in restoring mutual harmony among the disputants, after I had removed that common enemy  of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a> who had interposed his lawless sentence for the prohibition of your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> synods.</p>

<h2>Chapter 67. That Religion began in the East.</h2>

<p>For since the power of Divine light, and the law of sacred worship, which, proceeding in the first instance, through the favor of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from the bosom, as it were, of the East, have illumined the world, by their sacred radiance, I naturally <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that you would be the first to promote the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of other nations, and resolved with all energy of thought and diligence of enquiry to seek your aid. As soon, therefore, as I had secured my decisive victory and unquestionable triumph over my enemies, my first enquiry was concerning that object which I felt to be of paramount interest and importance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 68. Being grieved by the Dissension, he counsels Peace.</h2>

<p>But, O <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Providence of God! How deep a wound did not my ears only, but my very heart receive in the report that divisions <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among yourselves more grievous still than those which continued in that country!  so that you, through whose aid I had hoped to procure a remedy for the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> of others, are in a state which needs healing even more than theirs. And yet, having made a careful enquiry into the origin and foundation of these differences, I find the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> to be of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> insignificant character, and quite unworthy of such fierce contention. Feeling myself, therefore, compelled to address you in this letter, and to appeal at the same time to your unanimity  and sagacity, I call on <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a> to assist me in the task, while I interrupt your dissension in the character of a minister of peace. And with reason: for if I might expect, with the help of a higher Power, to be able without difficulty, by a judicious appeal to the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> feelings of those who heard me, to recall them to a better spirit, even though the occasion of the disagreement were a greater one, how can I refrain from promising myself a far easier and more speedy adjustment of this difference, when the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which hinders general harmony of sentiment is intrinsically trifling and of little moment?</p>

<h2>Chapter 69. Origin of the Controversy between Alexander and Arius, and that these Questions ought not to have been discussed.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">I understand</span>, then, that the origin of the present controversy is this. When you, Alexander, demanded of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> what opinion they severally maintained respecting a certain passage in the Divine law,  or rather, I should say, that you asked them something connected with an unprofitable question, then you, <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, inconsiderately insisted on  what ought never to have been conceived at all, or if conceived, should have been buried in profound silence. Hence it was that a dissension arose between you, fellowship was withdrawn,  and the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> people, rent into diverse parties, no longer preserved the unity of the one body. Now, therefore, do ye both exhibit an equal degree of forbearance,  and receive the advice which your fellow-servant righteously gives. What then is this advice? It was wrong in the first instance to propose such questions as these, or to reply to them when propounded. For those points of discussion which are enjoined by the authority of no law, but rather suggested by the contentious spirit which is fostered by misused leisure, even though they may be intended merely as an intellectual exercise, ought certainly to be confined to the region of our own thoughts, and not hastily produced in the popular assemblies, nor unadvisedly entrusted to the general ear. For how very few are there able either accurately to comprehend, or adequately to explain subjects so sublime and abstruse in their nature? Or, granting that one were fully competent for this, how many people will he convince? Or, who, again, in dealing with questions of such subtle nicety as these, can secure himself against a dangerous declension from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? It is incumbent therefore on us in these cases to be sparing of our words, lest, in case we ourselves are unable, through the feebleness of our natural faculties, to give a clear explanation of the subject before us, or, on the other hand, in case the slowness of our hearers' understandings disables them from arriving at an accurate apprehension of what we say, from one or other of these causes the people be reduced to the alternative either of <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 70. An Exhortation to Unanimity.</h2>

<p>Let therefore both the unguarded question and the inconsiderate answer receive your mutual forgiveness.  For the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of your difference has not been any of the leading doctrines or precepts of the Divine law, nor has any new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> respecting the worship of God arisen among you. You are in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of one and the same judgment:  you may therefore well join in communion and fellowship.</p>

<h2>Chapter 71. There should be no Contention in Matters which are in themselves of Little Moment.</h2>

<p>For as long as you continue to contend about these small and very insignificant questions, it is not fitting that so large a portion of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s people should be under the direction of your judgment, since you are thus divided between yourselves. I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> it indeed to be not merely unbecoming, but positively <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, that such should be the case. But I will refresh your minds by a little illustration, as follows. You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, though they all adhere to one system, are yet frequently at issue on certain points, and differ, perhaps, in their degree of <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>: yet they are recalled to harmony of sentiment by the uniting power of their common doctrines. If this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, is it not far more reasonable that you, who are the ministers of the Supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, should be of one mind respecting the profession of the same religion? But let us still more thoughtfully and with closer attention examine what I have said, and see whether it be right that, on the ground of some trifling and foolish verbal difference between ourselves, brethren should assume towards each other the attitude of enemies, and the august meeting of the Synod be rent by profane disunion, because of you who wrangle together on points so trivial and altogether unessential? This is vulgar, and rather characteristic of childish <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, than consistent with the wisdom of <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> and men of sense. Let us withdraw ourselves with a good will from these <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. Our great God and common Saviour of all has granted the same light to us all. Permit me, who am his servant, to bring my task to a successful issue, under the direction of his Providence, that I may be enabled, through my exhortations, and diligence, and earnest admonition, to recall his people to communion and fellowship. For since you have, as I said, but one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and one sentiment respecting our religion, and since the Divine commandment in all its parts enjoins on us all the duty of maintaining a spirit of concord, let not the circumstance which has led to a slight difference between you, since it does not affect the validity of the whole, <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> any division or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> among you. And this I say without in any way desiring to force you to entire unity of judgment in regard to this <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> idle question, whatever its real nature may be. For the dignity of your synod may be preserved, and the communion of your whole body maintained unbroken, however wide a difference may exist among you as to unimportant matters. For we are not all of us like-minded on every subject, nor is there such a thing as one disposition and judgment common to all alike. As far, then, as regards the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">Divine Providence</a>, let there be one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and one understanding among you, one united judgment in reference to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But as to your subtle disputations on questions of little or no significance, though you may be unable to harmonize in sentiment, such differences should be consigned to the secret custody of your own minds and thoughts. And now, let the preciousness of common affection, let <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, let the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> due to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and to the observance of his law continue immovably among you. Resume, then, your mutual feelings of friendship, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and regard: restore to the people their wonted embracings; and do ye yourselves, having purified your <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, as it were, once more acknowledge one another. For it often happens that when a reconciliation is effected by the removal of the causes of enmity, friendship becomes even sweeter than it was before.</p>

<h2>Chapter 72. The Excess of his Pious Concern caused him to shed Tears; and his Intended Journey to the East was postponed because of These Things.</h2>

<p><q>Restore me then my quiet days, and untroubled nights, that the <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of undimmed light, the delight of a tranquil life, may henceforth be my portion. Else must I needs mourn, with constant tears, nor shall I be able to pass the residue of my days in peace. For while the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose fellow-servant I am, are thus divided among themselves by an unreasonable and pernicious spirit of contention, how is it possible that I shall be able to maintain tranquillity of mind? And I will give you a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> how great my sorrow has been on this behalf. Not long since I had visited <a href="../cathen/11070a.htm">Nicomedia</a>, and intended immediately to proceed from that city to the East. It was while I was hastening towards you, and had already accomplished the greater part of the distance, that the news of this matter reversed my plan, that I might not be compelled to see with my own eyes that which I felt myself scarcely able even to hear. Open then for me henceforward by your unity of judgment that road to the regions of the East which your dissensions have closed against me, and permit me speedily to see yourselves and all other peoples rejoicing together, and render due acknowledgment to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the language of praise and thanksgiving for the restoration of general concord and liberty to all.</q></p>

<h2>Chapter 73. The Controversy continues without Abatement, even after the Receipt of This Letter.</h2>

<p>In this manner the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> emperor endeavored by means of the foregoing letter to promote the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>. And the excellent man  to whom it was entrusted performed his part not merely by communicating the letter itself, but also by seconding the views of him who sent it; for he was, as I have said, in all respects a person of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> character. The <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, however, was greater than could be remedied by a single letter, insomuch that the acrimony of the contending parties continually increased, and the effects of the mischief extended to all the Eastern provinces. These things jealousy and some <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> spirit who looked with an <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> eye on the prosperity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, wrought.</p>
