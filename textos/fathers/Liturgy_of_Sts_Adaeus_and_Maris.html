<h1>Liturgy of Sts. Adaeus and Maris</h1>

<p></p>
<p> <em>Composed by St. Ad&aelig;us and St. Maris, Teachers of the Easterns. </em></p>

<p>I.  <span style="italic">First</span>: Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, etc. Our Father which art in heaven.</p>

<p> <em>Prayer.</em></p>

<p>Strengthen, O our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our weakness through Your mercy, that we may administer the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> which has been given for the renovation and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of our degraded nature, through the mercies of Your beloved Son the Lord of all.</p>

<p> <em>On common days.</em></p>

<p>Adored, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, lauded, celebrated, exalted, and <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in heaven and on earth, be the adorable and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> name of Your ever-<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Trinity, O Lord of all.</p>

<p><span style="italic">On common days they sing the Psalm</span> (xv.), Lord, who shall dwell in Your tabernacle? <span style="italic">entire with its canon,</span> <span style="font-style: italic;"> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>.</span> </p>

<p> <em>(Aloud.)</em></p>

<p>Who shall shout with <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>? Etc.</p>

<p> <em>Prayer.</em></p>

<p>II. Before the resplendent throne of Your majesty, O Lord, and the exalted and sublime throne of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, and on the awful seat of the strength of Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and the propiatory altar which Your will has established, in the region of Your pasture,  with thousands of <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> praising You, and ten thousands of seraphim sanctifying You, we draw near, adore, thank, and glorify You always, O Lord of all.</p>

<p> <em>On commemorations and Fridays.</em></p>

<p>Your name, great and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, illustrious and blessed, the blessed and incomprehensible name of Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Trinity, and Your kindness to our race, we ought at all times to bless, adore, and glorify, O Lord of all.</p>

<p> <em>Responsory  at the <a href="../cathen/03572b.htm">chancel</a>, as above.</em></p>

<p>Who commanded, etc.</p>

<p>To the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, etc.</p>

<p> <em>Prayer.</em></p>

<p>How breathes in us, O our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the sweet fragrance of the sweetness of Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; illumined are our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, through the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of Your <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: may we be rendered worthy of receiving the manifestation of Your beloved from Your <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> heavens: there shall we render thanks unto You, and, in the meantime, glorify You without ceasing in Your Church, crowned and filled with every aid and blessing, because You are Lord and Father, Creator of all.</p>

<p> <em>III. Prayer of Incense.</em></p>

<p>We shall repeat the hymn to Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Trinity, O Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p> <em>On fast-days.</em></p>

<p>And on account, etc.</p>

<p> <em>At the commemoration of <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>.</em></p>

<p>You, O Lord, art <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the raiser up of our bodies: You are the good Saviour of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and the secure preserver of our life; and we ought to thank You continually, to adore and glorify You, O Lord of all.</p>

<p> <em>At the lessons. </em></p>

<p>Holy are You, worthy of praise, mighty, <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, who dwellest in the holies, and Your will rests in them: have regard unto us, O Lord; be merciful unto us, and pity us, as You are our helper in all circumstances, O Lord of all.</p>

<p> <em>IV. At the apostle. </em></p>

<p>Enlighten, O our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the movements of our meditations to hear and understand the sweet listenings to Your life-giving and divine commands; and grant unto us through Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy to gather from them the assurance of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, and hope, and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> suitable to <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body, and we shall sing to You everlasting <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> without ceasing and always, O Lord of all.</p>

<p> <em>On fast-days.</em></p>

<p>To You, the wise governor, etc.</p>

<p> <em>V. Descending, he shall salute the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, saying this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> before the altar.</em></p>

<p>You, the renowned seed of Your Father, and the image of the person of Your Father, who was revealed in the body of our humanity, and arose to us in the light of Your annunciation, You we thank, adore, etc.</p>

<p> <em>And after the proclamation: &mdash; </em></p>

<p>You, O Lord God Almighty, we beseech and entreat, perfect with us Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and pour out through our hands Your gift, the pity and compassion of Your divinity. May they be to us for the propitiation of the offenses of Your people, and for the forgiveness of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the entire flock of Your pasture, through Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and tender mercies, O good friend of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, O Lord of all.</p>

<p> <em>VI. The Deacons say:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Bow your heads.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest says this secret <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in the sanctuary: &mdash; </em></p>

<p>O Lord God Omnipotent, Yours is the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, inasmuch as You, through the great passion of Your Christ, bought the sheep of Your pasture; and from the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who is indeed of one nature with Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> divinity, are granted the degrees of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> ordination; and through Your clemency You vouchsafed, O Lord, to make our weakness spiritual members in the great body of Your Holy Church, that we might administer spiritual aid to faithful <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. Now, O Lord, perfect Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> with us, and pour out Your gift through our hands: and may Your tender mercies and the clemency of Your divinity be upon us, and upon the people whom You have chosen for Yourself.</p>

<p> <em>(Aloud.)</em></p>

<p>And grant unto us, O Lord, through Your clemency, that we may all together, and equally every day of our life, please Your divinity, and be rendered worthy of the aid of Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to offer You praise, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, thanksgiving, and adoration at all times, O Lord.</p>

<p> <em>VII. And the Deacons ascend to the altar, and say:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>He who has not received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, etc. </p>

<p> <em>And the Priest begins the responsory of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>,  and the Sacristan and Deacon place the disk and the chalice upon the altar. The Priest crosses his hands, and says: &mdash; </em></p>

<p>We offer praise to Your <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Trinity at all times and for ever.</p>

<p> <em>And proceeds:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>May Christ, who was offered for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and commanded us to commemorate His death and His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, Himself receive this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> from the hands of our weakness, through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercies for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>And proceeds:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Laid are the renowned <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and life-giving <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> upon the altar of the mighty Lord, even until His advent, for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p>Praise, etc.</p>

<p>Your memory, etc.</p>

<p>Our Father, etc.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Upon the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> altar, etc.</p>

<p>They who have slept, etc.</p>

<p>Matthew Mark, Luke, etc. </p>

<p> <em>THE CREED. </em></p>

<p> <em>VIII. The Priest draws near to celebrate, and thrice bows before the altar, the middle of which he kisses, then the right and the left horn of the altar; and bows to the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> side, and says:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Bless, O Lord, etc.</p>

<p>Pray for me, my fathers, brethren, and masters, that God may grant unto me the capability and power to perform this service to which I have drawn near, and that this oblation may be accepted from the hands of my weakness, for myself, for you, and for the whole body of the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercies for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>And they respond:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>May Christ listen to your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, and be pleased with your <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, receive your oblation, and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> your <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, and grant unto us, through your mediation,  the pardon of our offenses, and the forgiveness of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercies for ever. </p>

<p> <em>Presently he bows at the other side, uttering the same words; and they respond in the same manner: then he bows to the altar, and says:&mdash; </em></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, Lord of all, be with us through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercies for ever. <a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>And bowing towards the Deacon, who is on the left (Epistle side), he says:&mdash; </em></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord of all, confirm your words, and secure to you peace, and accept this oblation from my hands for me, for you, for the whole body of the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and for the entire world, through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercies for ever.</p>

<p> <em>He kneels at the altar, and says in secret:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>IX. O our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, look not on the multitude of our <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and let not Your dignity be turned away on account of the heinousness of our iniquities; but through Your unspeakable <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> sanctify this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of Yours, and grant through it power and capability, so that You may forget our many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and be merciful when You shall appear at the end of time, in the man whom You have assumed from among us, and we may find before You <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> and mercy, and be rendered worthy to praise You with spiritual  assemblies.</p>

<p> <em>He rises, and says this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in secret:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>We thank You, O our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the abundant riches of Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> to us:</p>

<p> <em>And he proceeds:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Us who were sinful and degraded, on account of the multitude of Your clemency, You have made worthy to celebrate the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of the body and blood of Your Christ. We beg aid from You for the strengthening of our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, that in perfect <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> we may administer Your gift to us.</p>

<p> <em>Canon.</em></p>

<p> And we shall ascribe to You praise, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, thanksgiving, and adoration, now, always, and for ever and ever.</p>

<p> <em>He signs himself with the sign of the <a href="../cathen/04529a.htm">cross</a>, and they respond:&mdash; </em></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>X. And he proceeds:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Peace be with you:</p>

<p> <em>They respond:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>With you and with your spirit.</p>

<p> <em>And they give the (<a href="../cathen/08663a.htm">kiss</a> of) peace to each other, and say:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>For all: </p>

<p> <em>The Deacon says:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Let us thank, entreat, and beseech.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest says this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in secret:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>O Lord, mighty <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, help my weakness through Your clemency and the aid of Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and make me worthy of offering before You this oblation, as for the common aid of all, and to the praise of Your Trinity, O Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.</p>

<p> <em>Another <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>. </em></p>

<p>O our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, restrain our thoughts, that they wander not amid the vanities of this world. O Lord our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, grant that I may be united to the affection of Your <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, unworthy though I be. Glory be to You, O Christ.</p>

<p>Ascend into the chamber of Your renowned light, O Lord; sow in me the good seed of humility; and under the wings of Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> hide me through Your mercy. If You were to mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? Because there is mercy with You.</p>

<p> <em>[The Priest says the following <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> in secret: &mdash; </em></p>

<p>O mother of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, beseech for me the only-begotten Son, who was born of you, to forgive me my offenses and my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and to accept from my feeble and sinful hands this <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> which my weakness offers upon this altar, through your intercession for me, O <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mother.]</p>

<p> <em>XI. When the Deacon shall say, <span style="font-style: normal;">With watchfulness and care, etc., </span> immediately the Priest rises up and uncovers the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, taking away the veil with which they were covered: he blesses the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and says a canon with a loud voice:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the communion of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, be with us all, now, etc. </p>

<p> <em>He signs the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and they respond:&mdash; </em></p>

<p><a href="../cathen/01407b.htm">Amen</a>.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest proceeds:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Lift up your minds:</p>

<p> <em>They respond:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>They are towards You, O God of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, Isaac, and <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, O <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> King. </p>

<p> <em>The Priest.</em></p>

<p>The oblation is offered to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Lord of all.</p>

<p> <em>They respond:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>It is meet and right.</p>

<p> <em>The Deacon.</em></p>

<p>Peace be with you.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest puts on the <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and says this <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>O Lord, Lord, grant me an open countenance before You, that with the confidence which is from You we may fulfil this awful and divine <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> with <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">consciences</a> free from all iniquity and bitterness. Sow in us, O Lord, affection, peace, and concord towards each other, and toward every one.</p>

<p> <em>And standing, he says in secret: &mdash; </em></p>

<p>Worthy of <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> from every mouth, and of thanksgiving from all tongues, and of adoration and exaltation from all creatures, is the adorable and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> name of Father, Son, and <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, who created the world through His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, and its inhabitants through His clemency, who saved men through His mercy, and showed great favour towards mortals. Your majesty, O Lord, thousands of thousands of heavenly <span style="italic">spirits</span>, and ten thousand myriads of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, hosts of spirits, ministers of fire and spirit, bless and adore; with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03646c.htm">cherubim</a> and the spiritual seraphim they sanctify and celebrate Your name, crying and praising, without ceasing crying unto each other.</p>

<p> <em>They say with a loud voice:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, Lord God Almighty; full are the heavens and the earth of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>.</p>

<p> <em>The Priest in secret:&mdash; </em></p>

<p>Holy, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> are You, O Lord God Almighty; the heavens and the earth are full of His <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> and the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of His <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, as they are <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of His splendour; <span style="italic">as it is written</span>, The heaven and the earth are full of me, says the mighty Lord.</p>

<p>Holy are You, O God <span style="italic">our</span> Father, <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> the only one, of whom the whole <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a> in heaven and earth is named. Holy are You, Eternal Son, through whom all things were made. Holy are You, Holy, Eternal Spirit, through whom all things are sanctified.</p>

<p>Woe to me, woe to me, who have been astonied, because I am a man of polluted lips, and dwell among a people of polluted lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the mighty Lord. How terrible today is this place! For this is none other than the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the gate of heaven; because You have been seen eye to eye, O Lord.</p>

<p>Now, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, may Your <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be with us, O Lord; purge away our impurities, and sanctify our lips; unite the voices of our insignificance with the sanctification of seraphim and archangels.

<p>May <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, to whom we have ministered, and whom we have seen and honoured in His renowned, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, life-giving, and divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, Himself render us worthy of the splendid <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of His kingdom, and of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a> with His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and for confidence before Him, that we may stand at His right hand.</p>

<p>And on our entire congregation may His mercies and compassion be continually poured out, now and always, and ever.</p>

<p> <em>On the Lord's day and on feast-days.</em></p>

<p>May He Himself who blessed us with all spiritual blessings in the heavens, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord, and prepared us for His kingdom, and called us to the desirable <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things which neither cease nor perish, as He promised to us in His life-giving <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, and said to the blessed congregation of His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>&mdash; Verily, verily I say unto you, that every one who eats my body and drinks my blood, abides in me, and I in him, and I will raise him up at the last day; and he comes not to judgment, but I will make him pass from death to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life:</p>

<p>May He Himself now bless this congregation, and maintain our position, and render <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> our people who have come and rejoiced in receiving His renowned, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, life-giving, and divine <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>; and may you be sealed and guarded by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sign of the Lord's cross from all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, secret and open, now and always.</p>
