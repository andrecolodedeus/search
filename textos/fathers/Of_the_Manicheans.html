<h1>Of the Manicheans</h1>


<h2>Chapter 1. The Excellence of the Christian Philosophy; The Origin of Heresies Amongst Christians</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> is termed simple. But it bestows very great attention to the formation of manners, enigmatically insinuating words of more certain <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> respecting <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the principal of which, so far as any earnest serious purpose in those matters is concerned, all will have received when they assume an efficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, very noble and very ancient, as the originator of all things that have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>. For <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> leaving to ethical students matters more toilsome and difficult, as, for instance, what is <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, moral and intellectual; and to those who employ their time in forming hypotheses respecting morals, and the <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> and affections, without marking out any element by which each <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is to be attained, and heaping up, as it were, at random precepts less subtle&mdash; the common people, hearing these, even as we learn by experience, make great progress in modesty, and a character of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> is imprinted on their manners, quickening the moral disposition which from such usages is formed, and leading them by degrees to the desire of what is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> and good. </p>

<p>But this being divided into many questions by the number of those who come after, there arise many, just as is the case with those who are devoted to dialectics,  some more skilful than others, and, so to speak, more sagacious in handling nice and subtle questions; so that now they come forward as <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> and originators of <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>. And by these the formation of morals is hindered and rendered obscure; for those do not attain unto certain verity of discourse who wish to become the heads of the <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sects</a>, and the common people is to a greater degree excited to strife and contention. And there being no rule nor law by which a solution may be obtained of the things which are called in question, but, as in other matters, this ambitious rivalry running out into excess, there is nothing to which it does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> damage and injury.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. The Age of Manicaeus, or Manes; His First Disciples; The Two Principles; Manichaean Matter</h2>

<p>So in these matters also, while in novelty of opinion each endeavours to show himself first and superior, they brought this <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a>, which is simple, almost to a nullity. Such was he whom they call Manichaeus,  a Persian by race, my instructor in whose doctrine was one Papus by name, and after him Thomas, and some others followed them. They say that the man lived when Valerian was emperor, and that he served under Sapor, the king of the Persians, and having offended him in some way, was <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a>. Some such report of his character and <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> has come to hie from those who were intimately acquainted with him. He laid down two principles, God and Matter. God he called good, and matter he affirmed to be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But God excelled more in good than matter in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. But he calls matter not that which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> calls it,  which becomes everything when it has received quality and figure, whence he terms it all-embracing&mdash; the mother and nurse of all things; nor what Aristotle  calls an element, with which form and privation have to do, but something beside these. For the motion which in individual things is incomposite, this he calls matter, On the side of God are ranged powers, like handmaids, all good; and likewise, on the side of matter are ranged other powers, all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Moreover, the bright shining, the light, and the superior, all these are with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; while the obscure, and the darkness, and the inferior are with matter. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, too, has desires, but they are all good; and matter, likewise, which are all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. The Fancies of Manichaeus Concerning Matter</h2>

<p>It came to pass on a time that matter conceived a desire to attain to the superior region; and when it had arrived there, it admired the brightness and the light which was with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And, indeed, it wished to seize on for itself the place of pre-eminence, and to remove God from His position. <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, moreover, deliberated how to avenge Himself upon matter, but was destitute of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> necessary to do so, for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> does not exist in the house and abode of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. He sent, therefore, the power which we call the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> into matter, to permeate it entirely. For it will be the death of matter, when at length hereafter this power is separated from it. So, therefore, by the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> was commingled with matter, an unlike thing with an unlike. Now by this commingling the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> has contracted <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and labours under the same infirmity as matter. For, just as in a corrupted vessel, the contents are oftentimes vitiated in quality, so, also the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that is in matter suffers some such change, and is deteriorated from its own nature so as to participate in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of matter. But God had compassion upon the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, and sent forth another power, which we call <em><a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a></em>  that is, the Creator of all things; and when this power had arrived, and taken in hand the creation of the world, it separated from matter as much power as from the commingling had contracted no <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and stain, and hence the sun and moon were first formed; but that which had contracted some slight and moderate stain, this became the J stars and the expanse of heaven. Of the matter from which the sun and the moon was separated, part was cast entirely out of the world, and is that fire in which, indeed, there is the power of burning, although in itself it is dark and void of light, being closely similar to night. But in the rest of the elements, both animal and vegetable, in those the divine power is unequally mingled. And therefore the world was made, and in it the sun and moon who preside over the birth and death of things, by separating the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from matter, and transmitting it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4. The Moon's Increase and Wane; The Manichaean Trifling Respecting It; Their Dreams About Man and Christ; Their Foolish System of Abstinence</h2>

<p>He ordained this, forsooth, to supply to the <em><a href="../cathen/04707b.htm">Demiurge</a></em>,  or Creator, another power which might attract to the splendour of the sun; and the thing is manifest, as one might say, even to a blind person. For the moon in its increase receives the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is separated from matter, and during the time of its augmentation comes forth full of it. But when it is full, in its wanings, it remits it to the sun, and the sun goes back to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And when it has done this, it waits again to receive from another full moon a migration of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> to itself, and receiving this in the same way, it suffers it to pass on to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this is its work continually, and in every age. And in the sun some such image is seen, as is the form of man. And matter ambitiously strove to make man from itself by mingling together all its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so that it might have some portion of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But his form contributed much to man's obtaining a greater share, and one beyond all other animals, in the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. For he is the image of the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, but Christ is the intelligence. Who, when He had at length come from the superior region, dismissed a very great part of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And at length being crucified, in this way He furnished <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and fitted the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be crucified in matter. Because, therefore, it is the Divine will and decree that matter should perish, they abstain from those things which have life, and feed upon vegetables, and everything which is void of sense. They abstain also from marriage and the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of Venus, and the procreation of children, that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may not strike its root deeper in matter by the succession of race; nor do they go abroad, seeking to purify themselves from the stain which <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has contracted from its admixture with matter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5. The Worship of the Sun and Moon Under God; Support Sought for the Manichaeans in the Grecian Fables; The Authority of the Scriptures and Faith Despised by the Manichaeans</h2>

<p>These things are the principal of what they say and think. And they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> very especially the sun and moon, not as gods, but as the way by which it is possible to attain unto <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But when the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has been entirely separated off, they say that the exterior fire will fall, and burn up both itself and all else that is left of matter. Those of them who are better <a href="../cathen/05295b.htm">educated</a>, and not unacquainted with Greek literature, instruct us from their own resources. From the ceremonies and <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, for instance: by Bacchus, who was cut out from the womb, is signified that the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is divided into matter by the Titans, as they say; from the poet's fable of the battle with the Giants, is indicated that not even they were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the rebellion of matter against God. I indeed will not deny, that these things are not sufficient to lead away the minds of those who receive words without examining them, since the deception caused by discourse of this sort has drawn over to itself some of those who have pursued the study of <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophy</a> with me; but in what manner I should approach the thing to examine into it, I am at a loss indeed. For their hypotheses do not proceed by any legitimate method, so that one might institute an examination in accordance with these; neither are there any principles of demonstrations, so that we may see what follows on these; but theirs is the rare discovery of those who are simply said to philosophize. These men, taking to themselves the Old and New Scriptures, though they lay it down that these are divinely inspired, draw their own opinions from thence; and then only think they are refuted, when it happens that anything not in accordance with these is said or done by them. And what to those who philosophize after the manner of the Greeks, as respects principles of demonstration, are intermediate propositions; this, with them, is the voice of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>. But here, all these things being eliminated, and since those matters, which I before mentioned, are put forward without any demonstration, and since it is necessary to give an answer in a rational way, and not to put forward other things more plausible, and which might prove more enticing, my attempt is rather troublesome, and on this account the more arduous, because it is necessary to bring forward arguments of a varied nature. For the more accurate arguments will escape the observation of those who have been convinced beforehand by these men without <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, if, when it comes to persuasion, they fall into the same hands. For they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they proceed from like sources. There is, therefore, need of much and great diligence, and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to be the guide of our argument.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6. The Two Principles of the Manichaeans; Themselves Controverted; The Pythagorean Opinion Respecting First Principles; Good and Evil Contrary; The Victory on the Side of Good</h2>

<p>They lay down two principles, God and Matter. If he (Manes) separates that which comes into being from that which really exists, the supposition is not so faulty in this, that neither does matter create itself, nor does it admit two contrary qualities, in being both active and passive; nor, again, are other such theories proposed concerning the creative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> as it is not lawful to speak of. And yet God does not stand in need of matter in order to make things, since in His mind all things substantially exist, so far as the possibility of their coming into being is concerned. But if, as he seems rather to mean, the unordered motion of things really existent under Him is matter, first, then, he unconsciously sets up another creative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (and yet an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one), nor does he perceive what follows from this, namely, that if it is necessary that God and matter should be supposed, some other matter must be supposed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so that to each of the creative causes there should be the subject matter. Therefore, instead of two, he will be shown to give us four first principles. Wonderful, too, is the distinction. For if he thinks this to be <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and wishes to conceive of something opposite to Him, why does he not, as some of the Pythagoreans, set <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> over against Him? It is more tolerable, indeed, that two principles should be spoken of by them, the good and the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and that these are continually striving, but the good prevails. For if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> were to prevail, all things would perish. Wherefore matter, by itself, is neither body, nor is it exactly incorporeal, nor simply any particular thing; but it is something indefinite, which, by the addition of form, comes to be defined; as, for instance, fire is a pyramid, air an octahedron, water an eikosahedron, and earth a cube; how, then, is matter the unordered motion of the elements? By itself, indeed, it does not subsist, for if it is motion, it is in that which is moved; but matter does not seem to be of such a nature, but rather the first subject, and unorganized, from which other things proceed. Since, therefore, matter is unordered motion, was it always conjoined with that which is moved, or was it ever separate from it? For, if it were ever by itself, it would not be in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>; for there is no motion without something moved. But if it was always in that which is moved, then, again, there will be two principles&mdash; that which moves, and that which is moved. To which of these two, then, will it be granted that it subsists as a primary <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> along with God?</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Motion Vindicated from the Charge of Irregularity; Circular; Straight; Of Generation and Corruption; Of Alteration, and Quality Affecting Sense</h2>

<p>There is added to the discourse an appendix quite foreign to it.  For you may reasonably speak of motion not existing. And what, also, is the matter of motion? Is it straight or circular? Or does it take place by a process of change, or by a process of generation and corruption? The circular motion, indeed, is so orderly and composite, that it is ascribed to the order of all <a href="../cathen/04470a.htm">created</a> things; nor does this, in the Manichaean system, appear worthy to be impugned, in which move the sun and the moon, whom alone, of the gods, they say that they venerate. But as regards that which is straight: to this, also, there is a bound when it reaches its own place. For that which is earthly ceases entirely from motion, as soon as it has touched the earth. And every animal and vegetable makes an end of increasing when it has reached its limit. Therefore the stoppage of these things would be more properly the death of matter, than that endless death, which is, as it were, woven for it by them. But the motion which arises by a process of generation and corruption it is impossible to think of as in harmony with this hypothesis, for, according to them, matter is unbegotten. But if they ascribe to it the motion of alteration, as they term it, and that by which we suffer change by a quality affecting the sense, it is worth while to consider how they come to say this. For this seems to be the principal thing that they assert, since by matter it comes to pass, as they say, that manners are changed, and that <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> arises in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For in altering, it will always begin from the beginning; and, proceeding onwards, it will reach the middle, and thus will it attain unto the end. But when it has reached the end, it will not stand still, at least if alteration is its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>. But it will again, by the same route, return to the beginning, and from thence in like manner to the end; nor will it ever cease from doing this. As, for instance, if <span class="greek">&#x03B1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x03B3;</span> suffer alteration, and the middle is <span class="greek">&#x03B2;</span>, a by being changed, will arrive at <span class="greek">&#x03B2;</span>, and from thence will go on to <span class="greek">&#x03B3;</span> . Again returning from the extreme <span class="greek">&#x03B3;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x03B2;</span>, it will at some time or other arrive at <span class="greek">&#x03B1;</span>; and this goes on continuously. As in the change from black, the middle is dun, and the extreme, white. Again, in the contrary direction, from white to dun, and in like manner to black; and again from white the change begins, and goes the same round.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Is Matter Wicked? Of God and Matter</h2>

<p>Is matter, in respect of alteration, an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? It is thus <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that it is not more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> than good. For let the beginning of the, change be from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Thus the change is from this to good through that which is indifferent. But let the alteration be from good. Again the beginning goes on through that which is indifferent. Whether the motion be to one extreme or to the other, the method is the same, and this is abundantly set Forth. All motion has to do with quantity; but quality is the guide in <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>. Now we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that these two are generically distinguished. But are God and matter alone principles, or floes there remain anything else which is the mean between these two? For it there is nothing, these things remain unintermingled one with another. And it is well said that if the extremes are intermingled, there is a necessity for some thing intermediate to connect them. But if something else exists, it is necessary that that something be either body or incorporeal, and thus a third adventitious principle makes its appearance. First, therefore, if we suppose God and matter to be both entirely incorporeal, so that neither is in the other, except as the science of grammar is in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>; to understand this of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and matter is absurd. But if, as in a vacuum, as some say, the vacuum is [surrounded by this <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>; the other, again, is without substance, for the substance of a vacuum is nothing. But if as accidents, first, indeed, this is impossible; for the thing that wants sub stance cannot be in any place; for substance is, as it were, the vehicle underlying the accident. But if both are bodies, it is necessary for both to be either heavy or light, or middle; or one heavy, and another light, or intermediate. If, then, both are heavy, it is plainly necessary that these should be the same, both among light things and those things which are of the middle sort; or if they alternate, the one will be altogether separate from the other. For that which is heavy has one place, and that which is middle another, and the light another. To one belongs the superior, to the other the inferior, and to the third the middle. Now in every spherical figure the inferior part is the middle; for from this to all the higher parts, even to the topmost superficies, the distance is every way equal, and, again, all heavy bodies are borne from all sides to it. Wherefore, also, it occurs to me to laugh when I hear that matter moving without order&mdash;for this belongs to it by nature,&mdash; came to the region of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or to light and brightness, and such&mdash; like. But if one be body, and the other incorporeal, first, indeed, that which is body is alone capable of motion And then if they are not intermingled, each is separate from the other according to its proper nature. But if one be mixed up with the other, they will be either mind or <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> or accident. For so only it happens that things incorporeal are mixed up with bodies.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. The Ridiculous Fancies of the Manichaeans About the Motion of Matter Towards God; God the Author of the Rebellion of Matter in the Manichaean Sense; The Longing of Matter for Light and Brightness Good; Divine Good None the Less for Being Communicated</h2>

<p>But in what manner, and from what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, was matter brought to the region of God? For to it by nature belong the lower place and darkness, as they say; and the upper region and light are contrary to its nature. Wherefore there is then attributed to it a supernatural motion; and something of the same sort happens to it, as if a man were to throw a stone or a lump of earth upwards; in this way, the thing being raised a little by the force of the person throwing, when it has reached the upper regions, falls back again into the same place. Who, then, has raised matter to the upper region? Of itself, indeed, and from itself, it would not be moved by that motion which belongs to it. It is necessary, then, that some force should be applied to it for it to be borne aloft, as with the stone and the lump of earth. But they leave nothing else to it but God. It is manifest, therefore, what follows from their argument. That <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, according to them, by force and necessity, raised matter aloft to Himself. But if matter be <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, its desires are altogether <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. Now the desire of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but the desire of good is altogether good. Since, then, matter has desired brightness and light, its desire is not a bad one; just as it is not bad for a man living in <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, afterwards to come to desire <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. On the contrary, he is not guiltless who, being good, coupes to desire what is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. As if any one should say that God desires the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which are attaching to matter. For the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> things of God are not to be so esteemed as great <a href="../cathen/15571a.htm">wealth</a> and large estates, and a large quantity of gold, a lesser portion of which remain with the owner, if one effect a transfer of them to another. But if an image of these things must be formed in the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, I think one would adduce as examples wisdom and the sciences. As, therefore, neither wisdom suffers diminution nor science, and he who is endowed with these experiences no loss if another lie made partaker of them; so, in the same way, it is contrary to reason to think that God grudges matter the desire of what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>; if, indeed, with them we allow that it desires it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. The Mythology Respecting the Gods; The Dogmas of the Manchaeans Resemble This: the Homeric Allegory of the Battle of the Gods; Envy and Emulation Existing; In God According to the Manichaean Opinion; These Vices are to Be Found in No Good Man, and are to Be Accounted Disgraceful</h2>

<p>Moreover, they far surpass the mythologists in fables, those, namely, who either make Coelus suffer mutilation, or idly tell of the plots laid for Saturn by his son, in order that that son might attain the sovereignty; or those again who make Saturn devour his sons and to have been cheated of his purpose by the image of a stone that was presented to him. For how are these things which they put forward dissimilar to those? When they speak openly of the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> between God and matter, and say not these things either in a mythological sense, as Homer in the <em>Iliad</em>;  when he makes Jupiter to <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the strife and <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a> of the gods with each other, thus obscurely signifying that the world is formed of unequal elements, fitted one into another, and either conquering or submitting to a conqueror. And this has been advanced by me, because I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that people of this sort, when they are at a loss for demonstration, bring together from all sides passages from poems, and seek from them a support for their own opinions. Which would not be the case with them if they had only read what they fell in with some reflection. But, when all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is banished from the company of the gods, surely emulation and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> ought especially to have been got rid of. Yet these men leave these things with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when they say that God formed designs against matter, because it felt a desire for good. But with which of those things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> possessed could He have swished to take vengeance on matter? In <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, I think it to be more accurate doctrine to say that God is of a simple nature, than what they advance. Nor, indeed, as in the other things, is the enunciation of this fancy easy. For neither is it possible to demonstrate it simply and with words merely, but with much instruction and labour. But we all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, that <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a> and rage, and the desire of revenge upon matter, are <a href="../cathen/11534a.htm">passions</a> in him who is so agitated. And of such a sort, indeed, as it could never happen to a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man to be harassed by them, much less then can it be that they are connected with the Absolute Good.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. The Transmitted Virtue of the Manichaens; The Virtues of Matter Mixed with Equal or Less Amount of Evil</h2>

<p>To other things, therefore, our discourse has come round about again. For, because they say that God sent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> into matter, it is worth our while to consider whether this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, so far as it pertains to good, in respect of God is less, or whether it is on equal terms with Him. For if it is less, what is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>? For the things which are with God admit of no fellowship with matter. But good alone is the characteristic of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> alone of matter. But if it is on equal terms with Him, what is the reason that He, as a king, issues His commands, and it involuntarily undertakes this labour? Moreover, with regard to matter, it shall be inquired whether, with respect to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> are alike or less. For if they are less, they are altogether of less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. By, fellowship therefore with the good it is that they become so. For there being two <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>, the less has plainly by its fellowship with the good attained to be what it is. But they leave nothing good around matter. Again, therefore. another question arises. For if some other <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, in respect of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, excels the matter which is prevailing, it becomes itself the presiding principle. For that which is more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> will hold the sway in its own dominion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. The Destruction of Evil by the Immission of Virtue Rejected; Because from It Arises No Diminution of Evil; Zeno's Opinion Discarded, that the World Will Be Burnt Up by Fire from the Sun</h2>

<p>But that God sent <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> into matter is asserted without any <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, and it altogether wants probability. Yet it is right that this should have its own explanation. The reason of this they assert, indeed, to be that there might be no more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but that all things should become good. It was necessary for <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be intermingled with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, after the manner of the athletes, who, clasped in a firm embrace, overcome their adversaries, in order that, by conquering <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it might make it to cease to exist. But I think it far more dignified and worthy of the excellence of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at the first conception of things existent, to have abolished matter. But I think they could not allow this, because that something <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is found existing, which they call matter. But it is not any the more possible that things should cease to be such as they are, in order that one should admit that some things are changed into that which is worse. And it is necessary that there should be some perception of this, because these present things have in some manner or other suffered diminution, in order that we might have better hopes for the future. For well has it been answered to the opinion of Zeno of Citium, who thus argued that the world would be destroyed by fire: <q>Everything which has anything to burn will not cease from burning until it has consumed the whole; and the sun is a fire, and will it not burn what it has? </q>Whence he made out, as he imagined, that the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> would be destroyed by fire. But to him a facetious fellow is reported to have said, But I indeed yesterday, and the year before, and a long time ago, have seen, and now in like manner do I see, that no injury has been experienced by the sun; and it is reasonable that this should happen in time and by degrees, so that we may <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that at some time or other the whole will be burnt up. And to the doctrine of Manichaeus, although it rests upon no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, I think that the same answer is apposite, namely, that there has been no diminution in the present condition of things, but what was before in the time of the first man, when brother killed brother, even now continues to be; the same <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a>, and more diverse desires. Now it would be reasonable that these things, if they did not altogether cease, should at least be diminished, if we are to <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> that they are at some time to cease. But while the same things come from them, what is our expectation of them for the future?</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Evil by No Means Found in the Stars and Constellations; All the Evils of Life Vain in the Manichaean Opinion, Which Bring on the Extinction of Life; Their Fancy Having Been Above Explained Concerning the Transportation of Souls from the Moon to the Sun</h2>

<p>But what things does he call <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? As for the sun and moon, indeed, there is nothing lacking; but with respect to the heavens and the stars, whether he says that there is some such thing, and what it is, it is right that we should next in order examine. But irregularity is according to them <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and unordered motion, but these things are always the same, and in the same manner; nor will any one have to blame any of the planets for venturing to delay at any time in the zodiac beyond the fixed period; nor again any of the fixed stars, as if it did not abide in the same seat and position, and did not by circumvolution revolve equally around the world, moving as it were one step backward in a hundred years. But on the earth, if he accuses the roughness of some spots, or if pilots are offended at the storms on the sea; first, indeed, as they think, these things have a share of good in them. For should nothing germinate upon earth, all the animals must presently perish. But this result will send on much of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is intermingled with matter to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there will be a necessity for many moons, to accommodate the great multitude that suddenly approaches. And the same language they hold with respect to the sea. For it is a piece of unlooked-for luck to perish, in order that those things which perish may pursue the road which leads most quickly to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> which are upon the earth, and the famines, and everything which tends to the destruction of life, are held in very great <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by them. For everything which is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of good is to be had in <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>. But these things are the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of good, because of the destruction which accompanies them, if they transmit to God the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is separated from those who perish.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Noxious Animals Worshipped by the Egyptians; Man by Arts an Evil-Doer; Lust and Injustice Corrected by Laws and Discipline; Contingent and Necessary Things in Which There is No Stain</h2>

<p>And, as it seems, we have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the Egyptians rightly worship the crocodile and the lion and the wolf, because these animals being stronger than the others devour their prey, and entirely destroy it; the eagle also and the hawk, because they slaughter the weaker animals both in the air and upon the earth. But perhaps also, according to them, man is for this reason held in special <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, because most of all, by his subtle inventions and arts, he is wont to subdue most of the animals. And lest he himself should have no portion in this good, he becomes the food of others. Again, therefore, those generations are, in their opinion, absurd, which from a small and common seed produce what is great; and it is much more becoming, as they think, that these should be destroyed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order that the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> may be quickly liberated from the troubles incident to living in this world. But what shall we say with respect to <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">injustice</a>, and things of this sort, Manichaeus will ask. Surely against these things discipline and law come to the rescue. Discipline, indeed, using careful forethought that nothing of this sort may have place among men; but law inflicting punishment upon any one who has been caught in the commission of anything <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. But, then, why should it be imputed to the earth as a fault, if the husbandman has neglected to subdue it? Because the sovereignty of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is according to right, suffers diminution, when some parts of it are productive of fruits, and others not so; or when it has happened that when the winds are sweeping, according to another <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, some derive benefit therefrom, while others against their will have to sustain injuries? Surely they must necessarily be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of the character of the things that are contingent, and of those that are necessary. For they would not else thus account such things as prodigies.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15. The Lust and Desire of Sentient Things; Demons; Animals Sentient; So Also the Sun and the Moon and Stars; The Platonic Doctrine, Not the Christian</h2>

<p>Whence, then, come pleasure and desire? For these are the principal <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> that they talk of and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>. Nor <em>does matter appear</em> to be anything else. That these things, indeed, only belong to animals which are endowed with sense, and that nothing else but that which has sense perceives desire and pleasure, is manifest. For what perception of pleasure and pain is there in a plant? What in the earth, water, or air? And the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, if indeed they are living beings endowed with sense, for this reason, perhaps, are delighted with what has been instituted in; regard to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>, and take it ill when these are wanting to them; but nothing of this sort can be imagined with respect to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Therefore those who say, <q>Why are animals affected by pleasure and pain? </q>should first make the complaint, <q>Why are these animals endowed with sense, or why do they stand in need of food? </q>For if animals were <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortal</a>, they would have been set free from corruption and increase; such as the sun and moon and stars, although they are endowed with sense. They are, however, beyond the power of these, and of such a complaint. But man, being able to perceive and to judge, and being potentially wise&mdash;for he has the power to become so&mdash;when he has received what is peculiar to himself, treads it under foot.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Because Some are Wise, Nothing Prevents Others from Being So; Virtue is to Be Acquired by Diligence and Study; By a Sounder Philosophy Men are to Be Carried Onwards to the Good; The Common Study of Virtue Has by Christ Been Opened Up to All</h2>

<p>In general, it is worth while to inquire of these men, Is it possible for no man to become good, or is it in the power of any one? For if no man is wise, what of Manichaeus himself? I pass over the fact that he not only calls others good, but he also says that they are able to make others such. But if one individual is entirely good, what prevents all from becoming good? For what is possible for one is possible also for all. I And by the means by which one has become <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, by the same all may become so, unless they assert that the larger share of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is intercepted by such. Again, therefore, first, What necessity is there for labour in submitting to discipline (for even while sleeping we may become <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>), or what <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is there for these men rousing their hearers to hopes of good? For even though wallowing in the mire with harlots, they can obtain their proper good. But if discipline, and better instruction and diligence in acquiring <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, make a man to become <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtuous</a>, let all become so, and that oft-repeated phrase of theirs, the unordered motion of matter, is made void. But it would be much better for them to say that wisdom is an instrument given by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, in order that by bringing round by degrees to good that which arises to them, from the fact of their being endowed with sense, out of desire or pleasure, it might remove from them the absurdities that flow from them. For thus they themselves who profess to be teachers of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> would be objects of emulation for their purpose. and for their mode of life, and there would be great hopes that one day <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> will cease, when all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> have become wise. And this it seems to me that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus</a> took into consideration; add in order that husbandmen, carpenters, builders, and other artisans, might Bet be driven away from good, He convened a common council of them altogether, and by simple and easy conversations He both raised them to a sense of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and brought them to desire what was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17. The Manichaean Idea of Virtue in Matter Scouted; If One Virtue Has Been Created Immaterial, the Rest are Also Immaterial; Material Virtue an Exploded Notion</h2>

<p>Moreover, how do they say, did God send divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> into matter? For if it always was, and neither is God to be understood as existing prior to it, nor matter either, then again, according to Manichaeus, there are three first principles. Perhaps also, a little further on, there will appear to be many more. But if it be adventitious, and something which has come into <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> afterwards, how is it void of matter? And if they make it to be a part of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, first, indeed, by this conception, they, assert that God is composite and corporeal. But this is absurd, and impossible. And if He fashioned it, and is without matter, I wonder that they have not considered, neither the man himself, nor his <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, that if (as the <a href="../cathen/11330a.htm">orthodox</a> say, the things that come next in order subsist while God remains) God created this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> of His own <a href="../cathen/06259a.htm">free-will</a>, how is it that He is not the author of all oilier things that are made without the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of any pre-existent matter? The consequences, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, of this opinion are evidently absurd; but what does follow is put down next in order. Was it, then, the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to diffuse itself into matter? If it was contrary to its nature, in what manner is it intermingled with it? But if this was in accordance with its nature, it was altogether surely and always with matter. But if this be so, how is it that they call matter <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, which, from the beginning, was intermingled with the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>? In what manner, too, will it be destroyed, the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which was mingled with it at some you or other seceding to itself? For that it preserves safely what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and likely to be productive of some other good to those to whom it is present, is more reasonable than that it should bring destruction or some other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> upon them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Dissolution and Inherence According to the Manichaeans; This is Well Put, <em>ad Hominem</em>, with Respect to Manes, Who is Himself in Matter</h2>

<p>This then is the wise assertion which is made by them&mdash; namely, that as we see that the body perishes when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is separated from it, so also, when <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has left matter, that which is left, which is matter, will be dissolved and perish. First, indeed, they do not perceive that nothing existent can be destroyed into a nonexistent. For that which is non-existent does not exist. But when bodies are disintegrated, and experience a change, a dissolution of them takes place; so that a part of them goes to earth, a part to air, and a part to something else. Besides, they do not remember that their doctrine is, that matter is unordered motion. But that which moves of itself, and of which motion is the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a>, and not a thing accidentally belonging to it&mdash; how is it reasonable to say that when <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> departs, that which was, even before <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> descended into it, should cease to be? Nor do they see the difference, that every body which is devoid of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> is immoveable. For plants also have a vegetable <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. But motion tin the assert to itself, and yet unordered motion they be the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of matter. But it were better, that just as in a lyre which sounds out of tune, by the addition of harmony, everything is brought into concord; so the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> when intermixed with that unordered motion, which, according to them, is matter, should add a certain order to it in the place of its innate disorder, land should always add it suitably to the divine you. For I ask, how was it that Manichaeus himself became fitted to treat of these matters, and when at length did he enunciate them? For they allow that he himself was an admixture of matter, and of the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> received into it. Whether therefore being so, he said these things in unordered motion, surely the opinion is faulty; or whether he said them by means of the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the dogma is dubious and uncertain; for on the one side, that of the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he participates in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; while on the side of unordered motion, he is a partaker in the other part, and changes to <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19. The Second Virtue of the Manichaeans Beset with the Former, and with New Absurdities; Virtue, Active and Passive, the Fashioner of Matter, and Concrete with It; Bodies Divided by Manichaeus into Three Parts</h2>

<p>But if it had been said that divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> both has adorned and does adorn matter, it would have been far more wisely said, and in a manner more conducing to conciliate <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in the doctrine and discourses of Manichaeus. But God has sent down another <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. What has been already said with respect to the former <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, may be equally said with respect to this, and all the absurdities which follow on the teaching about their first <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, the same may be brought forward in the present case. But another, who will tolerate? For why did not God send some one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which could effect everything? If the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind is so various towards all things, so that the same man is endowed with a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of geometry, of astronomy, of the carpenter's art, and the like, is it then impossible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to find one such <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which should be sufficient for him in all respects, so as not to stand in need of a first and second? And why has one <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> the force rather of a creator, and another that of the patient and recipient, so as to be well fitted for admixture with matter. For I do not again see here the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of good order, and of that excess which is contrary to it. If it was <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it was not in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For since God is the only good, and matter the only <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, we must necessarily say that the other things are of a middle nature, and placed as it were in the middle. But there is found to be a different framer of those things which are of a middle nature, when they say that one <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> is creative, and another admixed with matter? Perhaps, therefore, it is that primary antecedent <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> which more recent writers speak of in the book <span class="greek">&#x03C0;&#x03B5;&#x03C1;&#x03B9;<!--k29--' &#x03C4;&#x03C9;<!--k29--'&#x03BD; &#x03B4;&#x03B9;&#x03B1;&#x03C6;&#x03BF;&#x03C1;&#x03C9;<!--k29--'&#x03BD;</span>. But when the creative <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> took in hand the making of the world, then they say that there was separated from matter that which, even in the admixture, remained in its own <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, and from this the sire and the moon had their beginning. But that which to a moderate and slight degree had contracted <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, this formed the heaven and the constellations. Lastly came the rest encompassed within these, just as they might happen, which are admixtures of the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> and of matter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. The Divine Virtue in the View of the Same Manichaeus Corporeal and Divisible; The Divine Virtue Itself Matter Which Becomes Everything; This is Not Fitting</h2>

<p>I, indeed, besides all these things, wonder that they do not perceive that they are making the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> to be corporeal, and dividing it, as it were, into parts. For why, as in the case of matter, is not the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> also passible and divisible throughout, and from one of its parts the sun made, and from another the moon? For clearly this is what they assert to belong to the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; and this is what we said was the property of matter, which by itself is nothing, but when it has received form and qualities, everything is made which is divided and distinct. If, therefore, as from one subject, the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, only the sun and the moon have their beginning, and these things are different, why was anything else made? But if all things are made, what follows is manifest, that divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is matter, and that, too, such as is made into forms. But if nothing else but the sun and moon are what was created by the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, then what is intermixed with all things is the sun and moon; and each of the stars is the sun and moon, and each individual animal of. those who live on land, and of fowls, and of creatures amphibious. But this, not even those who exhibit juggling tricks would admit, as, I think, is evident to every one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Some Portions of the Virtue Have Good in Them, Others More Good; In the Sun and the Moon It is Incorrupt, in Other Things Depraved; An Improbable Opinion</h2>

<p>But if any one were to apply his mind to what follows, the road would not appear to be plain and straightforward, but more arduous even than that which has been passed. For they say that the sun and moon have contracted no stain from their admixture with matter. And now they cannot say how other things have become deteriorated contrary to their own proper nature. For if, when it was absolute and by itself, the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was so constituted that one portion of it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and another had a greater amount of goodness in it, according to the old tale of the centaurs, who as far as the breast were men, and in the lower part horses, which are both good animals, but the man is the better of the two; so also, in the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, it is to be understood that the one portion of it is the better and the more excellent, and the other will occupy the second and inferior place. And in the same way, with respect to matter, the one portion possesses, as it were, an excess of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; while others again are different, and about that other the language will be different.  For it is possible to conceive that from the beginning the sun and moon, by a more skilful and <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> judgment, chose for themselves the parts of matter that were less <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for the purposes of add mixture, that they might remain in their own perfection and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; but in the lapse of you, when the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> lost their force and became old, they brought out so much of the excess in the good, while the rest of its parts fell away, not, indeed, without foresight, and yet not with the same foresight, did each object share according to its quantity in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that was in matter. But since, with respect to this <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, nothing of a different kind is asserted by them, but it is to be understood throughout to be alike and of the same nature, their argument is improbable; because in the admixture part remains pure and incorrupt, while the other has contracted some share of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. The Light of the Moon from the Sun; The Inconvenience of the Opinion that Souls are Received in It; The Two Deluges of the Greeks</h2>

<p>Now, they say that the sun and the moon having by degrees separated the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from matter, transmit it to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But if they had only to a slight degree frequented the schools of the astronomers, it would not have happened to them to fall into these fancies, nor would they have been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that the moon, which, according to the opinion of some, is itself without light, receives its light from the sun, and that its configurations are just in proportion to its distance from the sun, and that it is then full moon when it is distant from the sun one hundred and eighty degrees. It is in conjunction when it is in the same degree with the sun. Then, is it not wonderful how it comes to pass that there should be so many <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, and from such diverse creatures? For there is the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of the world itself, and of the animals, of plants, of nymphs, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and among these are distinguished by appearance those of fowls, of land animals, and animals amphibious; but in the moon one like body is always seen by us. And what of the continuity of this body? When the moon is half-full, it appears a semicircle, and when it is in its third quarter, the same again. How then, and with what figure, are they assumed into the moon? For if it be light as fire, it is probable that they would not only ascend as far as the moon, but even higher, continually; but if it be heavy, it would not be possible for them at all to reach the moon. And what is the reason that that which first arrives at the moon is not immediately transmitted to the sun, but waits for the full moon until the rest of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> arrive? When then the moon, from having been full, decreases, where does the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> remain during that you? Until the moon, which has been emptied of the former <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, just as a desolated city, shall receive again a fresh colony. For a treasure-house should have been marked out in some part of the earth, or of the clouds, or in some other place, where the congregated <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> might stand ready for emigration to the moon. But, again, a second question arises. What then is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that it is not full immediately? Or why does it again wait fifteen days? Nor is this less to be wondered at than that which has been said, that never within the memory of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> has the moon become full after the fifteen days. Nay, not even&mdash; in  the deluge of Deucalion, nor in that of Phoroneus, when all things, so to speak, which were upon the face of the earth perished, and it happened that a great quantity of <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was separated from matter. And, besides these things, one must consider the productiveness of generations, and their barrenness, and also the destruction of them; and since these things do not happen in order, neither ought the order of the full moon, nor the these of the waning moon, to be so carefully observed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23. The Image of Matter in the Sun, After Which Man is Formed; Trifling Fancies; It is a Mere Fancy, Too, that Man. Is Formed from Matter; Man is Either a. Composite Being, or a Soul, or Mind and Understanding</h2>

<p>Neither is this to be regarded with slight attention. For if the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is in matter be <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>, those things cannot diminish it which the sun and moon fashion. For that which remains from that finite thing which has been assumed is <a href="../cathen/08004a.htm">infinite</a>. But if it is finite, it would be perceived by the senses in intervals proportionate to the amount of its <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> that had been subtracted from the world. But all things remain as they were. Now what understanding do these things not transcend in their incredibleness, when they assert that man was created and formed after the image of matter that is seen in the sun? For images are the forms of their archetypes. But if they include man's image in the sun, where is the exemplar after which his image is formed? For, indeed, they are not going to say that man is really man, or divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>; for this, indeed, they mix up with matter, And they say that the image is seen in the sun, which, as they think, was formed afterwards from the secretion of matter. Neither can they bring forward the creative <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of all things, for this they say was sent to preserve safety to the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>: so that, in their opinion, this must be altogether ascribed to the sun; for this reason, doubtless, that it happens by his arrival and presence that the sun and moon are separated from matter.</p>

<p>Moreover, they assert that the image is seen in the star; but they say that matter fashioned man. In what manner, and by what means? For it is not possible that this should fashion him. For besides that, thus according to them, man is the empty form of an empty form, and having no real <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, it has not as yet been possible to conceive how man can be the product of matter. For the use of reason and sense belongs not to that matter which they assume. Now what, according to them, is man? Is he a mixture of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and body? Or another thing, or that which is superior to the entire <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, the mind? But if he is <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, how can the more perfect and the better part be the product of that which is worse; or if he be <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> (for this they say is divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>), how can they, when they have taken away from God the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, subject this to the creating workmanship of matter? Put if they leave to him body alone, let them remember again that it is by itself immovable, and that they say that the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of matter is motion. Neither do they think that anything of itself, and its own genius, is attracted to matter. Nor is it reasonable to lay it down, that what is composed of these things is the product of this. To think, indeed, that that which is fashioned by any one is inferior to its fashioner seems to be beyond controversy. For thus the world is inferior to its Creator or Fashioner, and the works of art inferior to the artificer. If then than be the product of matter, he must surely be inferior to it. Now, men leave nothing inferior to matter; and it is not reasonable that the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should be commingled with matter, and with that which is inferior to it. But the things which they assert out of indulgence, as it were, and by way of dispensation, these they do not seem to understand. For what is the reason of their thinking that matter has bound the image of God to the substance of man? Or, why is not the image sufficient, as in a mirror, that than should appear? Or, as the sun himself is sufficient for the origination and destruction of all things that are made, has he imitated an image in the work of their creation? With which of those things which he possessed? Was it with the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which was mingled with it, so that the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should have the office of an instrument in respect of matter? Is it by unordered motion that he will thus give matter a form? But all like things, in exquisite and accurate order, by imitating, attain their end. For they do not suppose that a house, or a ship, or any other product of art, is effected by disorder; nor a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> which art has fashioned to imitate man.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. Christ is Mind, According to the Manichaeans; What is He in the View of the Church? Incongruity in Their Idea of Christ; That He Suffered Only in Appearance, a Dream of the Manichaeans; Nothing is Attributed to the Word by Way of Fiction</h2>

<p>Christ, too, they do not acknowledge; yet they speak of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but they take some other element, and giving to the Word, designating His sacred person, some other signification than that in which it is rightly received, they say that He is mind. But if, when they speak of Him as that which is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a>, and that which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, and wisdom as having the same meaning, they are found to agree with those things which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> doctors say of Him, how comes it then that they reject all that is called ancient history? But let us see whether they make Him to be something adventitious and new, and which has come on from without, and by accident, as the opinion of some is. For they who hold this opinion say, as seems very plausible, that the seventh year, when the powers of perception became distinct, He made His entrance into the body. But if Christ be <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as they <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, then will He be both Christ and not Christ. For before that mind and sense entered, He was not. But if Christ, as they will have it, be <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, then into Him already existing does the mind make its entrance, and thus, again, according to their opinion, will it be mind. Christ, therefore, is and is not at the same time. But if, according to the more approved <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a> of them, mind is all things which are, since they assume matter to be not produced, and coeval so to speak with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, this first mind and matter they hold to be Christ; if, indeed, Christ be the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which is all things, and matter is one of those things which are, and is itself not produced.</p>

<p>They say it was by way of appearance, and in this manner, that the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in matter was affixed to the cross; and that He Himself did not undergo this punishment, since it was impossible that He should suffer this; which assertion Manichaeus himself has taken in hand to teach in a book written upon the subject, that the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was enclosed in matter, and again departs from it. the mode of this they invent. That it should be said, indeed, in the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that He gave Himself up for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, obtains credit from the vulgar, and appears likewise in the Greek histories, which say that some <q>surrendered themselves to death in order to ensure safety to their countrymen.</q> And of this doctrine the Jewish history has an example, which prepares the son of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> as a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.  But to subject Christ to His <a href="../cathen/11530a.htm">passion</a> merely for the sake of display, betrays great <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, for the Word is God's representative, to teach and inform us of actual verities.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25. The Manichaean Abstinence from Living Things Ridiculous; Their Madness in Abhorring Marriage; The Mythology of the Giants; Too Allegorical an Exposition</h2>

<p>They abstain also from living things. If, indeed, the reason of their abstinence were other than it is, it ought not to be too curiously investigated. But if they do so for this reason, that the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> is more or less absent or present to them, this their meaning is ridiculous. For if plants be more material, how is it in accordance with reason to use that which is inferior for food and sustenance? Or, if there be more of the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> in them, how are things of this sort useful as food, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> faculty of nourishing and making increase is more corporeal? Now in that they abstain from marriage and the <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of Venus, fearing lest by the succession of the race the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> should dwell more in matter. I wonder how in thinking so they allow of themselves? For if neither the <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> of God suffices, both by generations and by those things which are always and in the same manner existent, to separate off the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from matter, what can the cunning and subtlety of Manichaeus effect for that purpose? For assuredly by no giant's co-operation does assistance come to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in order by the removal of generations to make the retreat of the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> from matter quick and speedy. But what the poets say about the giants is manifestly a fable. For those who lay it down about these, bring forward such matters in allegories, by a species of fable hiding the majesty of their discourse; as, for instance, when the Jewish history relates that <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> came down to hold <span class="stiki" id="note062135"><a href="../bible/gen006.htm#verse2">Genesis 6:2</a></span> intercourse with the daughters of men; for this saying signifies that the nutritive powers of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> descended from heaven to earth. But the poets who say that they, when they had emerged in full armour from the earth, perished immediately after they stirred up rebellion against the gods, in order that they might insinuate the frail and quickly-perishing constitution of the body, adorn their poetry in this way for the sake of refreshing the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> by the strangeness of the occurrence. But these, understanding nothing of all this, wheresoever they can get hold of a paralogism from whatsoever quarter it comes, greedily seize on it as a God-send, and strive with all their arts to overturn <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> by any means.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26. The Much-Talked-of Fire of the Manichaeans; That Fire Matter Itself</h2>

<p>That fire, endowed indeed with the power of burning, yet possessing no light, which is outside the world, in what region has it place? For if it is in the world, why does the world hitherto continue safe? For if at some you or other it is to destroy it, by approaching it, now also it is conjoined with it. But if it be apart from it, as it were on high in its own region, what will hereafter happen to make it descend upon the world? Or in what way will it leave its own place, and by what necessity and <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a>? And what substance of fire can be conceived without fuel, and how can what is moist serve as fuel to it, unless what is rather physiologically said about this does not fall within the province of our present disquisition? But this is quite manifest from what has been said. For the fire existing outside the world is just that which they call matter, since the sun and the moon, being the purest of the pure, by their divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, are separate and distinct from that fire, no part of them being left in it. This fire is matter itself, absolutely and <em>per se</em>, entirely removed from all admixture with the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>. Wherefore when the world has been emptied of all the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> which is opposed to it, and again a fire of this sort shall be left remaining, how then shall the fire either destroy anything, or be consumed by it? For, from that which is like, I do not see in what way corruption is to take place. For what matter will become when the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> has been separated from it, this it was before that the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> was grain-mingled with it. If indeed matter is to perish when it is bereft of the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, why did it not perish before it came in contact with the divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or any creative energy? Was it in order that matter might successively perish, and do this ad <em>infinitum</em>? And what is the use of this? For that which had not place from the first volition, how shall this have place from one following? Or what reason is there for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to put off things which, not even in the case of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, appears to be well? For as regards those who deliberate about what is impossible, this is said to happen to them, that they do not wish for that which is possible. But if nothing else, they speak of God transcending substance, and bring Him forward as some new material, and that not such as intelligent men always think to be joined with Him, but that which investigation discovers either to be not existing at all, or to be the extreme of all things, and which can with difficulty be conceived of by the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> mind. For this fire, devoid of light, is it of more force than matter, which is to be left desolate by divine <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, or is it of less? And if it is of less, how will it overcome that which is of more? But if it is of more, it will be able to bring it back to itself, being of the same nature; yet will it not destroy it, as neither does the Nile swallow up the streams that are divided off from it.</p>
