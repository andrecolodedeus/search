<h1>On Baptism</h1>

<h2 id="chapter1">Chapter 1. Introduction. Origin of the Treatise</h2>

<p>Happy is our  sacrament of water, in that, by washing away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of our early blindness, we are set free <em>and admitted</em> into <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life! A treatise on this matter will not be superfluous; instructing not only such as are just becoming formed (in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>), but them who, content with having simply <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, without full examination of the grounds  of the traditions, carry (in mind), through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, an untried <em>though</em> probable <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. The consequence is, that a viper of the Cainite <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, lately conversant in this quarter, has carried away a great number with her most venomous doctrine, making it her first aim to destroy <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Which is quite in accordance with nature; for vipers and asps and basilisks themselves generally do affect arid and waterless places. But we, little fishes, after the example of our <span class="greek">&#x0399;&#x03A7;&#x0398;&#x03A5;&#x03A3;</span>  <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, are born in water, nor have we safety in any other way than by permanently abiding in water; so that most monstrous creature, who had no right to teach even sound doctrine,  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> full well how to kill the little fishes, by taking them away from the water!</p>

<h2 id="chapter2">Chapter 2. The Very Simplicity of God's Means of Working, a Stumbling-Block to the Carnal Mind</h2>

<p>Well, but how great is the force of perversity for <em>so</em> shaking the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> or entirely preventing its reception, that it impugns it on the very principles of which <em>the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a></em> consists! There is absolutely nothing which makes men's minds more obdurate than the simplicity of the divine works which are visible in the <em>act</em>, when compared with the grandeur which is promised thereto in the <em>effect</em>; so that from the very fact, that with so great simplicity, without pomp, without any considerable novelty of preparation, finally, without expense, a man is dipped in water, and amid the utterance of some few words, is sprinkled, and then rises again, not much (or not at all) the cleaner, the consequent attainment of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a>  is esteemed the more incredible. I am a deceiver if, on the contrary, it is not from their circumstance, and preparation, and expense, that <em><a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a></em>' solemnities or <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> get their credit and authority built up. Oh, miserable incredulity, which quite deniest to God His own properties, simplicity and power! What then? Is it not wonderful, too, that death should be washed away by bathing? But it is the more to be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> if the wonderfulness be the reason why it is <em>not</em> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>. For what does it behoove divine works to be in their quality, except that they be above all wonder?  We also ourselves wonder, but it is <em>because</em> we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>. Incredulity, on the other hand, wonders, but does <em>not</em> <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>: for the simple <em>acts</em> it wonders at, as if they were vain; the grand <em>results</em>, as if they were impossible. And grant that it be just as you think  sufficient to meet each point is the divine declaration which has forerun: <q>The foolish things of the world has God elected to confound its wisdom;</q>  and, <q>The things very difficult with men are easy with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  For if God is wise and powerful (which even they who pass Him by do not deny), it is with good reason that He lays the material causes of His own operation in the contraries of wisdom and of power, that is, in foolishness and impossibility; since every <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> receives its <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> from those things by which it is called forth.</p>

<h2 id="chapter3">Chapter 3. Water Chosen as a Vehicle of Divine Operation and Wherefore. Its Prominence First of All in Creation</h2>

<p>Mindful of this declaration as of a conclusive prescript, we nevertheless <em>proceed to</em> treat <em>the question</em>, <q>How <em>foolish</em> and <em>impossible</em> it is to be formed anew by water. In what respect, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, has this material substance merited an office of so high dignity?</q> The authority, I suppose, of the liquid element has to be examined.  This  however, is found in abundance, and that from the very beginning. For <em>water</em> is one of those things which, before all the furnishing of the world, were quiescent with God in a yet unshapen  state. <q>In the first beginning,</q> says <em>Scripture</em>, <q><a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made the heaven and the earth. But the earth was invisible, and unorganized,  and darkness was over the abyss; and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of the Lord</a> was hovering  over the waters.</q>  The first thing, O man, which you have to venerate, is the <em>age</em> of the waters in that their substance is ancient; the second, their <em>dignity</em>, in that they were the seat of the Divine Spirit, more pleasing <em>to Him</em>, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, than all the other then existing elements. For the darkness was total thus far, shapeless, without the ornament of stars; and the abyss gloomy; and the earth unfurnished; and the heaven unwrought: water  alone&mdash; always a perfect, gladsome, simple material substance, pure in itself&mdash; supplied a worthy vehicle to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. What <em>of the fact</em> that waters were in some way the regulating powers by which the disposition of the world thenceforward was constituted by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>? For the suspension of the celestial firmament in the midst He caused by <q>dividing the waters;</q>  the suspension of <q>the dry land</q> He accomplished by <q>separating the waters.</q> After the world had been hereupon set in order through <em>its</em> elements, when inhabitants were given it, <q>the waters</q> were the first to receive the precept <q>to bring forth living creatures.</q>  Water was the first to produce that which had life, that it might be no wonder in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> if waters <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to give life.  For was not the work of fashioning man himself also achieved with the aid of waters? Suitable material is found in the <em>earth</em>, yet not apt for the purpose unless it be moist and juicy; which (earth) <q>the waters,</q> separated the fourth day before into their own place, temper with their remaining moisture to a clayey consistency. If, from that time onward, I go forward in recounting universally, or at more length, the evidences of the <q>authority</q> of this element which I can adduce to show how great is its power or its <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; how many ingenious devices, how many functions, how useful an instrumentality, it affords the world, I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> I may seem to have collected rather the praises of water than the reasons of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; although I should <em>thereby</em> teach all the more fully, that it is not to be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a> that God has made the material substance which He has disposed throughout all His products  and works, <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> Him also in His own peculiar <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>; that the <em>material substance</em> which governs terrestrial life acts as agent likewise in the celestial.</p>

<h2 id="chapter4">Chapter 4. The Primeval Hovering of the Spirit of God Over the Waters Typical of Baptism. The Universal Element of Water Thus Made a Channel of Sanctification. Resemblance Between the Outward Sign and the Inward Grace</h2>

<p>But it will suffice to have <em>thus</em> called at the outset those points in which withal is recognised that primary principle of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash;which was even then fore-noted by the very attitude <em>assumed</em> for a type of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash;that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, who hovered over (the waters) from the beginning, would continue to linger over the waters of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.  But a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing, of course, hovered over a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; or else, from that which hovered over that which <em>was</em> hovered over borrowed a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, since it is necessary that in every case an underlying material substance should catch the quality of that which overhangs it, most of all a corporeal of a spiritual, adapted (as the spiritual is) through the subtleness of its substance, both for penetrating and insinuating. Thus the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the waters, sanctified by the Holy One, itself conceived withal the power of sanctifying. Let no one say, <q>Why then, are we, <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the very waters which then <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in the first beginning?</q> Not with those waters, of course, except in so far as the <em>genus</em> indeed is one, but the <em>species</em> very many. But what is an attribute to the <em>genus</em> reappears  likewise in the <em>species</em>. And accordingly it makes no difference whether a man be washed in a sea or a pool, a stream or a fount, a lake or a trough;  nor is there any distinction between those whom John <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Jordan and those whom Peter <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Tiber, unless withal the eunuch whom Philip <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the midst of his journeys with chance water, derived (therefrom) more or less of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> <em>than others</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note038565"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse26">Acts&nbsp;8:26-40</a></span> All waters, therefore, in virtue of the pristine privilege of their origin, do, after invocation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, attain the sacramental power of sanctification; for the Spirit immediately supervenes from the heavens, and rests over the waters, sanctifying them from Himself; and being thus sanctified, they imbibe at the same time the power of sanctifying. Albeit the similitude may be admitted to be suitable to the simple act; that, since we are defiled by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as it were by dirt, we should be washed from those stains in waters. But as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> do not show themselves in our <em>flesh</em> (inasmuch as no one carries on his skin the spot of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, or fornication, or fraud), so <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of that kind are foul in the <em>spirit</em>, which is the author of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; for the spirit is lord, the flesh servant. Yet they each mutually share the guilt: the spirit, on the ground of command; the flesh, of subservience. Therefore, after the waters have been in a manner endued with medicinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>  through the intervention of the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>,  the spirit is corporeally washed in the waters, and the flesh is in the same spiritually cleansed.</p>

<h2 id="chapter5">Chapter 5. Use Made of Water by the Heathen. Type of the Angel at the Pool of Bethsaida.</h2> 

<p><q>Well, but the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, who are strangers to all understanding of spiritual powers, ascribe to their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> the imbuing of waters with the self-same efficacy.</q> (So they do) but they cheat themselves with waters which are widowed.  For washing is the channel through which they are initiated into some sacred <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a>&mdash; of some notorious Isis or <a href="../cathen/10402a.htm">Mithras</a>. The gods themselves likewise they <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> by washings. Moreover, by carrying water around, and sprinkling it, they everywhere expiate  country-seats, houses, temples, and whole cities: at all events, at the <a href="../cathen/01615b.htm">Apollinarian</a> and Eleusinian games they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and they presume that the effect of their doing that is their regeneration and the remission of the penalties due to their <a href="../cathen/11696a.htm">perjuries</a>. Among the ancients, again, whoever had defiled himself with <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>, was wont to go in quest of purifying waters. Therefore, if the mere nature of water, in that it is the appropriate material for washing away, leads men to flatter themselves with a belief in omens of purification, how much more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> will waters render that service through the authority of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whom all their nature has been constituted! If men think that water is endued with a medicinal <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a> by religion, what religion is more effectual than that of the living God? Which fact being acknowledged, we recognise here also the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> rivalling the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  while we find him, too, practising <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in his <em>subjects</em>. What similarity is there? The unclean cleanses! The ruiner sets free! The damned absolves! He will, forsooth, destroy his own work, by washing away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which himself inspires! These (remarks) have been set down by way of testimony against such as reject the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; if they put no trust in the things of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the spurious imitations of which, in the case of God's rival, they do trust in. Are there not other cases too, in which, without any sacrament, unclean spirits brood on waters, in spurious imitation of that brooding  of the Divine Spirit in the very beginning? Witness all shady founts, and all unfrequented brooks, and the ponds in the baths, and the conduits  in <em>private</em> houses, or the cisterns and wells which are said to have the property of <q>spiriting away,</q>  through the power, that is, of a hurtful spirit. Men whom waters have drowned  or affected with <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> or with <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, they call nymph-caught,  or <q>lymphatic,</q> or <q>hydro-phobic.</q> Why have we adduced these instances? Lest any think it too hard <em>for belief</em> that a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> of God should grant his presence to waters, to temper them to man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; while the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> holds frequent profane commerce with the selfsame element to man's ruin. If it seems a novelty for an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> to be present in waters, an example of what was to come to pass has forerun. An <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, by his intervention, was wont to stir the pool at <a href="../cathen/02536a.htm">Bethsaida</a>.  They who were complaining of ill-health used to watch for him; for whoever had been the first to descend into them, after his washing, ceased to complain. This figure of corporeal healing sang of a spiritual healing, according to the rule by which things carnal are always antecedent  as figurative of things spiritual. And thus, when the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God advanced to higher degrees among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note038579"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;1:16-17</a></span> an accession <em>of efficacy</em> was granted to the waters and to the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>. They who  were wont to remedy bodily defects,  now heal the spirit; they who used to work temporal <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>  now renew <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>; they who did set free but once in the year, now save peoples in a body  daily, death being done away through ablution of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. The guilt being removed, of course the penalty is removed too. Thus man will be restored for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> to His <q>likeness,</q> who in days bygone had been <em>conformed</em> to <q>the image</q> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; (the <q>image</q> is counted (to be) in his <em>form</em>: the <q>likeness</q> in his <em><a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternity</a></em>:) for he receives again that <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a> which he had then first received from His <em>afflatus</em>, but had afterward lost through <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter6">Chapter 6. The Angel the Forerunner of the Holy Spirit. Meaning Contained in the Baptismal Formula</h2>

<p>Not that <em>in</em>  the waters we obtain the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; but in the water, under (the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> of) the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, we are cleansed, and prepared <em>for</em> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>. In this case also a type has preceded; for thus was John beforehand the Lord's forerunner, <q>preparing His ways.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038585"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse76">Luke&nbsp;1:76</a></span> Thus, too, does the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>  of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <q>make the paths straight</q>  for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who is about to come upon us, by the washing away of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, sealed in (the name of) the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, obtains. For if <q>in <em>the mouth of</em> three witnesses every word shall stand:</q> &mdash; while, through the benediction, we have the same (three) as witnesses of our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> whom we have as sureties  of our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> too&mdash; how much more does the number of the divine names suffice for the assurance of our hope likewise! Moreover, after the pledging both of the attestation of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and the promise  of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> under <q>three witnesses,</q> there is added, of necessity, mention of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>;  inasmuch as, wherever there are three, (that is, the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>,) there is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is a body of three. </p>

<h2 id="chapter7">Chapter 7. Of the Unction</h2>

<p>After this, when we have issued from the font,  we are thoroughly anointed with a blessed unction,&mdash; (a practice derived) from the old discipline, wherein on entering the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, <em>men</em> were wont to be anointed with oil from a horn, ever since <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was anointed by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>.  Whence <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> is called <q>Christ,</q>  from the <q>chrism,</q> which is <q>the unction;</q> which, when made spiritual, furnished an appropriate name to the Lord, because He was <q>anointed</q> with the Spirit by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father; as <em>written</em> in the Acts: <q>For <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> they were gathered together in this city  against Your Holy Son whom You have anointed.</q>  Thus, too, in <em>our</em> case, the unction runs carnally, (<em>i.e.</em> on the body,) but profits spiritually; in the same way as the <em>act</em> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself too is carnal, in that we are plunged in water, <em>but</em> the <em>effect</em> spiritual, in that we are freed from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter8">Chapter 8. Of the Imposition of Hands. Types of the Deluge and the Dove</h2>

<p>In the next place the hand is laid on us, invoking and inviting the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> through benediction.  Shall it be granted possible for <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> ingenuity to summon a spirit into water, and, by the application of hands from above, to animate their union into one body  with another spirit of so clear sound;  and shall it not be possible for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the case of His own organ,  to produce, by means of <q><a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> hands,</q>  a sublime spiritual modulation? But this, as well as the former, is derived from the old sacramental rite in which Jacob blessed his grandsons, born of Joseph, Ephrem  and Manasses; with his hands laid on them and interchanged, and indeed so transversely slanted one over the other, that, by delineating Christ, they even portended the future benediction into Christ.  Then, over our cleansed and blessed bodies willingly descends from the Father that Holiest Spirit. Over the waters of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, recognising as it were His primeval seat,  He reposes: (He who) glided down on the Lord <q>in the shape of a dove,</q>  in order that the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> might be declared by means of the creature (the emblem) of simplicity and innocence, because even in her bodily structure the dove is without literal  gall. And accordingly He says, <q>Be simple as doves.</q>  Even this is not without the supporting evidence  of a preceding figure. For just as, after the waters of the deluge, by which the old iniquity was purged&mdash; after the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so to say, of the world&mdash; a <em>dove</em> was the herald which announced to the earth the assuagement  of celestial <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, when she had been sent her way out of the ark, and had returned with the olive-branch, a sign which even among the nations is the fore-token of <em>peace</em>;  so by the self-same law  of heavenly effect, to earth&mdash; that is, to our flesh &mdash; as it emerges from the font,  after its old <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> flies the <em>dove</em> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, bringing us the peace of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, sent out from the heavens where is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the typified ark.  But the world returned unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; in which point <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> would ill be compared to the deluge. And so it is destined to fire; just as the man too is, who after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> renews his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>:  so that this also ought to be accepted as a sign for our admonition.</p>

<h2 id="chapter10">Chapter 10. Of John's Baptism</h2>

<p>We have spoken, so far as our moderate ability permitted, of the <em>generals</em> which form the groundwork of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a>  of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. I will now, equally to the best of my power, proceed to the rest of its character, touching certain minor questions.</p>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> announced by John formed the subject, even at that time, of a question, proposed by the Lord Himself indeed to the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, whether that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> were heavenly, or <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> earthly:  about which they were unable to give a consistent  answer, inasmuch as they understood not, because they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> not. But <em>we</em>, with but as poor a measure of understanding as of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, <em>are</em> able to determine that that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was <em>divine</em> indeed, (yet in respect of the command, not in respect of efficacy  too, in that we read that John was <em>sent by the Lord</em> to perform this duty,)  but <em><a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a></em> in its nature: for it conveyed nothing celestial, but it fore-ministered to things celestial; being, to wit, appointed over <em>repentance</em>, which is in man's power.  In fact, the doctors of the law and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, who were unwilling to <q><a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>,</q> did not <q>repent</q> either.  But if repentance is a thing <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, its <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> must necessarily be of the same nature: else, if it had been celestial, it would have given both the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> and remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But none either pardons <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> or freely grants the Spirit save God only.  Even the Lord Himself said that the Spirit would not descend on any other condition, but that He should first ascend to the Father. <span class="stiki" id="note038644"><a href="../bible/joh016.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;16:6-7</a></span> What the Lord was not yet conferring, of course the servant could not furnish. Accordingly, in the Acts of the Apostles, we find that men who had <q>John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a></q> had not received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, whom they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> not even by hearing.  That, then, was no celestial thing which furnished no celestial (endowments): whereas the very thing which <em>was</em> celestial in John&mdash; the Spirit of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>&mdash; so completely failed, after the transfer of the whole Spirit to the Lord, that he presently sent to inquire whether He whom he had himself preached,  whom he had pointed out when coming to him, were <q>HE.</q>  And so <q>the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of repentance</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038648"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;19:4</a></span> was dealt with  as if it were a candidate for the remission and sanctification shortly about to follow in Christ: for in that John used to preach <q><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <em>for</em> the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038650"><a href="../bible/mar001.htm#verse4">Mark&nbsp;1:4</a></span> the declaration was made with reference to <em>future</em> remission; if it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, (as it is,) that repentance is antecedent, remission subsequent; and this is <q>preparing the way.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038651"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse76">Luke&nbsp;1:76</a></span> But he who <q>prepares</q> does not himself <q>perfect,</q> but procures for another to perfect. John himself professes that the celestial things are not his, but Christ's, by saying, <q>He who is from the earth speaks concerning the earth; He who comes from the <em>realms</em> above is above all;</q>  and again, by saying that he <q><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in repentance only, but that One would shortly come who would <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a> and fire;</q> &mdash; of course because <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> and stable <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <em>water</em>, unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; pretended and weak <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with <em>fire</em>, unto judgment.</p>

<h2 id="chapter11">Chapter 11. Answer to the Objection that <q>The Lord Did Not Baptize.</q></h2>

<p>But behold, say some, <q>the Lord came, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not; for we read, 'And yet He used not to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>!'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038654"><a href="../bible/joh004.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;4:2</a></span> As if, in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, John had preached that He would <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with His own hands! Of course, his words are not so to be understood, but as simply spoken after an ordinary manner; just as, for instance, we say, <q>The emperor set forth an edict,</q> or, <q>The prefect cudgelled him.</q> Pray does the emperor in person set forth, or the prefect in person cudgel? One whose ministers do a thing is always said to do it.  So <q>He will <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you</q> will have to be understood as standing for, <q>Through Him,</q> or <q>Into Him,</q> <q>you will be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</q> But let not (the fact) that <q>He Himself <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> not</q> trouble any. For into whom should He <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>? Into repentance? Of what use, then, do you make His forerunner? Into remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which He used to give by a word? Into Himself, whom by humility He was concealing? Into the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who had not yet descended from the Father? Into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> had not yet founded? And thus it was with the selfsame <q><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John</q> that His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> used to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, as ministers, with which John before had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> as forerunner. Let none think it was with some other, because no other exists, except that of Christ subsequently; which at that time, of course, could not be given by His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, inasmuch as the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the Lord had not yet been fully attained,  nor the efficacy of the font  established through the passion and the resurrection; because neither can our death see dissolution except by the Lord's passion, nor our life be restored without His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter12">Chapter 12. Of the Necessity of Baptism to Salvation</h2>

<p>When, however, the prescript is laid down that <q>without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is attainable by none</q> (chiefly on the ground of that declaration of the Lord, who says, <q>Unless one be born of water, he has not life</q> ), there arise immediately scrupulous, nay rather audacious, doubts on the part of some, <q>how, in accordance with that prescript, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is attainable by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, whom&mdash; <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> excepted&mdash; we do not find <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the Lord? Nay, since <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> is the only one of them who has put on <em>the garment of</em> Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,  either the peril of all the others who lack the water of Christ is prejudged, that the prescript may be maintained, or else the prescript is rescinded if <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> has been ordained even for the unbaptized.</q> I have heard&mdash; the Lord is my <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>&mdash; doubts of that kind: that none may <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a> me so abandoned as to excogitate, unprovoked, in the licence of my pen, ideas which would inspire others with scruple.</p>

<p>And now, as far as I shall be able, I will reply to them who affirm <q>that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were unbaptized.</q> For if they had undergone the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, and were longing for that of the Lord, <em>then</em> since the Lord Himself had defined <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be <em>one</em>;  (saying to Peter, who was desirous  of being thoroughly bathed, <q>He who has once bathed has no necessity <em>to wash</em> a second time;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038662"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse9">John&nbsp;13:9-10</a></span> which, of course, He would not have said at all to one <em>not</em> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>;) even here we have a conspicuous  <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> against those who, in order to destroy the sacrament of water, deprive the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> even of John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Can it seem credible that <q>the way of the Lord,</q> that is, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, had not then been <q>prepared</q> in those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who were being destined to <em>open</em> the way of the Lord throughout the whole world? The Lord Himself, though no <q>repentance</q> was due from <em>Him</em>, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> not necessary for <em>sinners</em>? As for the fact, then, that <q>others were not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a></q>&mdash; they, however, were not companions of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but enemies of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, doctors of the law and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>. From which fact is gathered an additional suggestion, that, since the <em>opposers</em> of the Lord <em>refused</em> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they who <em>followed</em> the Lord <em>were</em> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and were not like-minded with their own rivals: especially when, if there were any one to whom they clave, the Lord had exalted John above him (by the testimony) saying, <q>Among them who are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> <em>there is</em> none greater than John the Baptist.</q> </p>

<p>Others make the suggestion (forced enough, clearly <q>that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> then served the turn of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> when in their little ship, were sprinkled and covered with the waves: that Peter himself also was immersed enough when he walked on the sea.</q>  It is, however, as I think, one thing to be sprinkled or intercepted by the <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> of the sea; another thing to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to the discipline of religion. But that little ship did present a figure of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in that she is disquieted <q>in the sea,</q> that is, in the world,  <q>by the waves,</q> that is, by <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecutions</a> and <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a>; the Lord, through patience, sleeping as it were, until, roused in their last extremities by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, He checks the world,  and restores tranquillity to His own.</p>

<p>Now, whether they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in any manner whatever, or whether they continued unbathed  to the end&mdash; so that even that saying of the Lord touching the <q>one bath</q>  does, under the person of Peter, merely regard <em>us</em>&mdash; still, to determine concerning the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> is audacious enough, because on <em>them</em> the prerogative even of first choice,  and thereafter of undivided intimacy, might be able to confer the compendious <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, seeing they (I think) followed Him who was wont to promise <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to every believer. <q>Your <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> He would say, <q>has saved you;</q>  and, <q>Your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> shall be remitted you,</q>  on your believing, of course, albeit you be not <em>yet</em> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. If that  was wanting to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of what things it was, that, roused by one word of the Lord, <em>one</em> left the toll-booth behind for ever; <span class="stiki" id="note038674"><a href="../bible/mat009.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;9:9</a></span> <em>another</em> deserted father and ship, and the craft by which he gained his living; <span class="stiki" id="note038675"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse21">Matthew&nbsp;4:21-22</a></span> <em>a third</em>, who disdained his father's obsequies,  fulfilled, before he heard it, that highest precept of the Lord, <q>He who prefers father or mother to me, is not worthy of me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038677"><a href="../bible/mat010.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;10:37</a></span> </p>

<h2 id="chapter13">Chapter 13. Another Objection: Abraham Pleased God Without Being Baptized. Answer Thereto. Old Things Must Give Place to New, and Baptism is Now a Law</h2>

<p>Here, then, those miscreants  provoke questions. And so they say, <q>Baptism is not necessary for them to whom <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is sufficient; for withal, <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> pleased God by a sacrament of no water, but of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> But in all cases it is the <em>later</em> things which have a conclusive force, and the <em>subsequent</em> which prevail over the antecedent. Grant that, in days gone by, there was <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by means of bare <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, before the passion and resurrection of the Lord. But now that <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> has been enlarged, and has become a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which believes in His nativity, passion, and resurrection, there has been an amplification added to the sacrament,  viz., the sealing act of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; the clothing, in some sense, of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which before was bare, and which cannot exist now without its proper law. For the <em>law</em> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> has been <em>imposed</em>, and the formula prescribed: <q>Go,</q> <em>He</em> says, <q>teach the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them into the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>.</q>  The comparison with this law of that definition, <q>Unless a man have been reborn of water and Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of the heavens,</q>  has tied <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Accordingly, all thereafter  <em>who became</em> <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> used to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. <em>Then</em> it was, too,  that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, when he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and this is the meaning of the precept which the Lord had given him when smitten with the plague of loss <em>of sight</em>, saying, <q>Arise, and enter Damascus; there shall be demonstrated to you what you ought to do,</q> to wit&mdash; be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, which was the only thing lacking to him. That point excepted, he had sufficiently <em>learned and <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a></em> <q>the Nazarene</q> to be <q>the Lord, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>.</q> </p>

However, even if Christ had not sent <em>him</em> to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, yet He had given <em>other</em> <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> the precept to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. But these words were written to the Corinthians in regard of the circumstances of that particular time; seeing that schisms and dissensions were agitated among them, while one attributes <em>everything</em> to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, another to Apollos.  For which reason the <q>peace-making</q>  apostle, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> he should seem to claim all <em>gifts</em> for himself, says that he had been sent <q>not to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but to preach.</q> For preaching is the prior thing, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> the posterior. Therefore the preaching came <em>first</em>: but I think <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> withal was <em>lawful</em> to him to whom preaching was.</p>

<h2 id="chapter15">Chapter 15. Unity of Baptism. Remarks on Heretical And Jewish Baptism</h2>

<p>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not whether any further point is mooted to bring <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> into controversy. Permit me to call to mind what I have omitted above, lest I seem to break off the train of impending thoughts in the middle. There is to us one, and but one, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; as well according to the Lord's gospel  as according to the apostle's letters,  inasmuch as <em>he says</em>, <q>One <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and one church in the heavens.</q>  But it must be admitted that the question, <q>What rules are to be observed with regard to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>?</q> is worthy of being treated. For it is to <em>us</em>  that that assertion  refers. Heretics, however, have no fellowship in our discipline, whom the mere fact of their excommunication  testifies to be outsiders. I am not bound to recognize in <em>them</em> a thing which is enjoined on <em>me</em>, because they and we have not the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, nor one&mdash; that is, <em>the same</em>&mdash; Christ. And therefore their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not one <em>with ours</em> either, because it is not <em>the same; a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a></em> which, since they have it not duly, doubtless they have <em>not at all</em>; nor is that capable of being <em>counted</em> which is not <em>had</em>. <span class="stiki" id="note038695"><a href="../bible/ecc001.htm#verse15">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;1:15</a></span> Thus they cannot <em>receive</em> it either, because they <em>have it not</em>. But this point has already received a fuller discussion from us in Greek. We enter, then, the font  <em>once: once</em> are <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> washed away, because they ought never to be repeated. But the Jewish <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> bathes daily,  because he is daily being defiled: and, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that <em>defilement</em> should be practised among <em>us</em> also, therefore was the definition touching the one bathing  made. Happy water, which <em>once</em> washes away; which does not mock sinners (with vain hopes); which does not, by being infected with the repetition of impurities, again defile them whom it has washed!</p>

<h2 id="chapter16">Chapter 16. Of the Second Baptism&mdash; With Blood</h2>

<p>We <em>have</em> indeed, likewise, a <em>second</em> font,  (itself withal <em>one with the former</em>,) of <em>blood</em>, to wit; concerning which the Lord said, <q>I have to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,</q>  when He had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> already. For He had come <q>by means of water and blood,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038701"><a href="../bible/1jo005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;5:6</a></span> just as John has written; that He might be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the water, <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a> by the blood; to make <em>us</em>, in like manner, <em>called</em> by <em>water, chosen</em>  by <em>blood</em>. These two baptisms He sent out from the wound in His pierced side,  in order that they who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in His blood might be bathed with the water; they who had been bathed in the water might likewise drink the blood.  This is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which both stands in lieu of the fontal bathing  when that has not been received, and restores it when lost.</p>

<h2 id="chapter17">Chapter 17. Of the Power of Conferring Baptism</h2>

<p>For concluding our brief subject,  it remains to put you in mind also of the due observance of giving and receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Of giving it, the chief <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>  (who is the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>) has the right: in the next place, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyters</a> and <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, yet not without the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop's</a> authority, on account of the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which being preserved, peace is preserved. Beside these, even <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a> have the right; for what is equally received can be equally given. Unless <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, or <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacons</a>, be on the spot, <em>other</em> <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are called <em>i.e. to the work</em>. The word of the Lord ought not to be hidden by any: in like manner, too, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is equally God's property,  can be administered by all. But how much more is the rule  of reverence and modesty incumbent on <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>&mdash; seeing that these <em>powers</em>  belong to their superiors&mdash; lest they assume to themselves the <em>specific</em>  function of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>! Emulation of the episcopal office is the mother of schisms. The most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> apostle has said, that <q>all things are <em>lawful</em>, but not all <em>expedient</em>.</q>  Let it suffice assuredly, in cases of <em>necessity</em>, to avail yourself (of that rule , if at any time circumstance either of place, or of time, or of person compels you (so to do); for <em>then</em> the steadfast <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> of the succourer, when the situation of the endangered one is urgent, is exceptionally admissible; inasmuch as he will be guilty of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> creature's loss if he shall refrain from bestowing what he had free liberty to bestow. But the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> of pertness,  who has usurped the power to teach, will of course not give birth for herself likewise to a right of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, unless some new beast shall arise  like the former; so that, just as the one abolished <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,  so some other should in her own right confer it! But if the writings which wrongly go under <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> name, claim Thecla's example as a licence for <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women's</a> teaching and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, in Asia, the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">presbyter</a> who composed that writing,  as if he were augmenting <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul's</a> fame from his own store, after being convicted, and confessing that he had done it from <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, was removed  from his office. For how credible would it seem, that he who has not permitted a <em><a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a></em>  even to <em>learn</em> with over-boldness, should give a <em>female</em>  the power of <em>teaching</em> and of <em><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a></em>! <q>Let them be silent,</q> he says, <q>and at home consult their own husbands.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038721"><a href="../bible/1co014.htm#verse34">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;14:34-35</a></span> </p>

<h2 id="chapter18">Chapter 18. Of the Persons to Whom, and the Time When, Baptism is to Be Administered</h2>

<p>But they whose office it is, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not rashly to be administered. <q>Give to every one who begs you,</q>  has a reference of its own, appertaining especially to almsgiving. On the contrary, this <em>precept</em> is rather to be looked at carefully: <q>Give not the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038723"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;7:6</a></span> and, <q>Lay not hands easily on <em>any</em>; share not other men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  If Philip so <q>easily</q> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> the chamberlain, let us reflect that a manifest and conspicuous  evidence that the Lord deemed him worthy had been interposed. <span class="stiki" id="note038726"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse26">Acts&nbsp;8:26-40</a></span> The Spirit had enjoined Philip to proceed to that road: the eunuch himself, too, was not found idle, nor as one who was suddenly seized with an eager desire to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; but, after going up to the temple for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer's</a> sake, being intently engaged on the <a href="../bible/index.html">divine Scripture</a>, was thus suitably discovered&mdash; to whom God had, unasked, sent an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, which one, again, the Spirit bade adjoin himself to the chamberlain's chariot. The Scripture which <em>he was reading</em> falls in opportunely with his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>: <em>Philip</em>, being requested, is taken to sit beside him; the Lord is pointed out; <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> lingers not; water needs no waiting for; the work is completed, and the apostle snatched away. <q>But <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> too was, in fact, 'speedily' <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>:</q> for Simon,  his host, speedily recognized him to be <q>an appointed vessel of election.</q> God's approbation sends sure premonitory tokens before it; every <q>petition</q>  may both deceive and be deceived. And so, according to the circumstances and disposition, and even age, of each individual, the delay of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is preferable; principally, however, in the case of little children. For why is it necessary&mdash; if (<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself) is not so necessary &mdash; that the sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger? Who both themselves, by reason of mortality, may fail to fulfil their promises, and may be disappointed by the development of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> disposition, <em>in those for whom they stood</em>? The Lord does indeed say, <q>Forbid them not to come unto me.</q>  Let them <q>come,</q> then, while they are growing up; let them <q>come</q> while they are learning, while they are learning whither to come;  let them become <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>  when they have become able to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> Christ. Why does the innocent period of life hasten to the <q>remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?</q> More caution will be exercised in worldly  matters: so that one who is <em>not</em> trusted with earthly substance <em>is</em> trusted with divine! Let them <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to <q>ask</q> for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that you may seem (at least) to have given <q>to him that asks.</q>  For no less <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> must the unwedded also be deferred&mdash; in whom <em>the ground of</em> <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> is prepared, alike in such as <em>never were</em> wedded  by means of their maturity, and in the <em>widowed</em> by means of their freedom&mdash; until they either marry, or else be more fully strengthened for continence. If any understand the weighty import of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, they will <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> its reception more than its delay: sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is secure of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter19">Chapter 19. Of the Times Most Suitable for Baptism</h2>

<p>The <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> affords a more <em>than usually</em> solemn day for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; when, withal, the Lord's passion, in which we are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, was completed. Nor will it be incongruous to interpret figuratively <em>the fact</em> that, when the Lord was about to celebrate the last <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a>, He said to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> who were sent to make preparation, <q>You will meet a man bearing water.</q>  He points out the place for celebrating the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> by the sign of <em>water</em>. After that, Pentecost is a most joyous space  for conferring baptisms;  wherein, too, the resurrection of the Lord was repeatedly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>  among the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and the hope of the advent of the Lord indirectly pointed to, in that, at that time, when He had been received back into the heavens, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>  told the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that <q>He would so come, as He had withal ascended into the heavens;</q>  at Pentecost, of course. But, moreover, when Jeremiah says, <q>And I will gather them together from the extremities of the land in the feast-day,</q> he signifies the day of the <a href="../cathen/11512b.htm">Passover</a> and of Pentecost, which is properly a <q>feast-day.</q>  However, <em>every</em> day is the Lord's; every hour, every time, is apt for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: if there is a difference in the <em><a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a></em>, distinction there is none in the <em><a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a></em>.</p>

<h2 id="chapter20">Chapter 20. Of Preparation For, and Conduct After, the Reception of Baptism</h2>

<p>They who are about to enter <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> with repeated <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, <a href="../cathen/05789c.htm">fasts</a>, and bendings of the knee, and <a href="../cathen/05647a.htm">vigils</a> all the night through, and with the confession of all by- gone <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that they may express <em>the meaning</em> even of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John: <q>They were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>,</q> says (the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>), <q>confessing their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q>  To us it is matter for thankfulness if we do <em>now</em> publicly confess our iniquities or our turpitudes:  for we do at the same time both make satisfaction  for our former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, by mortification of our flesh and <a href="../cathen/14220b.htm">spirit</a>, and lay beforehand the foundation of defences against the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> which will closely follow. <q>Watch and <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a>,</q> says (the Lord), <q>lest you fall into <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038747"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;26:41</a></span> And the reason, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, why they <em>were</em> tempted was, that they fell asleep; so that they deserted the Lord when apprehended, and he who continued to stand by Him, and used the sword, even denied Him thrice: for withal the word had gone before, that <q>no one <em>un</em>tempted should attain the celestial kingdoms.</q>  The Lord Himself immediately after <em><a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a></em>  <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> surrounded, when in forty days He had kept fast. <q>Then,</q> some one will say, <q>it becomes <em>us</em>, too, rather to fast <em>after</em> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</q>  Well, and who forbids you, unless it be the necessity for <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, and the thanksgiving for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? But so far as I, with my poor powers, understand, the Lord figuratively retorted upon <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a> the reproach <em>they had cast on the Lord</em>.  For the people, after crossing the sea, and being carried about in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> during forty years, although they were there nourished with divine supplies, nevertheless were more mindful of their belly and their gullet than of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Thereupon the Lord, driven apart into desert places after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,  showed, by maintaining a fast of forty days, that the man of God lives <q>not by bread alone,</q> but <q>by the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note038753"><a href="../bible/mat004.htm#verse1">Matthew&nbsp;4:1-4</a></span> and that <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptations</a> incident to fullness or immoderation of appetite are shattered by abstinence. Therefore, blessed <em>ones</em>, whom the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God awaits, when you ascend from that most sacred font  of your new birth, and spread your hands  for the first time in the house of your mother,  together with your brethren, ask from the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, ask from the Lord, that His own specialties of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> <em>and</em> distributions of gifts <span class="stiki" id="note038757"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse4">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:4-12</a></span> may be supplied you. <q>Ask,</q> says He, <q>and you shall receive.</q>  Well, you <em>have</em> asked, and have received; you <em>have</em> knocked, and it has been opened to you. Only, I <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that, when you are asking, you be mindful likewise of <a href="../cathen/14520c.htm">Tertullian</a> the sinner. </p>
