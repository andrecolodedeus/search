<h1>On Baptism, Against the Donatists (Book I)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">This treatise was written about 400 A.D. Concerning it Aug. in <em>Retract</em>. Book II. c. xviii., says: I have written seven books on Baptism against the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, who strive to defend themselves by the authority of the most blessed <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian; in which I show that nothing is so effectual for the refutation of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, and for shutting their mouths directly from upholding their <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the letters and act of Cyprian.</span> </p>

<p><strong>He proves that baptism can be conferred outside the Catholic communion by heretics or schismatics, but that it ought not to be received from them; and that it is of no avail to any while in a state of heresy or schism.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. In the treatise which we wrote against the published epistle of Parmenianus  to Tichonius,  we promised that at some future time we would treat the question of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> more thoroughly;  and indeed, even if we had not made this promise, we are not unmindful that this is a debt fairly due from us to the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of our brethren. Wherefore in this treatise we have undertaken, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, not only to refute the objections which the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> have been wont to urge against us in this matter, but also to advance what God may enable us to say in respect of the authority of the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian, which they endeavor to use as a prop, to prevent their perversity from falling before the attacks of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.  And this we propose to do, in order that all whose judgment is not blinded by party spirit may understand that, so far from Cyprian's authority being in their favor, it tends directly to their refutation and discomfiture.</p>

<p>2. In the treatise above mentioned, it has already been said that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> can be conferred outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion, just as it can be also there retained. But no one of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> themselves denies that even <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a> retain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; for when they return within the pale of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and are converted through repentance,  it is never given to them a second time, and so it is ruled that it never could have been lost. So those, too, who in the sacrilege of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> depart from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, certainly retain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which they received before their departure, seeing that, in case of their return, it is not again conferred on them whence it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>, that what they had received while within the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they could not have lost in their separation. But if it can be retained outside, why may it not also be given there? If you say, "It is not rightly given without the pale;" we answer, "As it is not rightly retained, and yet is in some sense retained, so it is not indeed rightly given, but yet it is given." But as, by reconciliation to unity, that begins to be profitably possessed which was possessed to no profit in exclusion from unity, so, by the same reconciliation, that begins to be profitable which without it was given to no profit. Yet it cannot be allowed that it should be said that that was not given which was given, nor that any one should reproach a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> with not having given this, while confessing that he had given what he had himself received. For the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is what the person possesses who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and the sacrament of conferring <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is what he possesses who is ordained. And as the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> person, if he depart from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, does not thereby lose the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so also he who is ordained, if he depart from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, does not lose the sacrament of conferring <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For neither sacrament may be wronged. If a sacrament necessarily becomes void in the case of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, both must become void; if it remain valid with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, this must be so with both. If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> be acknowledged which he could not lose who severed himself from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> must also be acknowledged which was administered by one who by his secession had not lost the sacrament of conferring <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For as those who return to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if they had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before their secession, are not rebaptized, so those who return, having been ordained before their secession, are certainly not ordained again; but either they again exercise their former ministry, if the interests of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> require it, or if they do not exercise it, at any rate they retain the sacrament of their ordination; and hence it is, that when hands are laid on them,  to mark their reconciliation, they are not ranked with the <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>. For Felicianus,  when he separated himself from them with Maximianus, was not held by the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> themselves to have lost either the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or the sacrament of conferring <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For now he is a recognized member of their own body, in company with those very men whom he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> while he was separated from them in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Maximianus. And so others could receive from them, while they still had not joined our society, what they themselves had not lost by severance from our society. And hence it is clear that they are guilty of impiety who endeavor to rebaptize those who are in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity; and we act rightly who do not dare to repudiate God's <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, even when administered in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. For in all points in which they think with us, they also are in communion with us, and only are severed from us in those points in which they dissent from us. For contact and disunion are not to be measured by different <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a> in the case of material or spiritual affinities. For as union of bodies arises from continuity of position, so in the agreement of wills there is a kind of contact between <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. If, therefore, a man who has severed himself from unity wishes to do anything different from that which had been impressed on him while in the state of unity, in this point he does sever himself, and is no longer a part of the united whole; but wherever he desires to conduct himself as is customary in the state of unity, in which he himself learned and received the lessons which he seeks to follow, in these points he remains a member, and is united to the corporate whole.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>3. And so the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> in some matters are with us; in some matters have gone out from us. Accordingly, those things wherein they agree with us we do not forbid them to do; but in those things in which they differ from us, we earnestly encourage them to come and receive them from us, or return and recover them, as the case may be; and with whatever means we can, we lovingly busy ourselves, that they, freed from faults and corrected, may choose this course. We do not therefore say to them, "Abstain from giving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>," but "Abstain from giving it in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>." Nor do we say to those whom we see them on the point of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, "Do not receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>," but "Do not receive it in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>." For if any one were compelled by urgent necessity, being unable to find a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> from whom to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and so, while preserving <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peace in his heart, should receive from one without the pale of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity the sacrament which he was intending to receive within its pale, this man, should he immediately depart this life, we deem to be none other than a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. But if he should be delivered from the death of the body, on his restoring himself in bodily presence to that <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> congregation from which in heart he had never departed, so far from blaming his conduct, we should praise it with the greatest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and confidence; because he trusted that God was present to his heart, while he was striving to preserve unity, and was unwilling to depart this life without the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> to be of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not of men; wherever he might find it. But if any one who has it in his power to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> prefers, from some perversity of <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, even if he afterwards bethinks himself to come to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, because he is assured that there that sacrament will profit him, which can indeed be received but cannot profit elsewhere, beyond all question he is perverse, and guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and that the more flagrant in proportion as it was committed wilfully. For that he entertains no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the sacrament is rightly received in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by his conviction that it is there that he must look for profit even from what he has received elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>4. There are two propositions, moreover, which we affirm&mdash;that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that in it alone can it be rightly received&mdash;both of which the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> deny. Likewise there are two other propositions which we affirm&mdash;that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists among the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, but that with them it is not rightly received, of which two they strenuously confirm the former, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists with them; but they are unwilling to allow the latter, that in their Church it cannot be rightly received. Of these four propositions, three are peculiar to us; in one we both agree. For that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that it is rightly received there, and that it is not rightly received among the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, are assertions made only by ourselves; but that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists also among the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, is asserted by them and allowed by us. If any one, therefore, is desirous of being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and is already convinced that he ought to choose our Church as a medium for <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ is only profitable in it, even when it has been received elsewhere, but yet wishes to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Donatus, because not they only, nor we only, but both parties alike say that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists with them, let him pause and look to the other three points. For if he has made up his mind to follow us in the points which they deny, though he prefers what both of us acknowledge, to what only we assert, it is enough for our purpose that he prefers what they do not affirm and we alone assert, to what they alone assert. That <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we assert and they deny. That it is rightly received in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, we assert and they deny. That it is not rightly received in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Donatus, we assert and they deny. As, therefore, he is the more ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what we alone assert should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, so let him be the more ready to do what we alone declare should be done. But let him <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> more firmly, if he be so disposed, what both parties assert should be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, than what we alone maintain. For he is inclined to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> more firmly that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ exists in the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Donatus, because that is acknowledged by both of us, than that it exists in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, an assertion made alone by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. But again, he is more ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ exists also with us, as we alone assert, than that it does not exist with us, as they alone assert. For he has already determined and is fully convinced, that where we differ, our authority is to be preferred to theirs. So that he is more ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what we alone assert, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is rightly received with us, than that it is not rightly so received, since that rests only on their assertion. And, by the same rule, he is more ready to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> what we alone assert, that it is not rightly received with them, than as they alone assert, that it is rightly so received. He finds, therefore, that his confidence in being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> is somewhat profitless, seeing that, though we both acknowledge that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists with them, yet we do not both declare that it ought to be received from them. But he has made up his mind to cling rather to us in matters where we disagree. Let him therefore feel confidence in receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in our communion, where he is assured that it both exists and is rightly received; and let him not receive it in a communion, where those whose opinion he has determined to follow acknowledge indeed that it exists, but say that it cannot rightly be received. Nay, even if he should hold it to be a doubtful question, whether or no it is impossible for that to be rightly received among the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> which he is assured can rightly be received in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he would commit a grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in matters concerning the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, in the mere fact of preferring uncertainty to certainty. At any rate, he must be quite sure that a man can be rightly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, from the mere fact that he has determined to come over to it, even if he be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> elsewhere. But let him at least acknowledge it to be matter of uncertainty whether a man be not improperly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, when he finds this asserted by those whose opinion he is convinced should be preferred to theirs; and, preferring certainty to uncertainty, let him be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> here, where he has good grounds for being assured that it is rightly done, in the fact that when he thought of doing it elsewhere, he had still determined that he ought afterwards to come over to this side.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>5. Further, if any one fails to understand how it can be that we assert that the sacrament is not rightly conferred among the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, while we confess that it exists among them, let him observe that we also deny that it exists rightly among them, just as they deny that it exists rightly among those who quit their communion. Let him also consider the analogy of the military mark, which, though it can both be retained, as by deserters, and, also be received by those who are not in the army, yet ought not to be either received or retained outside its ranks; and, at the same time, it is not changed or renewed when a man is enlisted or brought back to his service. However, we must distinguish between the case of those who unwittingly join the ranks of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, under the impression that they are entering the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and those who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is no other <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> save that which, according to the promise, is spread abroad throughout the whole world, and extends even to the utmost limits of the earth; which, rising amid tares, and seeking rest in the future from the weariness of offenses, says in the Book of Psalms, "From the end of the earth I cried unto You, while my heart was in weariness: You exalted me on a rock."  But the rock was Christ, in whom the apostle says that we are now raised up, and set together in heavenly places, though not yet actually, but only in hope. <span class="stiki" id="note141152"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse6">Ephesians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> And so the psalm goes on to say, "You were my guide, because You have become my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy."  By means of His promises, which are like spears and javelins stored up in a strongly fortified place, the enemy is not only guarded against, but overthrown, as he clothes his wolves in sheep's clothing, <span class="stiki" id="note141154"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;7:15</a></span> that they may say, "Lo, here is Christ, or there;" <span class="stiki" id="note141155"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;24:23</a></span> and that they may separate many from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> city which is built upon a hill, and bring them down to the isolation of their own snares, so as utterly to destroy them. And these men, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> this, choose to receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ without the limits of the communion of the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> body, though they intend afterwards, with the sacrament which they have received elsewhere, to pass into that very communion. For they propose to receive Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in antagonism to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, well <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> that it is so even on the very day on which they receive it. And if this is a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, who is the man that will say, Grant that for a single day I may commit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? For if he proposes to pass over to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, I would fain ask why. What other answer can he give, but that it is ill to belong to the party of Donatus, and not to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Just so many days, then, as you commit this ill, of so many days' <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> are you going to be guilty. And it may be said that there is greater <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in more days' commission of it, and less in fewer; but in no wise can it be said that no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is committed at all. But what is the need of allowing this accursed wrong for a single day, or a single hour? For the man who wishes this license to be granted him, might as well ask of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or of God Himself, that for a single day he should be permitted to <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostatize</a>. For there is no reason why he should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> to be an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a> for a day, if he does not shrink from being for that time a schismatic or a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>6. I prefer, he says, to receive Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> where both parties agree that it exists. But those whom you intend to join say that it cannot be received there rightly; and those who say that it can be received there rightly are the party whom you mean to quit. What they say, therefore, whom you yourself consider of inferior authority, in opposition to what those say whom you yourself prefer, is, if not false, at any rate, to use a milder term, at least uncertain. I entreat you, therefore, to prefer what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> to what is false, or what is certain to what is uncertain. For it is not only those whom you are going to join, but you yourself who are going to join them, that confess that what you want can be rightly received in that body which you mean to join when you have received it elsewhere. For if you had any doubts whether it could be rightly received there, you would also have doubts whether you ought to make the change. If, therefore, it is doubtful whether it be not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from the party of Donatus, who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> but that it is certain <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> not to prefer receiving it where it is certain that it is not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? And those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> there through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, thinking that it is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> Church of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are guilty of less <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in comparison than these, though even they are wounded by the impiety of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; nor do they escape a grievous hurt, because others suffer even more. For when it is said to certain men, "It shall be more tolerable for the land of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in the day of judgment than for you," <span class="stiki" id="note141156"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;11:24</a></span> it is not meant that the men of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> shall escape torment, but only that the others shall be even more grievously tormented.</p>

<p>7. And yet this point had once, perhaps, been involved in obscurity and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>. But that which is a source of health to those who give heed and receive correction, is but an aggravation of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of those who, when they are no longer suffered to be <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, persist in their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to their own destruction. For the condemnation of the party of Maximianus, and their restoration after they had been condemned, together with those whom they had sacrilegiously, to use the language of their own Council,  <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, settles the whole question in dispute, and removes all controversy. There is no point at issue between ourselves and those <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> who hold communion with Primianus, which could give rise to any <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ may not only be retained, but even conferred by those who are severed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For as they themselves are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to confess that those whom Felicianus <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> received <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, inasmuch as they now acknowledge them as members of their own body, with no other <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> than that which they received in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; so we say that that is Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, even without the pale of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion, which they confer who are cut off from that communion, inasmuch as they had not lost it when they were cut off. And what they themselves think that they conferred on those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom Felicianus <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, when they admitted them to reconcilation with themselves, viz., not that they should receive that which they did not as yet possess, but that what they had received to no advantage in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and were already in possession of, should be of profit to them, this God really confers and bestows through the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion on those who come from any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> in which they received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ; viz., not that they should begin to receive the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as not possessing it before, but that what they already possessed should now begin to profit them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>8. Between us, then, and what we may call the genuine  <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> is Primianus at <a href="../cathen/03385a.htm">Carthage</a>, there is now no controversy on this point. For God willed that it should be ended by means of the followers of Maximianus, that they should be compelled by the precedent of his case to acknowledge what they would not allow at the persuasion of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity. But this brings us to consider next, whether those men do not seem to have something to say for themselves, who refuse communion with the party of Primianus, contending that in their body there remains greater sincerity of Donatism, just in proportion to the paucity of their numbers. And even if these were only the party of Maximianus, we should not be justified in despising their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. How much more, then, are we bound to consider it, when we find that this same party of Donatus is split up into many most minute fractions, all which small sections of the body blame the one much larger portion which has Primianus for its head, because they receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the followers of Maximianus; while each endeavors to maintain that it is the sole receptacle of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which exists nowhere else, neither in the whole of the world where the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> extends itself, nor in that larger main body of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, nor even in the other minute sections, but only in itself. Whereas, if all these fragments would listen not to the voice of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, but to the most unmistakable manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and would be willing to curb the fiery temper of their own perversity, they would return from their own barrenness, not indeed to the main body of Donatus, a mere fragment of which they are a smaller fragment, but to the never-failing fruitfulness of the root of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For all of them who are not against us are for us; but when they gather not with us, they scatter abroad.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>9. For, in the next place, that I may not seem to rest on mere <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> arguments&mdash;since there is so much obscurity in this question, that in earlier ages of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> of Donatus, it has caused men of great weight, and even our fathers, the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, whose hearts were full of charity, so to dispute and <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> among themselves, saving always the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that the several statutes of their Councils in their different districts long varied from each other, till at length the most wholesome opinion was established, to the removal of all doubts, by a plenary Council of the whole world: &mdash; I therefore bring forward from the gospel clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a>, by which I propose, with God's help, to prove how rightly and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> in the sight of God it has been determined, that in the case of every schismatic and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, the wound which caused his separation should be cured by the medicine of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but that what remained sound in him should rather be recognized with approbation, than wounded by condemnation. It is indeed <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that the Lord says in the gospel, "He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad." <span class="stiki" id="note141160"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> Yet when the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> had brought word to Him that they had seen one casting out devils in His name, and had forbidden him, because he followed not them, He said, "Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us. For there is no man which shall do a <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracle</a> in my name, that can lightly speak <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of me."  If, indeed, there were nothing in this man requiring correction, then any one would be safe who, setting himself outside the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, severing himself from all <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> brotherhood, should gather in Christ's name; and so there would be no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in this, "He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad." But if he required correction in the point where the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> in their <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> were anxious to check him, why did our Lord, by saying, "Forbid him not," prevent this check from being given? And how can that be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which He then says, "He that is not against you is for you?" For in this point he was not against, but for them, when he was working <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of healing in Christ's name. That both, therefore, should be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as both are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>&mdash;both the declaration, that "he that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad;" and also the injunction, "Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is for you,"&mdash; what must we understand, except that the man was to be confirmed in his veneration for that mighty Name, in respect of which he was not against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but for it; and yet he was to be blamed for separating himself from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whereby his gathering became a scattering; and if it should have so happened that he sought union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he should not have received what he already possessed, but be made to set right the points wherein he had gone astray?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>10. Nor indeed were the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the Gentile Cornelius unheard, nor did his <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> lack acceptance; nay, he was found worthy that an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> should be sent to him, and that he should behold the messenger, through whom he might assuredly have learned everything that was necessary, without requiring that any man should come to him. But since all the good that he had in his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> could not benefit him unless he were incorporated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the bond of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> brotherhood and peace, he was ordered to send to Peter, and through him learned Christ; and, being also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by his orders, he was joined by the tie of communion to the fellowship of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, to which before he was bound only by the likeness of good works. <span class="stiki" id="note141162"><a href="../bible/act010.htm">Acts&nbsp;x</a></span> And indeed it would have been most fatal to despise what he did not yet possess, vaunting himself in what he had. So too those who, by separating themselves from the society of their fellows, to the overthrow of charity, thus break the bond of unity, if they observe none of the things which they have received in that society, are separated in everything; and so any one whom they have joined to their society, if he afterwards wish to come over to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ought to receive everything which he has not already received. But if they observe some of the same things, in respect of these they have not severed themselves; and so far they are still a part of the framework of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while in all other respects they are cut off from it. Accordingly, any one whom they have associated with themselves is united to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in all those points in which they are not separated from it. And therefore, if he wish to come over to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he is made sound in those points in which he was unsound and went astray; but where he was sound in union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he is not cured, but recognized&mdash;lest in desiring to cure what is sound we should rather inflict a wound. Therefore those whom they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> they heal from the wound of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> or unbelief; but they injure them more seriously with the wound of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. For idolaters among the people of the Lord were smitten with the sword; <span class="stiki" id="note141163"><a href="../bible/exo032.htm">Exodus&nbsp;xxxii</a></span> but schismatics were swallowed up by the earth opening her mouth. <span class="stiki" id="note141164"><a href="../bible/num016.htm">Numbers&nbsp;xvi</a></span> And the apostle says, "Though I have all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." <span class="stiki" id="note141165"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:2</a></span> </p>

<p>11. If any one is brought to the surgeon, afflicted with a grievous wound in some vital part of the body, and the surgeon says that unless it is cured it must <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> death, the friends who brought him do not, I presume, act so foolishly as to count over to the surgeon all his sound limbs, and, drawing his attention to them, make answer to him, "Can it be that all these sound limbs are of no avail to save his life, and that one wounded limb is enough to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> his death?" They certainly do not say this, but they entrust him to the surgeon to be cured. Nor, again, because they so entrust him, do they ask the surgeon to cure the limbs that are sound as well; but they desire him to apply drugs with all care to the one part from which death is threatening the other sound parts too, with the certainty that it must come, unless the wound be healed. What will it then profit a man that he has sound <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or perhaps only soundness in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, when the soundness of his charity is done away with by the fatal wound of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, so that by the overthrow of it the other points, which were in themselves sound, are brought into the infection of death? To prevent which, the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through the unity of His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, does not cease striving that they may come and be healed by the medicine of reconciliation, through the bond of peace. And let them not think that they are sound because we admit that they have something sound in them; nor let them think, on the other hand, that what is sound must needs be healed, because we show that in some parts there is a wound. So that in the soundness of the sacrament, because they are not against us, they are for us; but in the wound of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, because they gather not with Christ, they scatter abroad. Let them not be exalted by what they have. Why do they pass the eyes of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> over those parts only which are sound? Let them condescend also to look humbly on their wound, and give heed not only to what they have, but also to what is wanting in them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>12. Let them see how many things, and what important things, are of no avail, if a certain single thing be wanting, and let them see what that one thing is. And herein let them hear not my words, but those of the apostle: "Though I speak with the tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and have not charity, I have become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>13. But they think within themselves that they show very great subtlety in asking whether the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ in the party of Donatus makes men sons or not; so that, if we allow that it does make them sons, they may assert that theirs is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the mother which could give birth to sons in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ; and since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> must be one, they may allege that ours is no Church. But if we say that it does not make them sons, "Why then," say they, "do you not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> those who pass from us to you to be born again in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, after they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with us, if they are not thereby born as yet?"</p>

<p>14. Just as though their party gained the power of generation in virtue of what constitutes its division, and not from what causes its union with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For it is severed from the bond of peace and charity, but it is joined in one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And so there is one Church which alone is called <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; and whenever it has anything of its own in these communions of different bodies which are separate from itself, it is most certainly in virtue of this which is its own in each of them that it, not they, has the power of generation. For neither is it their separation that generates, but what they have retained of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and if they were to go on to abandon this, they would lose the power of generation. The generation, then, in each case proceeds from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, whose <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are retained, from which any such birth can alone in any case proceed&mdash;although not all who receive its birth belong to its unity, which shall save those who persevere even to the end. Nor is it those only that do not belong to it who are openly guilty of the manifest sacrilege of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, but also those who, being outwardly joined to its unity, are yet separated by a life of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had herself given birth to <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> through the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and yet it was declared to him that he had no part in the inheritance of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.  Did he lack anything in respect of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, of the gospel, of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>? But in that he wanted charity, he was born in vain; and perhaps it had been well for him that he had never been born at all. Was anything wanting to their birth to whom the apostle says, "I have fed you with milk, and not with meat, even as babes in Christ"? Yet he recalls them from the sacrilege of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, into which they were rushing, because they were carnal: "I have fed you," he says, "with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able. For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying and strife, are you not carnal, and walk as men? For while one says, I am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>; and another, I am of Apollos; are you not men?" <span class="stiki" id="note141173"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1-4</a></span> For of these he says above: "Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and in the same judgment. For it has been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chl&ouml;e, that there are contentions among you. Now this I say, that every one of you says, I am of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Is Christ divided? Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> crucified for you? Or were ye <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note141174"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:10-13</a></span> These, therefore, if they continued in the same perverse obstinacy, were doubtless indeed born, but yet would not belong by the bond of peace and unity to the very Church in respect of which they were born. Therefore she herself bears them in her own womb and in the womb of her handmaids, by virtue of the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, as though by virtue of the seed of her husband. For it is not without meaning that the apostle says that all these things were done by way of figure.  But those who are too <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a>, and are not joined to their lawful mother, are like Ishmael, of whom it is said, "Cast out this bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and her Son: for the son of the bond-<a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac." <span class="stiki" id="note141176"><a href="../bible/gen021.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;21:10</a></span> But those who peacefully <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the lawful wife of their father, whose sons they are by lawful descent, are like the sons of Jacob, born indeed of handmaids, but yet receiving the same inheritance. <span class="stiki" id="note141177"><a href="../bible/gen030.htm#verse3">Genesis&nbsp;30:3</a></span> But those who are born within the <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>, of the womb of the mother herself, and then neglect the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> they have received, are like Isaac's son <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, who was rejected, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself bearing <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to it, and saying, "I loved Jacob, and I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>;"  and that though they were twin-brethren, the offspring of the same womb.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>15. They ask also, "Whether <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the party of Donatus:" so that, if we say that they are remitted, they may answer, then the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is there; for when by the breathing of our Lord the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> was given to the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, He then went on to say, "Baptize all nations in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141179"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> Whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they are retained." <span class="stiki" id="note141180"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;20:23</a></span> And if it is so, they say, then our communion is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>; for the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> does not work the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> except in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And if our communion is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then your communion is not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For that is one, wherever it is, of which it is said, "My dove is but one; she is the only one of her mother;" <span class="stiki" id="note141181"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:9</a></span> nor can there be just so many churches as there are schisms. But if we should say that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not there remitted, then, say they, there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> there; and therefore ought you to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those whom you receive from us. And since you do not do this, you confess that you are not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>16. To these we reply, following the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, by asking them to answer themselves what they ask of us. For I beg them to tell us whether there is any remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> where there is not charity; for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are the darkness of the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>. For we find St. John saying, "He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is still in darkness." <span class="stiki" id="note141182"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:11</a></span> But none would create schisms, if they were not blinded by <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of their brethren. If, therefore, we say that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not remitted there, how is he regenerate who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among them? And what is regeneration in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, except the being renovated from the corruption of the old man? And how can he be so renovated whose past <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are not remitted? But if he be not regenerate, neither does he put on Christ; from which it seems to follow that he ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again. For the apostle says, "For as many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ have put on Christ;" <span class="stiki" id="note141183"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians&nbsp;3:27</a></span> and if he has not so put on Christ, neither should he be considered to have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Further, since we say that he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, we confess that he has put on Christ; and if we confess this, we confess that he is regenerate. And if this be so, how does St. John say, "He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother remains still in darkness," if remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> has already taken place? Can it be that <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> does not involve <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of one's brethren? Who will maintain this, when both the origin of, and perseverance in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> consists in nothing else save <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of the brethren?</p>

<p>17. They think that they solve this question when they say: "There is then no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and therefore no creation of the new man by regeneration, and accordingly neither is there the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But since we confess that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ exists in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, we propose this question to them for solution: Was <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> endued with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ? They will answer, Yes; being compelled to do so by the authority of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture. I ask them whether they confess that he received remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. They will certainly acknowledge it. So I ask why Peter said to him that he had no part in the lot of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. Because, they say, he <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> afterwards, wishing to buy with money the gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> were able to sell.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>18. What if he approached <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself in deceit? Were his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remitted, or were they not? Let them choose which they will. Whichever they choose will answer our purpose. If they say they were remitted, how then shall "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of discipline flee deceit," <span class="stiki" id="note141184"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom&nbsp;1:5</a></span> if in him who was full of deceit He worked remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? If they say they were not remitted, I ask whether, if he should afterwards confess his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> with contrition of heart and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sorrow, it would be judged that he ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again. And if it is mere <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> to assert this, then let them confess that a man can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and that yet his heart, persisting in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> or sacrilege, may not allow remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> to be given; and so let them understand that men may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in communions severed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in which Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is given and received in the said celebration of the sacrament, but that it will only then be of avail for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when the recipient, being reconciled to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is purged from the sacrilege of deceit, by which his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were retained, and their remission prevented. For, as in the case of him who had approached the sacrament in deceit there is no second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but he is purged by faithful discipline and truthful confession, which he could not be without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so that what was given before becomes then powerful to work his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, when the former deceit is done away by the truthful confession; so also in the case of the man who, while an enemy to the peace and <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, received in any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which the schismatics in question had not lost from among them, though by his sacrilege his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were not remitted, yet, when he corrects his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and comes over to the communion and unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he ought not to be again <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>: because by his very reconciliation to the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> he receives this benefit, that the sacrament now begins in unity to be of avail for the remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which could not so avail him as received in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>.</p>

<p>19. But if they should say that in the man who has approached the sacrament in deceit, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are indeed removed by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> power of so great a sacrament at the moment when he received it, but return immediately in consequence of his deceit: so that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> has both been present with him at his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for the removal of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and has also fled before his perseverance in deceit so that they should return: so that both declarations prove <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>&mdash;both, "As many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ have put on Christ;" and also, "The <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> spirit of discipline will flee deceit;"&mdash; that is to say, that both the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> clothes him with Christ, and the sinfulness of deceit strips him of Christ; like the case of a man who passes from darkness through light into darkness again, his eyes being always directed towards darkness, though the light cannot but penetrate them as he passes&mdash;if they should say this, let them understand that this is also the case with those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without the pale of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but yet with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in itself, wherever it may be; and which therefore belongs not to those who separate themselves, but to the body from which they are separated; while yet it avails even among them so far, that they pass through its light back to their own darkness, their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which in that moment had been dispelled by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, returning immediately upon them, as though it were the darkness returning which the light had dispelled while they were passing through it.</p>

<p>20. For that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which have been remitted do return upon a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, where there is no brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, is most clearly taught by <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord</a>, in the case of the servant whom He found owing Him ten thousand talents, and to whom He yet forgave all at his entreaty. But when he refused to have pity on his fellow-servant who owed him a hundred pence, the Lord commanded him to pay what He had forgiven him. The time, then, at which pardon is received through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is as it were the time for rendering accounts, so that all the debts which are found to be due may be remitted. Yet it was not afterwards that the servant lent his fellow-servant the money, which he had so pitilessly exacted when the other was unable to pay it; but his fellow-servant already owed him the debt, when he himself, on rendering his accounts to his master, was excused a debt of so vast an amount. He had not first excused his fellow-servant, and so come to receive forgiveness from his Lord. This is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the words of the fellow-servant: "Have patience with me, and I will pay you all." Otherwise he would have said, "You forgave me it before; why do you again demand it?" This is made more clear by the words of the Lord Himself. For He says, "But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellow-servants which was owing  him a hundred pence." <span class="stiki" id="note141186"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;18:23-35</a></span> He does not say, "To whom he had already forgiven a debt of a hundred pence." Since then He says, "was owing him," it is clear that he had not forgiven him the debt. And indeed it would have been better, and more in accordance with the position of a man who was going to render an account of so great a debt, and expected forbearance from his lord, that he should first have forgiven his fellow-servant what was due to him, and so have come to render the account when there was such need for imploring the compassion of his lord. Yet the fact that he had not yet forgiven his fellow-servant, did not prevent his lord from forgiving him all his debts on the occasion of receiving his accounts. But what advantage was it to him, since they all immediately returned with redoubled force upon his head, in consequence of his persistent want of charity? So the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not prevented from giving remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, even if he to whom they are forgiven continues to cherish <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards his brother in his heart. For the guilt of yesterday is remitted, and all that was before it, nay, even the guilt of the very hour and moment previous to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and during <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself. But then he immediately begins again to be responsible, not only for the days, hours, moments which ensue, but also for the past&mdash;the guilt of all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which were remitted returning on him, as happens only too frequently in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>21. For it often happens that a man has an enemy whom he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> most <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjustly</a>; although we are commanded to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> even our <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a> enemies, and to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for them. But in some sudden danger of death he begins to be uneasy, and desires <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which he receives in such haste, that the emergency scarcely admits of the necessary formal examination of a few words, much less of a long conversation, so that this <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> should be driven from his heart, even supposing it to be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to the minister who baptizes him. Certainly cases of this sort are still found to occur not only with us, but also with them. What shall we say then? Are this man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven or not? Let them choose just which alternative they prefer. For if they are forgiven, they immediately return: this is the teaching of the gospel, the authoritative announcement of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Whether, therefore, they are forgiven or not, medicine is necessary afterwards; and yet if the man lives, and learns that his fault stands in need of correction, and corrects it, he is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anew, either with them or with us. So in the points in which schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> neither entertain different opinions nor observe different practice from ourselves, we do not correct them when they join us, but rather commend what we find in them. For where they do not differ from us, they are not separated from us. But because these things do them no good so long as they are schismatics or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, on account of other points in which they differ from us, not to mention the most grievous <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that is involved in separation itself, therefore, whether their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> remain in them, or return again immediately after remission, in either case we exhort them to come to the soundness of peace and <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity, not only that they may obtain something which they had not before, but also that what they had may begin to be of use to them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>22. It is to no purpose, then, that they say to us, "If you acknowledge our <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, what do we lack that should make you suppose that we ought to think seriously of joining your communion?" For we reply, We do not acknowledge any <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of yours; for it is not the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of schismatics or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, wheresoever it may be found, and wherever it may be transferred. But it is in no sense yours, except because you entertain false opinions, and do <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> acts, and have impiously separated yourselves from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For if everything else in your practice and opinions were <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, and still you were to persist in this same separation, contrary to the bond of brotherly peace, contrary to the union of all the brethren, who have been manifest, according to the promise, in all the world; the particulars of whose history, and the secrets of whose hearts, you never could have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> or considered in every case, so as to have a right to condemn them; who, moreover, cannot be liable to condemnation for submitting themselves to the judges of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> rather than to one of the parties to the dispute&mdash;in this one thing, at least, in such a case, you are deficient, in which he is deficient who lacks charity. Why should we go over our argument again? Look and see yourselves in the apostle, how much there is that you lack. For what does it matter to him who lacks charity, whether he be carried away outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at once by some blast of <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>, or remain within the Lord's harvest, so as to be separated only at the final winnowing? And yet even such, if they have once been born in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, need not be born again.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p>23. For it is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that gives birth to all, either within her pale, of her own womb; or beyond it, of the seed of her bridegroom&mdash;(either of herself, or of her handmaid. ) But <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, even though born of the lawful wife, was separated from the people of God because he quarrelled with his brother. And Asher, born indeed by the authority of a wife, but yet of a handmaid, was admitted to the land of promise on account of his brotherly good-will. Whence also it was not the being born of a handmaid, but his quarrelling with his brother, that stood in the way of Ishmael, to <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> his separation from the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and he received no benefit from the power of the wife, whose son he rather was, inasmuch as it was in virtue of her conjugal rights that he was both conceived in and born of the womb of the handmaid. Just as with the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> it is by the right of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which exists in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that whosoever is born receives his birth; but if they agree with their brethren, through the unity of peace they come to the land of promise, not to be again cast out from the bosom of their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> mother, but to be acknowledged in the seed of their father; but if they persevere in discord, they will belong to the line of Ishmael. For Ishmael was first, and then Isaac; and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> was the elder, Jacob the younger. Not that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> gives birth before the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself gives birth first to those who are carnal or animal, and afterwards to those who are spiritual; but because, in the actual lot of our mortality, in which we are born of the seed of Adam, "that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual." <span class="stiki" id="note141188"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse46">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:46</a></span> But from mere animal sensation, because "the natural man receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141189"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> arise all dissensions and schisms. And the apostle says <span class="stiki" id="note141190"><a href="../bible/gal004.htm">Galatians&nbsp;iv</a></span> that all who persevere in this animal sensation belong to the old covenant. that is, to the desire of earthly promises, which are indeed the type of the spiritual; but "the natural man receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141191"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> </p>

<p>24. At whatever time, therefore, men have begun to be of such a nature in this life, that, although they have partaken of such divine <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> as were appointed for the dispensation under which they lived, they yet savor of carnal things, and hope for and desire carnal things from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether in this life or afterwards, they are yet carnal. But the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, is an ancient institution even in the pilgrimage of this life, having a carnal interest in some men, a spiritual interest in others. To the carnal belongs the old covenant, to the spiritual the new. But in the first days both were hidden, from <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> even to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>. But by <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> the old covenant was made manifest, and in it was hidden the new covenant, because after a secret fashion it was typified. But so soon as the Lord came in the flesh, the new covenant was revealed; yet, though the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the old covenant passed away; the dispositions peculiar to it did not pass away. For they still exist in those whom the apostle declares to be already born indeed by the sacrament of the new covenant, but yet capable, as being natural, of receiving the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>. For, as in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the old covenant some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were already spiritual, belonging secretly to the new covenant, which was then concealed, so now also in the sacrament of the new covenant, which has been by this time revealed, many live who are natural. And if they will not advance to receive the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, to which the discourse of the apostle urges them, they will still belong to the old covenant. But if they advance, even before they receive them, yet by their very advance and approach they belong to the new covenant; and if, before becoming spiritual, they are snatched away from this life, yet through the protection of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the sacrament they are reckoned in the land of the living, where the Lord is our hope and our portion. Nor can I find any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> interpretation of the scripture, "Your eyes saw my substance, yet being imperfect"  considering what follows, "And in Your book shall all be written." </p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>25. But the same mother which brought forth Abel, and <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, and <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, and <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, brought forth also <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> who succeeded him till the coming of our Lord; and the mother which gave birth to them gave birth also to our <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, and all good <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. For all these that have appeared have been born indeed at different times, but are included in the society of our people; and it is as citizens of the same state that they have experienced the labors of this pilgrimage, and some of them are experiencing them, and others will experience them even to the end. Again, the mother who brought forth Cain, and Ham, and Ishmael, and <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>, brought forth also Dathan and others like him in the same people; and she who gave birth to them gave birth also to Judas the false apostle, and <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, and all the other false <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> who up to this time have persisted obstinately in their carnal affections, whether they have been mingled in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or separated from it in open <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. But when men of this kind have the gospel preached to them, and receive the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> at the hand of those who are spiritual, it is as though Rebecca gave birth to them of her own womb, as she did to <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a>; but when they are produced in the midst of the people of God through the instrumentality of those who preach the gospel not sincerely,  Sarah is indeed the mother, but through Hagar. So when good spiritual <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are produced by the preaching or <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of those who are carnal, Leah, indeed, or Rachel, gives birth to them in her right as wife, but from the womb of a handmaid. But when good and faithful <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> are born of those who are spiritual in the gospel, and either attain to the development of spiritual age, or do not cease to strive in that direction, or are only deterred from doing so by want of power, these are born like Isaac from the womb of Sarah, or Jacob from the womb of Rebecca, in the new life and the new covenant.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p>26. Therefore, whether they seem to abide within, or are openly outside, whatsoever is flesh is flesh, and what is chaff is chaff, whether they persevere in remaining in their barrenness on the threshing-floor, or, when <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> befalls them, are carried out as it were by the blast of some wind. And even that man is always severed from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is without spot or wrinkle,  who associates with the congregation of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> in carnal obstinacy. Yet we ought to despair of no man, whether he be one who shows himself to be of this nature within the pale of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or whether he more openly opposes it from without. But the spiritual, or those who are steadily advancing with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> exertion towards this end, do not stray without the pale; since even when, by some perversity or necessity among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, they seem to be driven forth, they are more approved than if they had remained within, since they are in no degree roused to contend against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but remain rooted in the strongest foundation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity on the solid rock of unity. For hereunto belongs what is said in the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>: "But the birds divided he not." <span class="stiki" id="note141196"><a href="../bible/gen015.htm#verse10">Genesis&nbsp;15:10</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 18.</h2>

<p>27. On the question of baptism,  then, I think that I have argued at sufficient length; and since this is a most manifest <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> which is called by the name of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, it only remains that on the subject of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> what the universal Church maintains, apart from the sacrilege of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. And yet, if within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> different men still held different opinions on the point, without meanwhile violating peace, then till some one clear and simple decree should have been passed by an universal Council, it would have been right for the charity which seeks for unity to throw a veil over the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, as it is written "For charity shall cover the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141197"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> For, seeing that its absence causes the presence of all other things to be of no avail, we may well suppose that in its presence there is found pardon for the absence of some missing things.</p>

<p>28. There are great <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> of this existing on the part of the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian, in his letters&mdash;to come at last to him of whose authority they carnally flatter themselves they are possessed, while by his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> they are spiritually overthrown. For at that time, before the consent of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had declared authoritatively, by the decree of a plenary Council,  what practice should be followed in this matter, it seemed to him, in common with about eighty of his fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of the African churches, that every man who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should, on joining the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anew. And I take it, that the reason why the Lord did not reveal the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> in this to a man of such eminence, was, that his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> humility and charity in guarding the peace and health of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> might be made manifest, and might be noticed, so as to serve as an example of healing power, so to speak, not only to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> of that age, but also to those who should come after. For when a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of so important a Church, himself a man of so great merit and <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, endowed with such excellence of heart and power of eloquence, entertained an opinion about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> different from that which was to be confirmed by a more diligent searching into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; though many of his colleagues held what was not yet made manifest by authority, but was sanctioned by the past custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and afterwards embraced by the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world; yet under these circumstances he did not sever himself, by refusal of communion, from the others who thought differently, and indeed never ceased to urge on the others that they should "forbear one another in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." <span class="stiki" id="note141199"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;4:2-3</a></span> For so, while the framework of the body remained whole, if any infirmity occurred in certain of its members, it might rather regain its health from their general soundness, than be deprived of the chance of any healing care by their death in severance from the body. And if he had severed himself, how many were there to follow! What a name was he likely to make for himself among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>! How much more widely would the name of Cyprianist have spread than that of <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a>! But he was not a son of perdition, one of those of whom it is said, "You cast them down while they were elevated;"  but he was the son of the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who in the clear illumination of his mind failed to see one thing, only that through him another thing might be more excellently seen. "And yet," says the apostle, "show I unto you a more excellent way: though I speak with the tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, and have not charity, I have become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."  He had therefore imperfect insight into the hidden <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of the sacrament. But if he had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> of all <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, without having charity, it would have been nothing. But as he, with imperfect insight into the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, was careful to preserve charity with all <a href="../cathen/06147a.htm">courage</a> and humility and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he deserved to come to the crown of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>; so that, if any cloud had crept over the clearness of his <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> from his infirmity as man, it might be dispelled by the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> brightness of his blood. For it was not in vain that <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, when He declared Himself to be the vine, and His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, as it were, the branches in the vine, gave command that those which bare no fruit should be cut off, and removed from the vine as useless branches. <span class="stiki" id="note141202"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;15:1-2</a></span> But what is really fruit, save that new offspring, of which He further says, "A new commandment I give unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another?" <span class="stiki" id="note141203"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34</a></span> This is that very charity, without which the rest profits nothing. The apostle also says: "But the fruit of the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, meekness, <a href="../cathen/14481a.htm">temperance</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note141204"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse22">Galatians&nbsp;5:22-23</a></span> which all begin with charity, and with the rest of the combination forms one unity in a kind of wondrous cluster.  Nor is it again in vain that our Lord added, "And every branch that bears fruit, my Father purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit," <span class="stiki" id="note141206"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;15:2</a></span> but because those who are strong in the fruit of charity may yet have something which requires purging, which the Husbandman will not leave untended. Whilst then, that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man entertained on the subject of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> an opinion at variance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> view, which was afterwards thoroughly examined and confirmed after most diligent consideration, his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was compensated by his remaining in catholic unity, and by the abundance of his charity; and finally it was cleared away by the pruning-hook of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p>29. But that I may not seem to be uttering these praises of the blessed <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> (which, indeed, are not his, but rather those of Him by whose <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> he showed himself what he was), in order to escape the burden of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a>, let us now bring forward from his letters the testimony by which the mouths of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> may most of all be stopped. For they advance his authority before the unlearned, to show that in a manner they do well when they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> afresh the <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">faithful</a> who come to them. Too wretched are they&mdash; and, unless they correct themselves, even by themselves are they utterly condemned&mdash; who choose in the example set them by so great a man to imitate just that fault, which only did not injure him, because he walked with constant steps even to the end in that from which they have strayed who "have not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> the way of peace."  It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>; and although it may exist among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics, yet it does not belong to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; and therefore even those who come from thence to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself ought not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh. Yet to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> on this point is one thing; it is another thing that those who are straying from the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and have fallen headlong into the pit of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, should go on to decide that any who join them ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again. For the former is a speck on the brightness of a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> which abundance of charity  would fain have covered; the latter is a stain in their nether foulness which the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of peace in their countenance ostentatiously brings to light. But the subject for our further consideration, relating to the authority of the blessed Cyprian, we will commence from a fresh beginning.</p>
