<h1>On Baptism, Against the Donatists (Book III)</h1>

<p><strong>Augustine undertakes the refutation of the arguments which might be derived from the epistle of Cyprian to Jubaianus, to give color to the view that the baptism of Christ could not be conferred by heretics.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. I think that it may now be considered clear to every one, that the authority of the blessed Cyprian for the maintenance of the bond of peace, and the avoiding of any violation of that most wholesome charity which preserves unity in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, may be urged on our side rather than on the side of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>. For if they have chosen to act upon his example in rebaptizing <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, because he thought that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on joining the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, shall not we rather follow his example, whereby he laid down a manifest rule that one ought in no wise, by the establishment of a separate communion, to secede from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion, that is, from the body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> dispersed throughout the world, even on the admission of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> men, since he was unwilling even to remove from the right of communion those whom he considered to have received <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> men without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion, saying, "Judging no one, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he differ from us?" </p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>2. Nevertheless, I see what may still be required of me, viz., that I should answer those plausible arguments, by which, in even earlier times, <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, or Cyprian himself, or those in Africa who agreed with them, or any others in far distant lands beyond the sea, were moved, not indeed by the authority of any plenary or even regionary Council, but by a mere epistolary correspondence, to think that they ought to adopt a custom which had no sanction from the ancient custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and which was expressly forbidden by the most unanimous resolution of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> world in order that an <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which had begun to creep into the minds of some men, through discussions of this kind, might be cured by the more powerful <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and universal healing power of unity coming on the side of safety. And so they may see with what security I approach this discourse. If I am unable to gain my point, and show how those arguments may be refuted which they bring forward from the Council and the epistles of Cyprian, to the effect that Christ's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> may not be given by the hands of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, I shall still remain safely in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in whose communion Cyprian himself remained with those who differed from him.</p>

<p>3. But if they say that the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> then, because there were a few, or, if they prefer it, even a considerable number, who denied the validity of any <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> conferred in an <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> body, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> all who came from thence, what then? Did the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not exist at all before <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, with whom that new kind of system began, at variance with all previous custom? Or how, again after the time of <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, when, unless there had been a return to the primitive custom, there would have been no need for Cyprian to set on foot another Council? Was there no Church then, because such a custom as this prevailed everywhere, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ should be considered nothing but the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even though it were <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to have been conferred in a body of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics? But if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> even then, and had not perished through a breach of its continuity, but was, on the contrary, holding its ground, and receiving increase in every nation, surely it is the safest plan to abide by this same custom, which then embraced good and bad alike in unity. But if there was then no Church in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, because <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were received without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and this prevailed by universal custom, whence has Donatus made his appearance? From what land did he spring? Or from what sea did he emerge? Or from what sky did he fall? And so we, as I had begun to say, are safe in the communion of that Church, throughout the whole extent of which the custom now prevails, which prevailed in like manner through its whole extent before the time of <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, and in the interval between <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a> and Cyprian, and whose unity neither <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a> nor Cyprian ever deserted, nor those who agreed with them, although they entertained different views from the rest of their brethren&mdash; all of them remaining in the same communion of unity with the very men from whom they differed in opinion. But let the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> themselves consider what their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> position is, if they neither can say whence they derived their origin, if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had already been destroyed by the plague-spot of communion with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics received into her bosom without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; nor again agree with Cyprian himself, for he declared that he remained in communion with those who received <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, and so also with those who were received as well: while they have separated themselves from the communion of the whole world, on account of the charge of having delivered up the sacred books, which they brought against the men whom they maligned in Africa, but failed to convict when brought to trial beyond the sea; although, even had the crimes which they alleged been <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, they were much less heinous than the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; and yet these could not defile Cyprian in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of those who came from them without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as he conceived, and were admitted without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion. Nor, in the very point in which they say that they imitate Cyprian, can they find any answer to make about acknowledging the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the followers of Maximianus, together with those whom, though they belonged to the party that they had first condemned in their own plenary Council, and then gone on to prosecute even at the tribunal of the secular power, they yet received back into their communion, in the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> of the very same <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> under whom they had been condemned. Wherefore, if the communion of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men destroyed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the time of Cyprian, they have no source from which they can derive their own communion; and if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was not destroyed, they have no excuse for their separation from it. Moreover, they are neither following the example of Cyprian, since they have burst the bond of unity, nor abiding by their own Council, since they have recognized the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the followers of Maximianus.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>4. Let us therefore, seeing that we adhere to the example of Cyprian, go on now to consider Cyprian's Council. What says Cyprian? "You have heard," he says, "most beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> has written to me, consulting my moderate ability concerning the unlawful and profane <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and what answer I gave him&mdash;giving a judgment which we have once and again and often given, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and sanctified with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Another letter of Jubaianus has likewise been read to you, in which, agreeably to his sincere and religious devotion, in answer to our epistle, he not only expressed his assent, but returned thanks also, acknowledging that he had received instruction."  In these words of the blessed Cyprian, we find that he had been consulted by Jubaianus, and what answer he had given to his questions, and how Jubaianus acknowledged with gratitude that he had received instruction. Ought we then to be thought unreasonably persistent if we desire to consider this same epistle by which Jubaianus was convinced? For till such time as we are also convinced (if there are any arguments of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whereby this can be done), Cyprian himself has established our security by the right of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> communion.</p>

<p>5. For he goes on to say: "It remains that we severally declare our opinion on this same subject, judging no one, nor depriving any one of the right of communion if he differ from us."  He allows me, therefore, without losing the right of communion, not only to continue inquiring into the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but even to hold opinions differing from his own. "For no one of us," he says, "sets himself up as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or by tyrannical terror forces his colleagues to a necessity of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a>." What could be more kind? What more <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a>? Surely there is here no authority restraining us from inquiry into what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. "Inasmuch as every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>," he says, "in the free use of his liberty and power, has the right of forming his own judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he can himself judge another,"&mdash; that is, I suppose, in those questions which have not yet been brought to perfect clearness of solution; for he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> what a deep question about the sacrament was then occupying the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with every kind of disputation, and gave free liberty of inquiry to every man, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> might be made <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> by investigation. For he was surely not uttering what was false, and trying to catch his simpler colleagues in their speech, so that, when they should have betrayed that they held opinions at variance with his, he might then propose, in violation of his promise, that they should be <a href="../cathen/05678a.htm">excommunicated</a>. Far be it from a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> to entertain such accursed treachery; indeed, they who hold such a view about such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, thinking that it conduces to his praise, do but show that it would be in accordance with their own nature. I for my part will in no wise <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that Cyprian, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a>, whose greatness only made him proportionately <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> in all things, so as to find favor before the Lord, <span class="stiki" id="note141267"><a href="../bible/sir003.htm#verse18">Sirach&nbsp;3:18</a></span> should ever, especially in the sacred Council of his colleagues, have uttered with his mouth what was not echoed in his heart, especially as he further adds, "But we must all await the judgment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who alone has the power both of setting us in the government of His Church, and of judging of our acts therein."  When, then, he called to their remembrance so solemn a judgment, hoping to hear the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from his colleagues, would he first set them the example of lying? May God avert such <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a> from every <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man, and how much more from Cyprian! We have therefore the free liberty of inquiry granted to us by the most moderate and most truthful speech of Cyprian.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>6. Next his colleagues proceed to deliver their several opinions. But first they listened to the letter written to Jubaianus; for it was read, as was mentioned in the preamble. Let it therefore be read among ourselves also, that we too, with the help of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, may discover from it what we ought to think. "What!" I think I hear some one saying, "do you proceed to tell us what Cyprian wrote to Jubaianus?" I have read the letter, I confess, and should certainly have been a <a href="../cathen/04347a.htm">convert</a> to his views, had I not been induced to consider the matter more carefully by the vast weight of authority, originating in those whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, distributed throughout the world amid so many nations, of Latins, Greeks, barbarians, not to mention the Jewish race itself, has been able to produce&mdash;that same Church which gave birth to Cyprian himself&mdash;men whom I could in no wise bring myself to think had been unwilling without reason to hold this view&mdash;not because it was impossible that in so difficult a question the opinion of one or of a few might not have been more near the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> than that of more, but because one must not lightly, without full consideration and investigation of the matter to the best of his abilities, decide in favor of a single individual, or even of a few, against the decision of so very many men of the same religion and communion, all endowed with great talent and abundant learning. And so how much was suggested to me on more diligent inquiry, even by the letter of Cyprian himself, in favor of the view which is now held by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ is to be recognized and approved, not by the standard of their merits by whom it is administered, but by His alone of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizes," <span class="stiki" id="note141269"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> will be shown naturally in the course of our argument. Let us therefore suppose that the letter which was written by Cyprian to Jubaianus has been read among us, as it was read in the Council.  And I would have every one read it who means to read what I am going to say, lest he might possibly think that I have suppressed some things of consequence. For it would take too much time, and be irrelevant to the elucidation of the matter in hand, were we at this moment to quote all the words of this epistle.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>7. But if any one should ask what I hold in the meantime, while discussing this question, I answer that, in the first place, the letter of Cyprian suggested to me what I should hold till I should see clearly the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the question which next begins to be discussed. For Cyprian himself says: "But some will say, 'What then will become of those who in times past, coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, were admitted without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>?'"  Whether they were really without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or whether they were admitted because those who admitted them conceived that they had partaken of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, is a matter for our future consideration. At any rate, Cyprian himself shows plainly enough what was the ordinary custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when he says that in past time those who came to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> were admitted without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<p>8. For in the Council itself Castus of Sicca says: "He who, despising <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, presumes to follow custom, is either <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> or evil-disposed towards the brethren to whom the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is revealed, or is ungrateful towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by whose inspiration His Church is instructed."  Whether the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had been revealed, we shall investigate hereafter; at any rate, he acknowledges that the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> was different.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>9. Libosus also of Vaga says: "The Lord says in the gospel, 'I am the Truth.' <span class="stiki" id="note141273"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> He does not say, 'I am custom.' Therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is made manifest, custom must give way to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."  Clearly, no one could <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that custom must give way to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> where it is made manifest. But we shall see presently about the manifestation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. Meanwhile he also makes it clear that custom was on the other side.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>10. Zosimus also of Tharassa said: "When a revelation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been made, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> must give way to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for even Peter, who at the first <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, afterwards gave way to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when he declared the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>."  He indeed chose to say <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, not custom; but in saying "for even Peter, who at the first <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, afterwards gave way to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when he declared the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>," he shows plainly enough that there was a custom also on the subject of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> at variance with his views. At the same time, also, he warns us that it was not impossible that Cyprian might have held an opinion about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> at variance with that required by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, as held by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> both before and after him, if even Peter could hold a view at variance with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as taught us by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note141276"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse11">Galatians&nbsp;2:11-14</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>11. Likewise Felix of Buslacene said: "In admitting <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let no one prefer custom to reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; because reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> always prevail to the exclusion of custom."  Nothing could be better, if it be reason, and if it be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; but this we shall see presently. Meanwhile, it is clear from the words of this man also that the custom was the other way.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>12. Likewise Honoratus of Tucca  said: "Since Christ is the Truth, we ought to follow <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> rather than custom."  By all these declarations it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that we are not excluded from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, till it shall have been clearly shown what is the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which they say must be preferred to our custom. But if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has made it clear that the very regulation ought to be maintained which the said custom had prescribed, then it is evident both that this custom was not established or confirmed in vain, and also that, in consequence of the discussions in question, the most wholesome observance of so great a sacrament, which could never, indeed, have been changed in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, was even more watchfully guarded with the most scrupulous caution, when it had received the further corroboration of Councils.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>13. Therefore Cyprian writes to Jubaianus as follows, "concerning the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who, being placed without, and set down out of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>," seem to him to "claim to themselves a matter over which they have neither right nor power. Which we," he says, "cannot account valid or lawful, since it is clear that among them it is unlawful."  Neither, indeed, do we deny that a man who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or in any <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, derives no profit from it so far as he is partner in the perverseness of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics; nor do we hold that those who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, although they confer the real <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, are yet acting rightly, in gathering adherents outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and entertaining opinions contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But it is one thing to be without a sacrament, another thing to be in possession of it wrongly, and to usurp it unlawfully. Therefore they do not cease to be <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, merely because they are unlawfully used, not only by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but by all kinds of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and impious <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. These, indeed, ought to be corrected and punished, but the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> should be acknowledged and revered.</p>

<p>14. Cyprian, indeed, says that on this subject not one, but two or more Councils were held; always, however, in Africa. For indeed in one he mentions that seventy-one <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> had been assembled, &mdash; to all whose authority we do not hesitate, with all due deference to Cyprian, to prefer the authority, supported by many more <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> spread throughout the whole world, of which Cyprian himself rejoiced that he was an inseparable member.</p>

<p>15. Nor is the water "profane and adulterous"  over which the name of God is invoked, even though it be invoked by profane and adulterous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>; because neither the creature itself of water, nor the name invoked, is adulterous. But the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> by the words of the gospel, is necessarily <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, however polluted and unclean its ministers may be; because its inherent <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> cannot be polluted, and the divine excellence abides in its sacrament, whether to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of those who use it aright, or to the destruction of those who use it wrong. Would you indeed maintain that, while the light of the sun or of a candle, diffused through unclean places, contracts no foulness in itself therefrom, yet the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ can be defiled by the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of any man, whatsoever he may be? For if we turn our thoughts to the visible materials themselves, which are to us the medium of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, every one must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that they admit of corruption. But if we think on that which they convey to us, who can fail to see that it is incorruptible, however much the men through whose ministry it is conveyed are either being rewarded or punished for the character of their lives?</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>16. But Cyprian was right in not being moved by what Jubaianus wrote, that "the followers of <a href="../cathen/11138a.htm">Novatian</a>  rebaptize those who come to them from the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."  For, in the first place, it does not follow that whatever <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have done in a perverse spirit of mimicry, <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are therefore to abstain from doing, because the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> do the same. And again, the reasons are different for which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought respectively to abstain from rebaptizing. For it would not be right for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to do so, even if it were fitting in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; because their argument is, that among the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> is wanting that which they themselves received while still within the pale, and took away with them when they departed. Whereas the reason why the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should not administer again the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which was given among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, is that it may not seem to decide that a power which is Christ's alone belongs to its members, or to pronounce that to be wanting in the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> which they have received within her pale, and certainly could not lose by straying outside. For thus much Cyprian himself, with all the rest, established, that if any should return from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they should be received back, not by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but by the discipline of penitence; whence it is clear that they cannot be held to lose by their secession what is not restored to them when they return. Nor ought it for a moment to be said that, as their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is their own, as their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is their own, as the sacrilege of disunion is their own, so also the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is their own, which is really Christ's. Accordingly, while the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> which are their own are corrected when they return, so in that which is not theirs His presence should be recognised, from whom it is.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>17. But the blessed Cyprian shows that it was no new or sudden thing that he decided, because the practice had already begun under <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>. "Many years," he says, "and much time has passed away since, under <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a> of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> memory, a large assembly of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> determined this point." Accordingly, under <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, at any rate, the thing was new. But I cannot understand what Cyprian means by saying, "And thenceforward to the present day, so many thousand <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in our provinces, having been converted to our Church, showed no hesitation or dislike, but rather with full consent of reason and will, have embraced the opportunity of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the laver of life and the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>,"  unless indeed he says, "thenceforward to the present day," because from the time when they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in accordance with the Council of <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, no question of excommunication had arisen in the case of any of the rebaptized. Yet if the custom of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> those who came over from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> remained in force from the time of <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a> to that of Cyprian, why should new Councils have been held by Cyprian on this point? Why does he say to this same Jubaianus that he is not doing anything new or sudden, but only what had been established by <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>? For why should Jubaianus be disturbed by the question of novelty, so as to require to be satisfied by the authority of <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a>, if this was the continuous practice of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agrippinus</a> till Cyprian? Why, lastly, did so many of his colleagues urge that reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> must be preferred to custom, instead of saying that those who wished to act otherwise were acting contrary to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and custom alike?</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>18. But as regards the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, whether it is granted through <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> at the hands of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, I have already expressed my opinion on this point in a former book;  but I will shortly recapitulate it here. If remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is there conferred by the sacredness of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> return again through obstinate perseverance in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; and therefore such men must needs return to the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that they may cease to be <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, and deserve that those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which had returned on them should be cleansed away by <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> working in the bond of unity. But if, although among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics it be still the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it yet cannot work remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> owing to this same foulness of discord and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of dissent, then the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> begins to be of avail for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> when they come to the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash;[not]  that what has been already <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> remitted should not be retained; nor that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be repudiated as belonging to a different religion, or as being different from our own, so that a second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be administered; but that the very same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which was working death by reason of discord outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, may work <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> by reason of the peace within. It was, in fact, the same savor of which the apostle says, "We are a sweet savor of Christ in every place;" and yet, says he, "both in them that are saved and in them that perish. To the one we are the savor of life unto life; and to the other the savor of death unto death." <span class="stiki" id="note141288"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15-16</a></span> And although he used these words with reference to another subject, I have applied them to this, that men may understand that what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> may not only work life to those who use it aright, but also death to those who use it wrong.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>19. Nor is it material, when we are considering the question of the genuineness and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the sacrament, "what the recipient of the sacrament believes, and with what <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> he is imbued." It is of the very highest consequence as regards the entrance into <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but is wholly immaterial as regards the question of the sacrament. For it is quite possible that a man may be possessed of the genuine sacrament and a corrupted <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, as it is possible that he may hold the words of the creed in their integrity, and yet entertain an erroneous belief about the Trinity, or the resurrection, or any other point. For it is no slight matter, even within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, to hold a <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> entirely consistent with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about even God Himself, to say nothing of any of His creatures. Is it then to be maintained, that if any one who has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself should afterwards, in the course of reading, or by listening to instruction, or by quiet argument, find out, through God's own revelation, that he had before <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> otherwise than he ought, it is requisite that he should therefore be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh? But what carnal and natural man is there who does not stray through the vain conceits  of his own heart, and picture God's nature to himself to be such as he has imagined out of his carnal sense, and differ from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conception of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> as far as vanity from <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? Most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a>, indeed, speaks the apostle, filled with the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: "The natural man," says he, "receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141290"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> And yet herein he was speaking of men whom he himself shows to have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For he says to them, "Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> crucified for you? Or were ye <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note141291"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> These men had therefore the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and yet, inasmuch as their wisdom was of the flesh, what could they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> about God otherwise than according to the perception of their flesh, according to which "the natural man receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>?" To such he says: "I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able. For you are yet carnal." <span class="stiki" id="note141292"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:1-3</a></span> For such are carried about with every wind of doctrine, of which kind he says, "That we be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine." <span class="stiki" id="note141293"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse14">Ephesians&nbsp;4:14</a></span> It is then <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, if these men shall have advanced even to the spiritual age of the inner man, and in the integrity of understanding shall have learned how far different from the requirements of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has been the belief which they have been led by the fallacious character of their conceits to entertain of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are therefore to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again? For, on this principle, it would be possible for a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> catechumen to light upon the writings of some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and, not having the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> requisite for discerning <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, he might entertain some belief contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, yet not condemned by the words of the creed, just as, under color of the same words, innumerable <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> have sprung up. Supposing, then, that the catechumen was under the impression that he was studying the work of some great and learned <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with that belief in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by subsequent research should discover what he ought to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, so that, embracing the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, he should reject his former <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, ought he, on confessing this, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again? Or supposing that, before learning and confessing this for himself, he should be found to entertain such an opinion, and should be taught what he ought to reject and what he should <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, and it were to become clear that he had held this false belief when he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, ought he therefore to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again? Why should we maintain the contrary? Because the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of the sacrament, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the words of the gospel, remains upon him in its integrity, just as he received it from the hands of the minister, although he, being firmly rooted in the vanity of his carnal mind entertained a belief other than was right at the time when he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Wherefore it is manifest that it is possible that, with defective <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> may yet remain without defect in any man; and therefore all that is said about the diversity of the several <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is beside the question. For in each person that is to be corrected which is found to be amiss by the man who undertakes his correction. That is to be made whole which is unsound; that is to be given which is wanting, and, above all, the peace of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity, without which the rest is profitless. Yet, as the rest is there, we must not administer it as though it were wanting, only take care that its possession be to the profit, not the hurt of him who has it, through the very bond of peace and excellence of charity.</p>

<p>20. Accordingly, if <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> with the words of the gospel, "In the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141294"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> the sacrament was complete, although his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> expressed under the same words, seeing that he held opinions not taught by the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, was not complete, but stained with the falsity of fables.  For under these same words, "In the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," not <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> only, or <a href="../cathen/15256a.htm">Valentinus</a>, or <a href="../cathen/01718a.htm">Arius</a>, or Eunomius, but the carnal babes of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> themselves (to whom the apostle said, "I could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal"), if they could be individually asked for an accurate exposition of their opinions, would probably show a diversity of opinions as numerous as the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who held them, "for the natural man receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>." Can it, however, be said on this account that they do not receive the complete sacrament? Or that, if they shall advance, and correct the vanity of their carnal opinions, they must seek again what they had received? Each man receives after the fashion of his own <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; yet how much does he obtain under the guidance of that mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in the confident assurance of which the same apostle says, "If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you"? <span class="stiki" id="note141296"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> Yet the snares of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics prove for this reason only too pernicious to the carnally-minded, because their very progress is intercepted when their vain opinions are confirmed in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and the perversity of their dissension is strengthened against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peace. Yet if the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are the same, they are everywhere complete, even when they are wrongly understood, and perverted to be instruments of discord, just as the very writings of the gospel, if they are only the same, are everywhere complete, even though quoted with a boundless variety of false opinions. For as to what Jeremiah says:&mdash; "Why do those who grieve me prevail against me? My wound is stubborn, whence shall I be healed? In its origin it became unto me as lying water, having no certainty," &mdash; if the term "water" were never used figuratively and in the allegorical language of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> except to signify <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, we should have trouble in discovering what these words of Jeremiah meant; but as it is, when "waters" are expressly used in the Apocalypse <span class="stiki" id="note141298"><a href="../bible/rev017.htm#verse15">Revelation&nbsp;17:15</a></span> to signify "peoples," I do not see why, by "lying water having no certainty," I should not understand, a "lying people, whom I cannot trust."</p>

But when it is said that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is given by the imposition of hands in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> only, I suppose that our ancestors meant that we should understand thereby what the apostle says, "Because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given unto us." <span class="stiki" id="note141299"><a href="../bible/rom005.htm#verse5">Romans&nbsp;5:5</a></span> For this is that very <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which is wanting in all who are cut off from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and for lack of this, "though they speak with the tongues of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, though they understand all <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> and all <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and though they have the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>, and all <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, so that they could remove mountains, and though they bestow all their goods to feed the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">poor</a>, and though they give their bodies to be burned, it profits them nothing." <span class="stiki" id="note141300"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:1-3</a></span> But those are wanting in God's <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> who do not care for the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and consequently we are right in understanding that the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> may be said not to be received except in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> Church. For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is not only given by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> amid the testimony of temporal sensible <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, as He was given in former days to be the credentials of a rudimentary <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and for the extension of the first beginnings of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For who expects in these days that those on whom hands are laid that they may receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> should immediately begin to speak with tongues? But it is understood that invisibly and imperceptibly, on account of the bond of peace, divine <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> is breathed into their hearts, so that they may be able to say, "Because the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> which is given unto us." But there are many operations of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which the same apostle commemorates in a certain passage at such length as he thinks sufficient, and then concludes: "But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as He will." <span class="stiki" id="note141301"><a href="../bible/1co012.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;12:11</a></span> Since, then, the sacrament is one thing, which even <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> could have; <span class="stiki" id="note141302"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;8:13</a></span> and the operation of the Spirit is another thing, which is even often found in <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, as Saul had the gift of <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a>;  and that operation of the same Spirit is a third thing, which only the good can have, as "the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned:" <span class="stiki" id="note141304"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> whatever, therefore, may be received by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, the charity which covers the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is the special gift of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity and peace; nor is it found in all that are within that bond, since not all that are within it are of it, as we shall see in the proper place. At any rate, outside the bond that <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> cannot exist, without which all the other requisites, even if they can be recognized and approved, cannot profit or release from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> in reconciliation to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not, like <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, incapable of repetition; for what is it more than a <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> offered over a man? </p>

<h2>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p>22. "For as regards the fact that to preserve the figure of unity the Lord gave the power to Peter that whatsoever he should loose on earth should be loosed," <span class="stiki" id="note141306"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;16:19</a></span> it is clear that that unity is also described as one dove without fault. <span class="stiki" id="note141307"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:9</a></span> Can it be said, then, that to this same dove belong all those greedy ones, whose <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> Cyprian himself so grievously bewailed? For birds of prey, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, cannot be called doves, but rather hawks. How then did they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who used to plunder estates by treacherous deceit, and increase their profits by compound <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>,  if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is only given by that indivisible and chaste and perfect dove, that unity which can only be understood as existing among the good? Is it possible that, by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are spiritual within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as though by the frequent lamentations of the dove, a great sacrament is dispensed, with a secret administration of the mercy of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, so that their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> also are loosed who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not by the dove but by the hawk, if they come to that sacrament in the peace of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity? But if this be so, why should it not also be the case that, as each man comes from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peace, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be loosed through their <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>? But the integrity of the sacrament is everywhere recognized, though it will not avail for the irrevocable remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> outside the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nor will the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, or, in other words, the groanings of that one dove, be able to help one who is set in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; just as they are not able to help one who is placed within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if by a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life he himself retain the debts of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> against himself, and that though he be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, not by this hawk, but by the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> ministry of the dove herself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18</h2>

<p>23. "As my Father has sent me," says our Lord, "even so send I you. And what He had said this, He breathed on them, and says unto them, Receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. Whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they are retained." <span class="stiki" id="note141309"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;20:21-23</a></span> Therefore, if they represented the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and this was said to them as to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, it follows that the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> looses <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and estrangement from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> retains them, not according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, but according to the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> who are spiritual, who "judge all things, but themselves are judged of no man." <span class="stiki" id="note141310"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> For the rock retains, the rock remits; the dove retains, the dove remits; unity retains, unity remits. But the peace of this unity exists only in the good, in those who are either already spiritual, or are advancing by the <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> of concord to spiritual things; it exists not in the bad, whether they make disturbances abroad, or are endured within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with lamentations,  <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> and being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But just as those who are tolerated with groanings within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although they do not belong to the same unity of the dove, and to that "<a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing,"  yet if they are corrected, and confess that they approached to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> most unworthily, are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, but begin to belong to the dove, through whose groans those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted which were retained in them who were estranged from her peace; so those also who are more openly without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if they have received the same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, are not freed from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> on coming, after correction, to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, by a repetition of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but by the same law of charity and bond of unity. For if "those only may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> who are set over the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and established by the law of the gospel and ordination as appointed by the Lord," were they in any wise of this kind who seized on estates by treacherous frauds, and increased their gains by compound interest? I trow not, since those are established by ordination as appointed of the Lord, of whom the apostle, in giving them a standard, says, "Not greedy, not given to filthy lucre." <span class="stiki" id="note141312"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse7">Titus&nbsp;1:7</a></span> Yet men of this kind used to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the time of Cyprian himself; and he confesses with many lamentations that they were his fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, and endures them with the great reward of tolerance. Yet did they not confer remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which is granted through the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, that is, the groans of the dove, whoever it be that baptizes, if those to whom it is given belong to her peace. For the Lord would not say to <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> and <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>, "Whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they shall be remitted to him; and whose soever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they shall be retained." "Outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, indeed, nothing can be either bound or loosed, since there there is no one who can either bind or loose;" but he is loosed who has made peace with the dove, and he is bound who is not at peace with the dove, whether he is openly without, or appears to be within.</p>

<p>24. But we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that Dathan, Korah, and Abiram, <span class="stiki" id="note141313"><a href="../bible/num016.htm">Numbers&nbsp;xvi</a></span> who tried to usurp to themselves the right of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>, contrary to the unity of the people of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and also the sons of <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> who offered strange fire upon the altar, <span class="stiki" id="note141314"><a href="../bible/lev010.htm#verse1">Leviticus&nbsp;10:1-2</a></span> did not escape punishment. Nor do we say that such offenses remain unpunished, unless those guilty of them correct themselves, if the patience of God leading them to repentance <span class="stiki" id="note141315"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;2:4</a></span> give them time for correction.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p>25. They indeed who say that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not to be repeated, because only hands were laid on those whom Philip the <a href="../cathen/04647c.htm">deacon</a> had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note141316"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse5">Acts&nbsp;8:5-17</a></span> are saying what is quite beside the point; and far be it from us, in seeking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to use such arguments as this. Wherefore we are all the further from "yielding to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,"  if we deny that what they possess of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> Church is their own property, and do not refuse to acknowledge the standard of our General because of the crimes of deserters; nay, all the more because "the Lord our God is a jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141318"><a href="../bible/deu004.htm#verse24">Deuteronomy&nbsp;4:24</a></span> let us refuse, whenever we see anything of His with an alien, to allow him to consider it his own. For of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> the jealous God Himself rebukes the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who commits fornication against Him, as the type of an erring people, and says that she gave to her lovers what belonged to Him, and again received from them what was not theirs but His. In the hands of the adulterous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> and the adulterous lovers, God in His <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, as a jealous <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, recognizes His gifts; and do we say that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the words of the gospel, belongs to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>? And are we willing, from consideration of their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, to attribute to them even what belongs to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as though they had the power to pollute it, or as though they could make what is God's to be their own, because they themselves have refused to belong to God?</p>

<p>26. Who is that adulterous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Hosea points out, who said, "I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, and everything that befits me?"  Let us grant that we may understand this also of the people of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> that went astray; yet whom else are the false <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> (such as are all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics) wont to imitate, except false <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>? For there were also <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israelites</a>, as the Lord Himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to Nathanael, "Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile." <span class="stiki" id="note141320"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse47">John&nbsp;1:47</a></span> But who are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, save those of whom the same Lord said, "He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me?" <span class="stiki" id="note141321"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;14:21</a></span> But what is it to keep His commandments, except to abide in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>? Whence also He says, "A new commandment I give unto you, that you <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one another;" and again, "By this shall all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you are my <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, if you have <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> one to another." <span class="stiki" id="note141322"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse34">John&nbsp;13:34-35</a></span> But who can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that this was spoken not only to those who heard His words with their fleshly ears when He was present with them, but also to those who learn His words through the gospel, when He is sitting on His throne in heaven? For He came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill. <span class="stiki" id="note141323"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;5:17</a></span> But the fulfilling of the law is <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note141324"><a href="../bible/rom013.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;13:10</a></span> And in this Cyprian abounded greatly, insomuch that though he held a different view concerning <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he yet did not forsake the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and was in the Lord's vine a branch firmly rooted, bearing fruit, which the heavenly Husbandman purged with the knife of suffering, that it should bear more fruit. <span class="stiki" id="note141325"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse1">John&nbsp;15:1-5</a></span> But the enemies of this brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, whether they are openly without, or appear to be within, are false <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and antichrists. For when they have found an opportunity, they go out, as it is written: "A man wishing to separate himself from his friends, seeks opportunities."  But even if occasions are wanting, while they seem to be within, they are severed from that invisible bond of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. Whence St. John says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for had they been of us, they would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have continued with us." <span class="stiki" id="note141327"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> He does not say that they ceased to be of us by going out, but that they went out because they were not of us. The <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> also speaks of certain men who had erred concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and were overthrowing the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some; whose word was eating as a canker. Yet in saying that they should be avoided, he nevertheless intimates that they were all in one great house, but as vessels to dishonor&mdash;I suppose because they had not as yet gone out. Or if they had already gone out, how can he say that they were in the same great house with the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honorable</a> vessels, unless it was in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> themselves, which even in the severed meetings of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are not changed, that he speaks of all as belonging to the same great house, though in different degrees of esteem, some to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and some to dishonor? For thus he speaks in his Epistle to Timothy: "But shun profane and vain babblings; for they will increase unto more ungodliness. And their word will eat as does a canker; of whom is Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus; who concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some. Nevertheless the foundation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stands firm, having this seal, The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and some to dishonor. If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work." <span class="stiki" id="note141328"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:16-21</a></span> But what is it to purge oneself from such as these, except what he said just before, "Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity." And lest any one should think that, as being in one great house with them, he might perish with such as these, he has most carefully forewarned them, "The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His,"&mdash; those, namely, who, by departing from iniquity, purge themselves from the vessels made to dishonor, lest they should perish with them whom they are compelled to tolerate in the great house.</p>

<p>27. They, therefore, who are <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, evildoers, carnal, fleshly, devilish, think that they receive at the hands of their seducers what are the gifts of God alone, whether <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, or any spiritual workings about present <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But these men have not <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but are busied about those by whose <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> they are led astray, and are compared to the adulterous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> introduces as saying, "I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, and my oil, and everything that befits me." For thus arise <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms, when the fleshly people which is not founded on the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of God says, "I will go after my lovers," with whom, either by corruption of her <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or by the puffing up of her <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, she shamefully commits <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. But for the sake of those who, having undergone the difficulties, and straits, and barriers of the empty reasoning of those by whom they are led astray, afterwards feel the prickings of <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, and return to the way of peace, to seeking God in all sincerity&mdash;for their sake He goes on to say, "Therefore, behold, I will hedge up your way with thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths. And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them: and she shall seek them, but she shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now." Then, that they may not attribute to their seducers what they have that is sound, and derived from the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, by which they lead them astray to the falseness of their own <a href="../cathen/05089a.htm">dogmas</a> and dissensions; that they may not think that what is sound in them belongs to them, he immediately added, "And she did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I gave her grain, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her money; but she made vessels of gold and silver for <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a>."  For she had said above, "I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread," etc., not at all understanding that all this, which was held soundly and lawfully by her seducers, was of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and not of men. Nor would even they themselves claim these things for themselves, and as it were assert a right in them, had not they in turn been led astray by a people which had gone astray, when <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is reposed in them, and such <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honors</a> are paid to them, that they should be enabled thereby to say such things, and claim such things for themselves, that their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> should be called <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and their iniquity be thought righteousness, in virtue of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and Scriptures, which they hold, not for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but only in appearance. Accordingly, the same adulterous <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is addressed by the mouth of Ezekiel: "You have also taken your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made to yourself images of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and committed whoredom with them; and tookest my  broidered garments, and covered them: and you have set mine oil and mine <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a> before them. My meat also which I gave you, fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed you, you have even set it before your <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> for a sweet savor: and this you have done." <span class="stiki" id="note141331"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse17">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:17-19</a></span> For she turns all the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and the words of the sacred books, to the images of her own <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, with which her carnal mind delights to wallow. Nor yet, because those images are false, and the doctrines of devils, speaking lies in hypocrisy, <span class="stiki" id="note141332"><a href="../bible/1ti004.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;4:1-2</a></span> are those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and divine utterances therefore so to lose their due <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, as to be thought to belong to such as these; seeing that the Lord says," Of my gold, and my silver, and my broidered garments, and mine oil, and mine <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, and my meat," and so forth. Ought we, because those erring ones think that these things belong to their seducers, therefore not to recognize whose they really are, when He Himself says, "And she did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I gave her grain, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her money"? For He did not say that she did not have these things because she was an adulteress; but she is said to have had them, and that not as belonging to herself or her lovers, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose alone they are. Although, therefore, she had her fornication, yet those things wherewith she adorned it, whether as seduced or in her turn seducing, belonged not to her, but to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If these things were spoken in a figure of the <a href="../cathen/08386a.htm">Jewish</a> nation, when the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> were rejecting the commandment of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in order to set up their own traditions, so that they were in a manner committing whoredom with a people which was abandoning their <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and yet for all that, whoredom at that time among the people, such as the Lord brought to light by convicting it, did not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a> should belong to them, which were not theirs but God's, who, in speaking to the adulteress, says that all these things were His; whence the Lord Himself also sent those whom He cleansed from <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">leprosy</a> to the same <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, that they should offer <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> for themselves before the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, because that <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> had not become efficacious for them, which He Himself afterwards wished to be commemorated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> for all of them, because He Himself proclaimed the tidings to them all&mdash;if this be so, how much the more ought we, when we find the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14530a.htm">New Testament</a> among certain <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics, not to attribute them to these men, nor to condemn them, as though we could not recognize them? We ought to recognize the gifts of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> husband, though in the possession of an adulteress, and to amend, by the word of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that whoredom which is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> possession of the unchaste <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, instead of finding fault with the gifts, which belong entirely to the pitying Lord.</p>

<p>28. From these considerations, and such as these, our forefathers, not only before the time of Cyprian and <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agripinnus</a>, but even afterwards, maintained a most wholesome custom, that whenever they found anything divine and lawful remaining in its integrity even in the midst of any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, they approved rather than repudiated it; but whatever they found that was alien, and peculiar to that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">false doctrine</a> or division, this they convicted in the light of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and healed. The points, however, which remain to be considered in the letter written by Jubaianus, must, I think, when looking at the size of this book, be taken in hand and treated with a fresh beginning.</p>
