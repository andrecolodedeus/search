<h1>On Baptism, Against the Donatists (Book IV)</h1>

<p><strong>In which he treats of what follows in the same epistle of Cyprian to Jubaianus.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. The comparison of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with Paradise  shows us that men may indeed receive her <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> outside her pale, but that no one outside can either receive or retain the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a>. For, as the words of Scripture testify, the streams from the fountain of Paradise flowed copiously even beyond its bounds. Record indeed is made of their names; and through what countries they flow, and that they are situated beyond the limits of Paradise, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to all; <span class="stiki" id="note141334"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse8">Genesis&nbsp;2:8-14</a></span> and yet in Mesopotamia, and in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, to which countries those rivers extended, there is not found that blessedness of life which is recorded in Paradise. Accordingly, though the waters of Paradise are found beyond its boundaries, yet its <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is in Paradise alone. So, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may exist outside, but the gift of the life of <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> is found alone within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has been founded on a rock, which has received the keys of binding and loosing. <span class="stiki" id="note141335"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18-19</a></span> "She it is alone who holds as her privilege the whole power of her Bridegroom and Lord;"  by virtue of which power as bride, she can bring forth sons even of handmaids. And these, if they be not high-minded, shall be called into the lot of the inheritance; but if they be high-minded, they shall remain outside.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>2. All the more, then, because "we are fighting  for the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> and unity" of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let us beware of giving to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> the credit of whatever we acknowledged among them as belonging to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but let us teach them by argument, that what they possess that is derived from unity is of no efficacy to their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, unless they shall return to that same unity. For "the water of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is full of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>"  to those who use it rightly. No one, however, can use it well outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But to those who use it perversely, whether within or without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is employed to work punishment, and does not conduce to their reward. And so <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> "cannot be corrupted and polluted," though it be handled by the corrupt or by adulterers, just as also "the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself is uncorrupt, and pure, and chaste."  And so no share in it belongs to the avaricious, or thieves, or <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>&mdash;many of whom, by the testimony of Cyprian himself in many places of his letters, exist not only without, but actually within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash;and yet they both are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and do <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, with no change in their hearts.</p>

<p>3. For this, too, he says, in one of his epistles  to the <a href="../cathen/04049b.htm">clergy</a> on the subject of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> toGod, in which, after the fashion of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Daniel, he represents the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of his people as falling upon himself. For among many other <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of which he makes mention, he speaks of them also as "renouncing the world in words only and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>;" as the apostle says of certain men, "They profess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in works they deny Him." <span class="stiki" id="note141341"><a href="../bible/tit001.htm#verse16">Titus&nbsp;1:16</a></span> These, therefore, the blessed Cyprian shows to be contained within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without their hearts being changed for the better, seeing that they renounce the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, as the Apostle Peter says, "The like figure whereunto even <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does also now save us, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>)," <span class="stiki" id="note141342"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse21">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:21</a></span> which certainly they had not of whom it is said that they "renounced the world in words only, and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>;" and yet he does his utmost, by chiding and convincing them, to make them at length walk in the way of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and be His friends rather than friends of the world.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>4. And if they would have <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> him, and begun to live rightly, not as false but as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, would he have ordered them to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anew? Surely not; but their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion would have gained this for them, that the sacrament which availed for their destruction while they were yet unchanged, should begin when they changed to avail for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<p>5. For neither are they "devoted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>"  who seem to be within and live contrary to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, act against His commandments; nor can they be considered in any way to belong to that Church, which He so purifies by the washing of water, "that He may present to Himself a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing." <span class="stiki" id="note141344"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse26">Ephesians&nbsp;5:26-27</a></span> But if they are not in that Church to whose members they do not belong, they are not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of which it is said, "My dove is but one; she is the only one of her mother;" <span class="stiki" id="note141345"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:9</a></span> for she herself is without spot or wrinkle. Or else let him who can assert that those are members of this dove who renounce the world in words but not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. Meantime there is one thing which we see, from which I think it was said, "He that regards the day, regards it unto the Lord," <span class="stiki" id="note141346"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;14:6</a></span> for God judges every day. For, according to His foreknowledge, who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> whom He has foreordained before the foundation of the world to be made like to the image of His Son, many who are even openly outside, and are called <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, are better than many good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>. For we see what they are today, what they shall be tomorrow we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not. And with <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, with whom the future is already present, they already are what they shall hereafter be. But we, according to what each man is at present, inquire whether they are to be today reckoned among the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which is called the one dove, and the Bride of Christ without a spot or wrinkle,  of whom Cyprian says in the letter which I have quoted above, that "they did not keep in the way of the Lord, nor observe the commandments given unto them for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; that they did not fulfill the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of their Lord, being eager about their property and gains, following the dictates of <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, giving way to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and dissension, careless about single-mindedness and <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, renouncing the world in words only and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, pleasing each himself, and displeasing all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>."  But if the dove does not acknowledge them among her members, and if the Lord shall say to them, supposing that they continue in the same perversity, "I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you: depart from me, you that work iniquity;" <span class="stiki" id="note141349"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;7:23</a></span> then they seem indeed to be in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but are not; "nay, they even act against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. How then can they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,"  which is of avail neither to themselves, nor to those who receive it from them, unless they are changed in heart with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion, so that the sacrament itself, which did not avail them when they received it while they were renouncing the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, may begin to profit them when they shall begin to renounce it in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> also? And so too in the case of those whose separation from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is open; for neither these nor those are as yet among the members of the dove, but some of them perhaps will be at some future time.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>6. We do not, therefore, "acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,"  when we refuse to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> after them; but because we acknowledge the ordinance to be of Christ even among <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men, whether openly separated from us, or secretly severed while within our body, we receive it with due respect, having corrected those who were wrong in the points wherein they went astray. However as I seem to be hard pressed when it is said to me, "Does then a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> confer remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?" so I in turn press hard when I say, Does then he who violates the commands of <a href="../cathen/07170a.htm">Heaven</a>, the avaricious man, the robber, the usurer, the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> man, does he who renounces the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, confer such remission? If you mean by the force of God's sacrament, then both the one and the other; if by his own merit, neither of them. For that sacrament, even in the hands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, is <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be of Christ; but neither the one nor the other of these men is found in the body of the one uncorrupt, <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, chaste dove, which has neither spot nor wrinkle. And just as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is of no profit to the man who renounces the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, so it is of no profit to him who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; but each of them, when he amends his ways, begins to receive profit from that which before was not profitable, but was yet already in him.</p>

<p>7. "He therefore that is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> does not become the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;  but does it therefore follow that he is not to be considered as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? For neither does the avaricious man, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, become the temple of God unless he depart from his <a href="../cathen/02148b.htm">avarice</a>; for they who become the temple of God certainly inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. But the apostle says, among many other things, "Neither the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, nor extortioners, shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141353"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> For in another place the same apostle compares <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> to the worship of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>: "Nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man," he says, "who is an idolater;" <span class="stiki" id="note141354"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> which meaning the same Cyprian has so far extended in a letter to Antonianus, that he did not hesitate to compare the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> with that of men who in time of <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecution</a> had declared in writing that they would offer <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>.  The man, then, who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the name of the Holy Trinity, yet does not become the temple of God unless he abandons his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, just as the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man who has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the same name does not become the temple of God unless he abandons his <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For this, too, the same apostle says: "What agreement has the temple of God with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note141356"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> Let it not, then, be asked of us "of what God he is made the temple"  when we say that he is not made the temple of God at all. Yet he is not therefore unbaptized, nor does his foul <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that what he has received, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the words of the gospel, should not be the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> sacrament; just as the other man's <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> (which is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>) and great uncleanness cannot prevent what he receives from being <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, even though he be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the same words of the gospel by another man <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> like himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>8. "Further," Cyprian goes on to say, "in vain do some, who are overcome by reason, oppose to us custom, as though custom were superior to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, or that were not to be followed in spiritual things which has been revealed by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, as the better way."  This is clearly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, since reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> are to be preferred to custom. But when <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> supports custom, nothing should be more strongly maintained. Then he proceeds as follows: "For one may pardon a man who merely <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says of himself, 'Who was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, because I did it <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a>;' <span class="stiki" id="note141359"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:13</a></span> but he who, after inspiration and revelation given, perseveres advisedly and knowingly in his former <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> without hope of pardon on the ground of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. For he rests on a kind of presumption and obstinacy, when he is overcome by reason." This is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is much more grievous who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> wittingly than his who has <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>. And so in the case of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyprian, who was not only learned, but also patient of instruction, which he so fully himself understood to be a part of the praise of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> whom the apostle describes, <span class="stiki" id="note141360"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse24">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:24</a></span> that he said, "This also should be approved in a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, that he not only teach with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, but also learn with patience."  I do not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that if he had had the opportunity of discussing this question, which has been so long and so much disputed in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with the <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> and learned men to whom we owe it that subsequently that ancient custom was confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council, he would have shown, without hesitation, not only how learned he was in those things which he had grasped with all the security of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but also how ready he was to receive instruction in what he had failed to perceive. And yet, since it is so clear that it is much more grievous to <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wittingly than in <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, I should be glad if any one would tell me which is the worse&mdash;the man who falls into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> how great a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> it is, or the man who refuses to abandon his <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowing</a> its enormity? I might even put the question thus: If one man unwittingly fall into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and another knowingly refuse to depart from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, since the apostle himself says, "The <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, which is an idolater;" and Cyprian too understood the same passage in just the same way, when he says, in his letter to Antonianus, "Nor let the new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> flatter themselves in this, that they say they do not communicate with idolaters, whereas there are among them both adulterers and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, who are held guilty of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; 'for <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> this, and understand, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;' <span class="stiki" id="note141362"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> and again, 'Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscence, and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.'"  I ask, therefore, which <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> more deeply&mdash;he who <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a> has fallen into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or he who wittingly has refused to abandon <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, that is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>? According to that rule by which the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those who <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> wittingly are placed before those of the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, the man who is <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> takes the first place in <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. But as it is possible that the greatness of the actual <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> should produce the same effect in the case of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> that the witting commission of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> produces in that of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, let us suppose the <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> to be on a par in guilt with the consciously <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, although the evidence which Cyprian himself has advanced from the apostle does not seem to prove this. For what is it that we abominate in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> except their <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemies</a>? But when he wished to show that <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> may conduce to ease in obtaining pardon, he advanced a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the case of the apostle, when he says, "Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; but I obtained mercy, because I did it <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorantly</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141364"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:13</a></span> But if possible, as I said before, let the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of the two men&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of the unconscious, and the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> of the conscious sinner&mdash; be esteemed of equal weight; and let them be judged by the same sentence&mdash;he who, in seeking for <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, falls into a truth-like setting forth of what is false, and he who wittingly resists Christ speaking through His apostle, "seeing that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, which is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141365"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> &mdash; and then I would ask why <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the words of the gospel are held as naught in the former case, and accounted valid in the latter, when each is alike found to be estranged from the members of the dove. Is it because the former is an open combatant outside, that he should not be admitted, the latter a cunning assenter within the fold, that he may not be expelled?</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>9. But as regards his saying, "Nor let any one affirm that what they have received from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that they follow; for the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> handed down only one Church and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and that appointed only in the same Church:"  this does not so much move me to venture to condemn the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ when found among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> (just as it is necessary to recognize the gospel itself when I find it with them, though I abominate their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>), as it warns me that there were some even in the times of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyprian who traced to the authority of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> that custom against which the African Councils were held, and in respect of which he himself said a little above, "In vain do those who are beaten by reason oppose to us the authority of custom." Nor do I find the reason why the same Cyprian found this very custom, which after his time was confirmed by nothing less than a plenary Council of the whole world, already so strong before his time, that when with all his learning he sought an authority worth following for changing it, he found nothing but a Council of <a href="../cathen/01232a.htm">Agripinnus</a> held in Africa a very few years before his own time. And seeing that this was not enough for him, as against the custom of the whole world, he laid hold on these reasons which we just now, considering them with great care, and being confirmed by the antiquity of the custom itself, and by the subsequent authority of a plenary Council, found to be truth-like rather than <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; which, however, seemed to him <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, as he toiled in a question of the greatest obscurity, and was in <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> about the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash;whether it could fail to be given in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and whether it could be given among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. In which matter, if an imperfect revelation of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> was given to Cyprian, that the greatness of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in not deserting the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> might be made manifest, there is yet not any reason why any one should venture to claim superiority over the strong defenses and excellence of his <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a>, and the abundance of graces which were found in him, merely because, with the instruction derived from the strength of a general Council, he sees something which Cyprian did not see, because the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> had not yet held a plenary Council on the matter. Just as no one is so insane as to set himself up as surpassing the merits of the Apostle Peter, because, taught by the epistles of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, and confirmed by the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, he does not compel the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to judaize, as Peter once had done. <span class="stiki" id="note141367"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> </p>

<p>10. We do not then "find that any one, after being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, was afterwards admitted by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and communicated;"  but neither do we find this, that any one coming from the society of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among them, was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anew by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But this custom, which even then those who looked back to past ages could not find to have been invented by men of a later time, is rightly <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been handed down from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. And there are many other things of the same kind, which it would be tedious to recount. Wherefore, if they had something to say for themselves to whom Cyprian, wishing to persuade them of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of his own view, says, "Let no one say, What we have received from the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that we follow," with how much more force we now say, What the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has always held, what this argument has failed to prove false, and what a plenary Council has confirmed, this we follow! To this we may add that it may also be said, after a careful inquiry into the reasoning on both sides of the discussion, and into the evidence of Scripture, What <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> has declared, that we follow.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>11. For in fact, as to what some opposed to the reasoning of Cyprian, that the apostle says, "Notwithstanding every way, whether in pretence or in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, let Christ be preached;"  Cyprian rightly exposed their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, showing that it has nothing to do with the case of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, since the apostle was speaking of those who were acting within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, with malicious <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> seeking their own profit. They announced Christ, indeed, according to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> whereby we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but not in the spirit in which He was announced by the good <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelists</a> to the sons of the dove. "For <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>," he says, "in his epistle was not speaking of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or of their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so that it could be shown that he had laid down anything concerning this matter. He was speaking of brethren, whether as walking disorderly and contrary to the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or as keeping the discipline of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And he declared that some of them spoke the word of God steadfastly and fearlessly, but that some were acting in <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and strife; that some had kept themselves encompassed with kindly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but that others entertained <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and strife: but yet that he patiently endured all things, with the view that, whether in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or in pretence, the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> preached, might come to the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the greatest number, and that the sowing of the word, which was as yet a new and unaccustomed work, might spread more widely by the preaching of those that spoke. Furthermore, it is one thing for those who are within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to speak in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, another thing for those who are without, acting against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."  These words of Cyprian seem to warn us that we must distinguish between those who are bad outside, and those who are bad within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And those whom he says that the apostle represents as preaching the gospel impurely and of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, he says <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> were within. This much, however, I think I may say without rashness, if no one outside can have anything which is of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, neither can any one within have anything which is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For if that closed garden can contain the thorns of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, why cannot the fountain of Christ equally flow beyond the garden's bounds? But if it cannot contain them, whence, even in the time of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> himself, did there arise among those who were within so great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and malicious strife? For these are the words of Cyprian. Can it be that <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and malicious strife are a small <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>? How then were those in unity who were not at peace? For it is not my voice, nor that of any man, but of the Lord Himself; nor did the sound go forth from men, but from <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, at the birth of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, "Glory to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will."  And this certainly would not have been proclaimed by the voice of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> when Christ was born upon the earth, unless God wished this to be understood, that those are in the unity of the body of Christ who are united in the peace of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and those are in the peace of Christ who are of good will. Furthermore, as good will is shown in kindliness, so is bad will shown in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>12. In short, we may see how great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in itself is <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>, which cannot be other than malicious. Let us not look for other testimony. Cyprian himself is sufficient for us, through whose mouth the Lord poured forth so many thunders in most perfect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and uttered so many useful precepts about <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and malignity. Let us therefore read the letter of Cyprian about <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and malignity, and see how great an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> it is to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> those better than ourselves&mdash;an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> whose origin he shows in memorable words to have sprung from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> himself. "To feel jealousy," he says, "of what you regard as good, and to <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> those who are better than yourselves, to some, dearest brethren, seems a light and minute offense."  And again a little later, when he was inquiring into the source and origin of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, he says, "From this the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, in the very beginning of the world, perished first himself, and led others to destruction."  And further on in the same chapter: "What an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, dearest brethren, is that by which an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> fell! By which that exalted and illustrious loftiness was able to be deceived and overthrown! By which he was deceived who was the deceiver! From that time <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> stalks upon the earth, when man, about to perish through malignity, submits himself to the teacher of perdition,&mdash; when he who envies imitates the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as it is written, 'Through <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> came death into the world, and they that do hold of his side do find it.'" <span class="stiki" id="note141374"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom&nbsp;2:24-25</a></span> How <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, how forcible are these words of Cyprian, in an epistle <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> throughout the world, we cannot fail to recognize. It was <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> fitting for Cyprian to argue and warn most forcibly about <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and malignity, from which most deadly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> he <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> his own heart to be so far removed by the abundance of his <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; by carefully guarding which he remained in the unity of communion with his colleagues, who without ill-feeling entertained different views about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, while he himself differed in opinion from them, not through any contention of ill will, but through <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, erring in a point which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His own good time, would reveal to him by reason of his perseverance in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>. For he says openly, "Judging no one, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he differ from us. For no one of us sets himself up as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or by tyrannical terror forces his colleagues to a necessity of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a>."  And in the end of the epistle before us he says, "These things I have written to you briefly, dearest brother, according to my poor ability, prescribing to or prejudging no one, so as to prevent each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> from doing what he thinks right in the free exercise of his own judgment. We, so far as in us lies, do not strive on behalf of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> with our colleges and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with whom we hold the harmony that God enjoins, and the peace of our Lord, especially as the apostle says, 'If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note141376"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:16</a></span> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> in our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of our fraternity, the bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, all these are maintained by us with patience and gentleness. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> we have also, so far as our poor ability admitted, by the permission and inspiration of the Lord, written now a treatise on the benefit of patience,  which we have sent to you in consideration of our mutual affection." </p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>13. By this patience of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he not only endured the difference of opinion manifested in all kindliness by his good colleagues on an obscure point, as he also himself received toleration, till, in process of time, when it so pleased <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, what had always been a most wholesome custom was further confirmed by a declaration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in a plenary Council, but he even put up with those who were manifestly bad, as was very well known to himself, who did not entertain a different view in consequence of the obscurity of the question, but acted contrary to their preaching in the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> practices of an abandoned life, as the apostle says of them, "Thou that preachest a man should not steal, do you steal?" <span class="stiki" id="note141379"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;2:21</a></span> For Cyprian says in his letter of such <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of his own time, his own colleagues, and remaining in communion with him, "While they had brethren starving in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they tried to amass large sums of money, they took possession of estates by fraudulent proceedings, they multiplied their gains by accumulated usuries."  For here there is no obscure question. Scripture declares openly, "Neither <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> nor extortioners shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note141381"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> and "He that puts out his money to <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>,"  and "No whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141383"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> He therefore certainly would not, without <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, have brought accusations of such <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, that men not only greedily treasured up their own goods, but also fraudulently appropriated the goods of others, or of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> existing in such enormity as he understands and proves it to exist; nor assuredly would he bear false <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> against his fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. And yet with the bowels of fatherly and motherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> he endured them, lest that, by rooting out the tares before their time, the wheat should also have been rooted up, <span class="stiki" id="note141384"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;13:29</a></span> imitating assuredly the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, who, with the same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> towards the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, endured those who were ill-disposed and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> towards him. <span class="stiki" id="note141385"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;1:15-18</a></span> </p>

But yet because "by the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> death entered into the world, and they that do hold of his side do find it," <span class="stiki" id="note141386"><a href="../bible/wis002.htm#verse24">Wisdom&nbsp;2:24-25</a></span> not because they are created by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but because they go astray of themselves, as Cyprian also says himself, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, before he was a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, was an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a>, and good, how can it be that they who are of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> side are in the unity of Christ? Beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, as the Lord Himself says, "an enemy has done this," who "sowed tares among the wheat."  As therefore what is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> within the fold must be convicted, so what is of Christ without must be recognized. Has the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> what is his within the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and shall Christ not have what is His without? This, perhaps, might be said of individual men, that as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has none that are his among the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, so God has none that are His outside the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But though it may be allowed to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> to mingle tares, that is, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, with this Church which still wears the mortal nature of flesh, so long as it is wandering far from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he being allowed this just because of the pilgrimage of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, that men may desire more ardently the rest of that country which the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> enjoy, yet this cannot be said of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>. For, as the tares within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> can have and handle them, though not for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but for the destruction to which they are destined in the fire, so also can the tares without, which received them from seceders from within; for they did not lose them by seceding. This, indeed, is made plain from the fact that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not conferred again on their return, when any of the very men who seceded happen to come back again. And let not any one say, Why, what fruit has the tares? For if this be so, their condition is the same, so far as this goes, both inside and without. For it surely cannot be that grains of grain are found in the tares inside, and not in those without. But when the question is of the sacrament, we do not consider whether the tares bear any fruit, but whether they have any share of heaven; for the tares, both within and without, share the rain with the wheat itself, which rain is in itself heavenly and sweet, even though under its influence the tares grow up in barrenness. And so the sacrament, according to the gospel of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, is divine and pleasant; nor is it to be esteemed as naught because of the barrenness of those on whom its dew falls even without.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>15. But some one may say that the tares within may more easily be converted into wheat. I grant that it is so; but what has this to do with the question of repeating <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? You surely do not maintain that if a man converted from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, through the occasion and opportunity given by his conversion, should bear fruit before another who, being within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is more slow to be washed from his iniquity, and so corrected and changed, the former therefore needs not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, but the churchman to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, who was outstripped by him who came from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, because of the greater slowness of his amendment. It has nothing, therefore, to do with the question now at issue who is later or slower in being converted from his special waywardness to the straight path of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, or hope, or charity. For although the bad within the fold are more easily made good yet it will sometimes happen that certain of the number of those outside will outstrip in their conversion certain of those within; and while these remain in barrenness, the former, being restored to unity and communion, will bear fruit with patience, thirty-fold, or sixty-fold, or a hundred-fold.  Or if those only are to be called tares who remain in perverse <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> to the end, there are many ears of grain outside, and many tares within.</p>

<p>16. But it will be urged that the bad outside are worse than those within. It is indeed a weighty question, whether Nicolaus, being already severed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note141389"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse6">Revelation&nbsp;2:6</a></span> or Simon, who was still within it, <span class="stiki" id="note141390"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse9">Acts&nbsp;8:9-24</a></span> was the worse&mdash;the one being a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, the other a sorcerer. But if the mere fact of division, as being the clearest token of violated charity, is held to be the worse <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, I grant that it is so. Yet many, though they have lost all feelings of charity, yet do not secede from considerations of worldly profit; and as they seek their own, not the things which are <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>'s, <span class="stiki" id="note141391"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse21">Philippians&nbsp;2:21</a></span> what they are unwilling to secede from is not the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but their own temporal advantage. Whence it is said in praise of charity, that she "seeks not her own." <span class="stiki" id="note141392"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:5</a></span> </p>

<p>17. Now, therefore, the question is, how could men of the party of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has no spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,  of which also it is said, "My dove is one?" <span class="stiki" id="note141394"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:9</a></span> But if they cannot, it is clear that she groans among those who are not of her, some treacherously laying wait within, some barking at her gate without. Such men, however, even within, both receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and possess it, and transmit it <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in itself; nor is it in any way defiled by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, in which they persevere even to the end. Wherefore the same blessed Cyprian teaches us that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is to be considered as <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in itself by the words of the gospel, as the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has received, without joining to it or mingling with it any consideration of waywardness and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> on the part of either minister or recipients; since he himself points out to us both truths,&mdash; both that there have been some within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who did not cherish kindly <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, but practised <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and unkind dissension, of whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> spoke; and also that the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> belong to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> party, as he testifies in the most open way in the epistle which he wrote about <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and malignity. Wherefore, since it is clearly possible that in those who belong to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> party, Christ's sacrament may yet be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>&mdash;not, indeed, to their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, but to their condemnation, and that not only if they are led astray after they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but even if they were such in heart when they received the sacrament, renouncing the world (as the same Cyprian shows) in words only and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>;  and since even if afterwards they be brought into the right way, the sacrament is not to be again administered which they received when they were astray; so far as I can see, the case is already clear and evident, that in the question of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we have to consider, not who gives, but what he gives; not who receives, but what he receives; not who has, but what he has. For if men of the party of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and therefore in no way belonging to the one dove, can yet receive, and have, and give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in all its <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, in no way defiled by their waywardness, as we are taught by the letters of Cyprian himself, how are we ascribing to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> what does not belong to them? How are we saying that what is really Christ's is theirs, and not rather recognizing in them the signs of our Sovereign, and correcting the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of deserters from Him? Wherefore it is one thing, as the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyprian says, "for those within in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to speak in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, another thing for those without, who are acting against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in His name."  But both many who are within act against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> living, and by enticing weak <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> to copy their lives; and some who are without speak in Christ's name, and are not forbidden to work the works of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but only to be without, since for the healing of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> we grasp at them, or reason with them, or exhort them. For he, too, was without who did not follow Christ with His <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, and yet in Christ's name was casting out devils, which the Lord enjoined that he should not be prevented from doing; <span class="stiki" id="note141397"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse49">Luke&nbsp;9:49-50</a></span> although, certainly, in the point where he was imperfect he was to be made whole, in accordance with the words of the Lord, in which He says, "He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad." <span class="stiki" id="note141398"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> Therefore both some things are done outside in the name of Christ not against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and some things are done inside on the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> part which are against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>18. What shall we say of what is also wonderful, that he who carefully observes may find that it is possible that certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, without violating <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity, may yet teach what is useless, as Peter wished to compel the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to observe Jewish customs, <span class="stiki" id="note141399"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> as Cyprian himself would force <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anew? Whence the apostle says to such good members, who are rooted in charity, and yet walk not rightly in some points, "If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you;" <span class="stiki" id="note141400"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> and that some again, though devoid of charity, may teach something wholesome? Of whom the Lord says, "The <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a> sit in <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> seat: all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say and do not." <span class="stiki" id="note141401"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse2">Matthew&nbsp;23:2-3</a></span> Whence the apostle also says of those <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and malicious ones who yet preach <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> through Christ, "Whether in pretense, or in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, let Christ be preached."  Wherefore, both within and without, the waywardness of man is to be corrected, but the divine <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> and utterances are not to be attributed to men. He is not, therefore, a "patron of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>" who refuses to attribute to them what he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not to belong to them, even though it be found among them. We do not grant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to be theirs; but we recognize His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizes," <span class="stiki" id="note141403"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> wheresoever we find it. But if "the treacherous and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> man" continue in his treachery and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, he receives no "remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> either without" or within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; or if, by the power of the sacrament, he receives it for the moment, the same force operates both without and within, as the power of the name of Christ used to work the expulsion of devils even without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>19. But he urges that "we find that the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in all their epistles, execrated and abhorred the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, so as to say that 'their word does spread as a canker.'"  What then? Does not <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> also show that those who said, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die," were corrupters of good manners by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications, adding immediately afterwards, "Evil communications corrupt good manners;" and yet he intimated that these were within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when he says, "How say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?"  But when does he fail to express his abhorrence of the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>? Or could anything be said in stronger terms, than that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> should be called <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, as the same apostle declared? <span class="stiki" id="note141406"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;5:5</a></span> Nor did Cyprian understand his language otherwise, inserting it when need required in his letters; though he confesses that in his time there were in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> men of an ordinary type, but <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> and <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>, and these found not among the masses, but among the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. And yet I should be willing to understand that those of whom the apostle says, "Their word does spread as a canker," were without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but Cyprian himself will not allow me. For, when showing, in his letter to Antonianus,  that no man ought to sever himself from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> before the time of the final separation of the just and <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, merely because of the admixture of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when he makes it manifest how <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> he was, and deserving of the illustrious <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> which he won, he says, "What swelling of arrogance it is, what forgetfulness of humility and gentleness, that any one should dare or <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that he can do what the Lord did not grant even to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>&mdash;to think that he can distinguish the tares from the wheat, or, as if it were granted to him to carry the fan and purge the floor, to endeavor to separate the chaff from the grain! And whereas the apostle says, 'But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth,' <span class="stiki" id="note141408"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:20</a></span> that he should seem to choose those of gold and of silver, and despise and cast away and condemn those of wood and of earth, when really the vessels of wood are only to be burned in the day of the Lord by the burning of the divine conflagration, and those of earth are to be broken by Him to whom the 'rod of iron  has been given.'"  By this argument, therefore, against those who, under the pretext of avoiding the society of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, had severed themselves from the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Cyprian shows that by the great house of which the apostle spoke, in which there were not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, he understood nothing else but the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in which there should be good and bad, till at the last day it should be cleansed as a threshing-floor by the winnowing-fan. And if this be so, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, that is, in the great house itself, there were vessels to dishonor, whose word did spread like a canker. For the apostle, speaking of them, taught as follows: "And their word," he says, "will spread as does a canker; of whom is Hymen&aelig;us and Philetus; who concerning the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of some. Nevertheless the foundation of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> stands sure, having this seal, The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth." <span class="stiki" id="note141411"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse17">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:17-20</a></span> If, therefore, they whose words did spread as does a canker were as it were vessels to dishonor in the great house, and by that "great house" Cyprian understands the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, surely it cannot be that their canker polluted the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Accordingly, neither without, any more than within, can any one who is of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> party, either in himself or in any other person, stain the sacrament which is of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. It is not, therefore, the case that "the word which spreads as a canker to the ears of those who hear it gives remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;"  but when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is given in the words of the gospel, however great be the perverseness of understanding on the part either of him through whom, or of him to whom it is given, the sacrament itself is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in itself on account of Him whose sacrament it is. And if any one, receiving it at the hands of a misguided man, yet does not receive the perversity of the minister, but only the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a>, being closely bound to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope and charity, he receives remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>&mdash;not by the words which do eat as does a canker, but by the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of the gospel flowing from a heavenly source. But if the recipient himself be misguided, on the one hand, what is given is of no avail for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the misguided man; and yet, on the other hand, that which is received remains <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in the recipient, and is not renewed to him if he be brought to the right way.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>20. There is therefore "no fellowship between righteousness and unrighteousness,"  not only without, but also within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for "the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His," and "Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity." There is also "no communion between light and darkness," <span class="stiki" id="note141414"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse14">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:14</a></span> not only without, but also within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for "he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is still in darkness." <span class="stiki" id="note141415"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:9</a></span> And they at any rate <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, who, preaching Christ of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and malicious strife, supposed that they added affliction to his bonds; <span class="stiki" id="note141416"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;1:15-16</a></span> and yet the same Cyprian understands these still to have been within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Since, therefore, "neither darkness can enlighten, nor unrighteousness justify,"  as Cyprian again says, I ask, how could those men <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> within the very Church herself? I ask, how could those vessels which the large house contains not to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, but to dishonor, administer what is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> for the sanctifying of men within the great house itself, unless because that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the sacrament cannot be polluted even by the unclean, either when it is given at their hands, or when it is received by those who in heart and life are not changed for the better? Of whom, as situated within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Cyprian himself says, "Renouncing the world in word only, and not in deed." </p>

<p>21. There are therefore also within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> "enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whose hearts the spirit of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> has possessed;" and yet they, "deal with spiritual and divine things,"  which cannot profit for their <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> so long as they remain such as they are; and yet neither can they pollute them by their own uncleanness. With regard to what he says, therefore, "that they have no part given them in the saving <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who, scattering and fighting against the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are called adversaries by Christ Himself, and antichrists by His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>,  this must be received under the consideration that there are men of this kind both within and without. But the separation of those that are within from the perfection and unity of the dove is not only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> in the case of some men to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but even in the case of some to their fellow-men; for, by regarding their openly abandoned life and confirmed <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and comparing it with the rules of God's commandments, they understand to what a multitude of tares and chaff, situated now some within and some without, but destined to be most manifestly separated at the last day, the Lord will then say, "Depart from me, you that work iniquity," <span class="stiki" id="note141421"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;7:23</a></span> and "Depart into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141422"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> </p>

<p>22. But we must not despair of the conversion of any man, whether situated within or without, so long as "the goodness of God leads him to repentance," <span class="stiki" id="note141423"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;2:4</a></span> and "visits their transgressions with the rod, and their inquiry with stripes." For in this way "He does not utterly take from them His loving-kindness,"  if they will themselves sometimes "<a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, pleasing God."  But as the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man "that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved," <span class="stiki" id="note141426"><a href="../bible/mat024.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;24:13</a></span> so the bad man, whether within or without, who shall persevere in his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> to the end, shall not be saved. Nor do we say that "all, wheresoever and howsoever <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, obtain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>,"  if by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is understood the actual <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is conferred by the celebration of the sacrament; but many fail to obtain this <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> even within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, although it is clear that they possess the sacrament, which is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in itself. Well, therefore, does the Lord warn us in the gospel that we should not company with ill-advisers, <span class="stiki" id="note141428"><a href="../bible/mar013.htm#verse21">Mark&nbsp;13:21</a></span> who walk under the pretence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> name; but these are found both within and without, as, in fact, they do not proceed without unless they have first been ill-disposed within. And we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that the apostle said of the vessels placed in the great house, "If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, sanctified, and meet for the Master's use, and prepared unto every good work." <span class="stiki" id="note141429"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse21">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:21</a></span> But in what manner each man ought to purge himself from these he shows a little above, saying, "Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity," <span class="stiki" id="note141430"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:19</a></span> that he may not in the last day, with the chaff, whether with that which has already been driven from the threshing-floor, or with that which is to be separated at the last, hear the command, "Depart from me, you that work iniquity." <span class="stiki" id="note141431"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;7:23</a></span> Whence it appears, indeed, as Cyprian says, that "we are not at once to admit and adopt whatsoever is professed in the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but only what is done in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>."  But it is not an action done in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of Christ that men should "seize on estates by fraudulent pretenses, and increase their gains by accumulated <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usury</a>,"  or that they should "renounce the world in word only;"  and yet, that all this is done within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, Cyprian himself bears sufficient testimony.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p>23. To go on to the point which he pursues at great length, that "they who <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Father of Christ cannot be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,"  since it is clear that they <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> through <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> (for he who comes to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ will not openly <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but he is led to <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheme</a> by holding a view contrary to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about the Father of Christ), we have already shown at sufficient length that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the words of the gospel, is not affected by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of any man, whether ministrant or recipient, whether he hold views contrary to the revelation of divine teaching on the subject of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. For many carnal and natural men are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> even within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the apostle expressly says: "The natural man receives not the things of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note141436"><a href="../bible/1co002.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> and after they had received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he says that they "are yet carnal." <span class="stiki" id="note141437"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:3</a></span> But according to it carnal sense, a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> given up to fleshly appetites cannot entertain but fleshly wisdom about God. Wherefore many, progressing after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and especially those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in infancy or early youth, in proportion as their <a href="../cathen/08066a.htm">intellect</a> becomes clearer and brighter, while "the inward man is renewed day by day," <span class="stiki" id="note141438"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> throw away their former opinions which they held about God while they were mocked with vain imaginings, with scorn and horror and confession of their mistake. And yet they are not therefore considered not to have received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or to have received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of a kind corresponding to their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; but in them both the perfection of the sacrament is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a> and the delusion of their mind is corrected, even though it had become inveterate through long confirmation, or been, perhaps, maintained in many controversies. Wherefore even the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, who is manifestly without, if he has there received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as ordained in the gospel, has certainly not received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of a kind corresponding to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> which blinds him. And therefore, in returning into the way of wisdom he perceives that he ought to relinquish what he has held amiss, he must not at the same time give up the good which he had received; nor because his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> is to be condemned, is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ in him to be therefore extinguished. For it is already sufficiently clear, from the case of those who happen to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with false views about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the sacrament is to be distinguished from the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of him who believes amiss, although both may be found in the same man. And therefore, when any one grounded in any <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, even outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, has yet been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sacrament, when he is restored to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> cannot take the place of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> takes the place of a false one, because a thing cannot take the place of itself, since neither can it give place. Heretics therefore join the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to this end, that what they have <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of themselves may be corrected, not that what they have good of God should be repeated.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>24. Some one says, Does it then make no difference, if two men, rooted in like <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without change of life or heart, one without, the other within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? I acknowledge that there is a difference. For he is worse who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without, in addition to his other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash;not because of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, however, but because he is without; for the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of division is in itself far from insignificant or trivial. Yet the difference exists only if he who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within has desired to be within not for the sake of any earthly or temporal advantage, but because he has preferred the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> spread throughout the world to the divisions of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; otherwise he too must be considered among those who are without. Let us therefore put the two cases in this way. Let us suppose that the one, for the sake of argument, held the same opinions as Photinus  about Christ, and was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in his <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> outside the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and that another held the same opinion but was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, believing that his view was really the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. I consider him as not yet a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, unless, when the doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made clear to him, he chooses to resist it, and prefers that which he already holds; and till this is the case, it is clear that he who was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside is the worse. And so in the one case erroneous opinion alone, in the other the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> also, requires correction; but in neither of them is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the sacrament to be repeated. But if any one holds the same view as the first, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it is only in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> severed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that such a view is taught or learned, but yet for the sake of some temporal emolument has desired to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, or, having been already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in it, is unwilling on account of the said emolument to secede from it, he is not only to be considered as seceding, but his offense is aggravated, in so far as to the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and the division of unity he adds the deceit of hypocrisy. Wherefore the depravity of each man, in proportion as it is more dangerous and wanting in straightforwardness, must be corrected with the more earnestness and energy; and yet, if he has anything that is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in him, especially if it be not of himself, but from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we ought not to think it of no value because of his depravity, or to be blamed like it, or to be ascribed to it, rather than to His bountiful goodness, who even to a <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> that plays the harlot, and goes after her lovers, yet gives His bread, and His wine, and His oil, and other food or ornaments, which are neither from herself nor from her lovers, but from Him who in compassion for her is even desirous to warn her to whom she should return. <span class="stiki" id="note141440"><a href="../bible/hos002.htm#verse5">Hosea&nbsp;2:5-8</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p>25. "Can the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>," says Cyprian, "be greater or better than confession? Than <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>? That a man should confess Christ before men, and be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in his own blood? And yet," he goes on to say, "neither does this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> profit the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, even though for confessing Christ he be <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."  This is most <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for, by being <a href="../cathen/12565a.htm">put to death</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> not to have had charity, of which the apostle says, "Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing." <span class="stiki" id="note141442"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:3</a></span> But if <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is of no avail for this reason, because it has not charity, neither does it profit those who, as <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> says, and Cyprian further sets forth, are living within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without charity in <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>; and yet they can both receive and transmit <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. "Salvation," he says, "is not without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."  Who says that it is? And therefore, whatever men have that belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it profits them nothing towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But it is one thing not to have, another to have so as to be of no use. He who has not must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> that he may have; but he who has to no avail must be corrected, that what he has may profit him. Nor is the water in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> "adulterous,"  because neither is the creature itself which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, nor is fault to be found with the words of the gospel in the mouths of any who are astray; but the fault is theirs in whom there is an adulterous spirit, even though it may receive the adornment of the sacrament from a lawful spouse. Baptism therefore can "be common to us, and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,"  just as the gospel can be common to us, whatever difference there may be between our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>&mdash;whether they think otherwise than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> about the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, or the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; or, being cut away from unity, do not gather with Christ, but scatter abroad, <span class="stiki" id="note141446"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> &mdash; seeing that the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> can be common to us, if we are the wheat of the Lord, with the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and with <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and drunkards, and other pestilent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of the same sort, of whom it is said, "They shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141447"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> and yet the <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> by which they are separated from the kingdom of God are not shared by us.</p>

<p>26. Nor indeed, is it of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> alone that the apostle says "that they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." But it may be worth while to look for a moment at the things which he groups together. "The works of the flesh," he says "are manifest, which are these; fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, variance, emulations, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, strife, seditions, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, envyings, murders, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141448"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19-21</a></span> Let us suppose some one, therefore, chaste, continent, free from <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, no idolater, hospitable, charitable to the needy, no man's enemy, not contentious, patient, quiet, jealous of none, envying none, sober, frugal, but a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; it is of course clear to all that for this one fault only, that he is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, he will fail to inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Let us suppose another, a fornicator, unclean, lascivious, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, or even more openly given to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, a student of <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, a lover of strife and contention, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, hot-tempered, seditious, jealous, drunken, and a reveller, but a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>; can it be that for this sole merit, that he is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, he will inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, though his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> are of the kind of which the apostle thus concludes: "Of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" If we say this, we lead ourselves astray. For the word of God does not lead us astray, which is neither silent, nor lenient, nor deceptive through any flattery. Indeed, it speaks to the same effect elsewhere: "For this ye <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, which is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Let no man deceive you with vain words." <span class="stiki" id="note141449"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;5:5-6</a></span> We have no reason, therefore, to complain of the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.

<p>27. Let us therefore not flatter the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> who is hemmed in with all these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, nor venture, merely because he is a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, to promise him the impunity which <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture does not promise  him; nor, if he has any one of the faults above mentioned, ought we to promise him a partnership in that heavenly land. For, in writing to the Corinthians, the apostle enumerates the several <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, under each of which it is implicitly understood that it shall not inherit the kingdom of God: "Be not deceived," he says: "neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, nor thieves, nor <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141450"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:9-10</a></span> He does not say, those who possess all these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> together shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>; but neither these nor those: so that, as each is named, you may understand that no one of them shall inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. As, therefore, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> shall not possess the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. Nor can we indeed <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the punishments themselves, with which they shall be tortured who do not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>, will vary in proportion to the difference of their offenses, and that some will be more severe than others; so that in the <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">eternal fire</a> itself there will be different tortures in the punishments, corresponding to the different weights of guilt. For indeed it was not idly that the Lord said, "It shall be more tolerable for the land of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in the day of judgment than for you." <span class="stiki" id="note141451"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;11:24</a></span> But yet, so far as failing to inherit the kingdom of God is concerned, it is just as certain, if you choose any one of the less heinous of these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, as if you choose more than one, or some one which you saw was more atrocious; and because those will inherit the kingdom of God whom the Judge shall set on His right hand, and for those who shall not be found worthy to be set at the right hand nothing will remain but to be at the left, no other announcement is left for them to hear like goats from the mouth of the Shepherd, except, "Depart into <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">everlasting fire</a>, prepared for the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note141452"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse41">Matthew&nbsp;25:41</a></span> though in that fire, as I said before, it may be that different punishments will be awarded corresponding to the difference of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.</h2>

<p>28. But on the question whether we ought to prefer a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> of the most abandoned character to a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> in whose life, except that he is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, men can find nothing to blame, I do not venture to give a hasty judgment. But if any one says, because he is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, he cannot be this only without other <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> also following&mdash;for he is carnal and natural, and therefore must be also <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, and hot-tempered, and jealous, and hostile to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself, and utterly estranged from it&mdash;let him fairly understand, that of those other faults of which he is supposed to have chosen some one less flagrant, a single one cannot exist by itself in any man, because he in turn is carnal and natural; as, to take the case of <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, which people have now become accustomed to talk of not only without horror, but with some degree of merriment, can it possibly exist alone in any one in whom it is found? For what drunkard is not also contentious, and hot-tempered, and jealous, and at variance with all soundness of counsel, and at grievous enmity with those who rebuke him? Further, it is not easy for him to avoid being a fornicator and adulterer, though he may be no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; just as a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> may be no drunkard, nor adulterer, nor fornicator, nor lascivious, nor a lover of money, or given to <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, and cannot well be all these together. Nor indeed is any one <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a> followed by all the rest. Supposing, therefore, two men,&mdash; one a <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> with all these <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a>, the other a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> free from all from which a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> can be free&mdash;although they do not both contend against the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and yet each lives contrary to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and each is deceived by a vain hope, and each is far removed from charity of spirit, and therefore each is severed from connection with the body of the one dove; why do we recognise in one of them the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and not in the other, as though it belonged to this or that man, while really it is the same in both, and belongs to God alone, and is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> even in the worst of men? And if of the men who have it, one is worse than another, it does not follow that the sacrament which they have is worse in the one than in the other, seeing that neither in the case of two bad <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>, if one be worse than the other, does he possess a worse <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, nor, if one of them be good and another bad, is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> bad in the bad one and good in the good one; but it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in both. Just as the light of the sun, or even of a lamp, is certainly not less brilliant when displayed to bad eyes than when seen by better ones; but it is the same in the case of both, although it either cheers or hurts them differently according to the difference of their powers.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.</h2>

<p>29. With regard to the objection brought against Cyprian, that the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> who were seized in <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, and slain for Christ's name's sake, received a crown even without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, I do not quite see what it has to do with the matter, unless, indeed, they urged that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> could much more be admitted with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to Christ's kingdom, to which <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> were admitted without it, since He Himself has said, "Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141453"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> Now, in this matter I do not hesitate for a moment to place the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> catechumen, who is burning with <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, before the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>; nor yet do we thereby do dishonor to the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which the latter has already received, the former not as yet; nor do we consider that the sacrament of the catechumen  is to be preferred to the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, when we acknowledge that some <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> are better and more faithful than some <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>. For the centurion Cornelius, before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, was better than Simon, who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For Cornelius, even before his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, was filled with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; <span class="stiki" id="note141455"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse44">Acts&nbsp;10:44</a></span> Simon, even after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, was puffed up with an unclean spirit.  Cornelius, however, would have been convicted of contempt for so <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> a sacrament, if, even after he had received the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, he had refused to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But when he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he received in no wise a better sacrament than Simon; but the different merits of the men were made manifest under the equal <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the same sacrament&mdash; so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is it that the good or ill deserving of the recipient does not increase or diminish the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. But as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is wanting to a good catechumen to his receiving the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, so <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion is wanting to a bad man though <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For He who said, "Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>," said also Himself, "unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall in no case enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141457"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;5:20</a></span> For that the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/03430b.htm">catechumens</a> might not feel secure, it is written, "Unless a man be born again of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." And again, that the unrighteousness of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> might not feel secure because they had received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, it is written, "Unless your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, you shall in no case enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." The one were too little without the other; the two make perfect the heir of that inheritance. As, then, we ought not to depreciate a man's righteousness, which begins to exist before he is joined to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as the righteousness of Cornelius began to exist before he was in the body of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> men,&mdash; which righteousness was not thought worthless, or the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> would not have said to him, "Your <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> and your <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a> have come up as a memorial before <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;" nor did it yet suffice for his obtaining the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, or he would not have been told to send to Peter, <span class="stiki" id="note141458"><a href="../bible/act010.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;10:4-5</a></span> &mdash; so neither ought we to depreciate the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, even though it has been received outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But since it is of no avail for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unless he who has <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> indeed in full perfection be incorporated into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, correcting also his own depravity, let us therefore correct the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that we may recognize what in them is not their own but Christ's.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.</h2>

<p>30. That the place of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is sometimes supplied by <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> is supported by an argument by no means trivial, which the blessed Cyprian adduces  from the thief, to whom, though he was not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, it was yet said, "Today shall you be with me in Paradise." <span class="stiki" id="note141460"><a href="../bible/luk023.htm#verse43">Luke&nbsp;23:43</a></span> On considering which, again and again, I find that not only <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> for the sake of Christ may supply what was wanting of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but also <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and conversion of heart, if recourse may not be had to the celebration of the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for want of time.  For neither was that thief crucified for the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but as the reward of his own <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; nor did he suffer because he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, but he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> while suffering. It was shown, therefore, in the case of that thief, how great is the power, even without the visible sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, of what the apostle says, "With the heart man <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a> unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141462"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse10">Romans&nbsp;10:10</a></span> But the want is supplied invisibly only when the administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is prevented, not by contempt for religion, but by the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of the moment. For much more in the case of Cornelius and his friends, than in the case of that robber, might it seem superfluous that they should also be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, seeing that in them the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, which, according to the testimony  of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, was received by other men only after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, had made itself manifest by every unmistakable sign appropriate to those times when they spoke with tongues. Yet they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and for this action we have the authority of an apostle as the warrant. So far ought all of us to be from being induced by any imperfection in the inner man, if it so happen that before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> a person has advanced, through the workings of a <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> heart, to spiritual understanding, to despise a sacrament which is applied to the body by the hands of the minister, but which is God's own means for working spiritually a man's dedication to Himself. Nor do I conceive that the function of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> was assigned to John, so that it should be called John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, for any other reason except that the Lord Himself, who had appointed it, in not disdaining to receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of His servant, <span class="stiki" id="note141463"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse6">Matthew&nbsp;3:6,&nbsp;13</a></span> might consecrate the path of humility, and show most plainly by such an action how high a value was to be placed on His own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, with which He Himself was afterwards to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. For He saw, like an excellent physician of <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, that overweening <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> would be found in some, who, having made such progress in the understanding of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and in uprightness of character that they would not hesitate to place themselves, both in life and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, above many that were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, would think it was unnecessary for them to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, since they felt that they had attained a frame of mind to which many that were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> were still only endeavoring to raise themselves.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.</h2>

<p>31. But what is the precise value of the sanctification of the sacrament (which that thief did not receive, not from any want of will on his part, but because it was unavoidably omitted) and what is the effect on a man of its material application, it is not easy to say. Still, had it not been of the greatest value, the Lord would not have received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of a servant. But since we must look at it in itself, without entering upon the question of the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of the recipient, which it is intended to work, it shows clearly enough that both in the bad, and in those who renounce the world in word and not in deed, it is itself complete, though they cannot receive <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unless they amend their lives. But as in the thief, to whom the material administration of the sacrament was necessarily wanting, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> was complete, because it was spiritually present through his <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, so, when the sacrament itself is present, <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is complete, if what the thief possessed be unavoidably wanting. And this is the firm tradition of the universal Church, in respect of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of infants, who certainly are as yet unable "with the heart to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> unto righteousness, and with the mouth to make confession unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>," as the thief could do; nay, who even, by crying and moaning when the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> is performed upon them, raise their voices in opposition to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> words, and yet no <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> will say that they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> to no purpose.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.</h2>

<p>32. And if any one seek for divine authority in this matter, though what is held by the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that not as instituted by Councils, but as a matter of invariable custom, is rightly held to have been handed down by <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm"apostolic/a> authority, still we can form a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conjecture of the value of the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the case of infants, from the parallel of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, which was received by God's earlier people, and before receiving which <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> was justified, as Cornelius also was enriched with the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> before he was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Yet the apostle says of <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> himself, that "he received the sign of <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a>, a seal of the righteousness of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," having already <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in his heart, so that "it was counted unto him for righteousness."  Why, therefore, was it commanded him that he should circumcise every male child in order on the eighth day, <span class="stiki" id="note141465"><a href="../bible/gen017.htm#verse9">Genesis&nbsp;17:9-14</a></span> though it could not yet <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with the heart, that it should be counted unto it for righteousness, because the sacrament in itself was of great avail? And this was made manifest by the message of an <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> in the case of <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses'</a> son; for when he was carried by his mother, being yet uncircumcised, it was required, by manifest present peril, that he should be <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note141466"><a href="../bible/exo004.htm#verse24">Exodus&nbsp;4:24-26</a></span> and when this was done, the danger of death was removed. As therefore in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a> the justification of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> came first, and <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> was added afterwards as the seal of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; so in Cornelius the spiritual sanctification came first in the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, and the sacrament of regeneration was added afterwards in the laver of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And as in Isaac, who was <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcised</a> on the eighth day after his birth, the seal of this righteousness of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> was given first, and afterwards, as he imitated the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of his father, the righteousness itself followed as he grew up, of which the seal had been given before when he was an infant; so in infants, who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, the sacrament of regeneration is given first, and if they maintain a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, conversion also in the heart will follow, of which the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> sign had gone before in the outward body. And as in the thief the gracious goodness of the Almighty supplied what had been wanting in the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because it had been missing not from <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> or contempt, but from want of opportunity; so in infants who die <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, we must <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the Almighty supplies the want, that, not from perversity of will, but from insufficiency of age, they can neither <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> with the heart unto righteousness, nor make confession with the mouth unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Therefore, when others take the vows for them, that the celebration of the sacrament may be complete in their behalf, it is unquestionably of avail for their dedication to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, because they cannot answer for themselves. But if another were to answer for one who could answer for himself, it would not be of the same avail. In accordance with which rule, we find in the gospel what strikes every one as natural when he reads it, "He is of age, he shall speak for himself." <span class="stiki" id="note141467"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse21">John&nbsp;9:21</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 25.</h2>

<p>33. By all these considerations it is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is one thing, the conversion of the heart another; but that man's <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is made complete through the two together. Nor are we to suppose that, if one of these be wanting, it necessarily follows that the other is wanting also; because the sacrament may exist in the infant without the conversion of the heart; and this was found to be possible without the sacrament in the case of the thief, God in either case filling up what was involuntarily wanting. But when either of these requisites is wanting intentionally, then the man is responsible for the omission. And <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> may exist when the conversion of the heart is wanting; but, with respect to such conversion, it may indeed be found when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> has not been received, but never when it has been despised. Nor can there be said in any way to be a turning of the heart to God when the sacrament of God is treated with contempt. Therefore we are right in censuring, <a href="../cathen/01455e.htm">anathematizing</a>, abhorring, and abominating the perversity of heart shown by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; yet it does not follow that they have not the sacrament of the gospel, because they have not what makes it of avail. Wherefore, when they come to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and by penitence seek remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, we are not flattering or deceiving them, when we instruct them by heavenly discipline for the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, correcting and reforming in them their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> and perverseness, to the intent that we may by no means do <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> to what is sound in them, nor, because of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> fault, declare that anything which he may have in him from God is either valueless or faulty.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.</h2>

<p>34. A few things still remain to be noticed in the epistle to Jubaianus; but since these will raise the question both of the past custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, which is wont to excite no small <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in those who pay slight attention to a matter which is sufficiently obvious, seeing that those who had received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John were commanded by the apostle to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again <span class="stiki" id="note141468"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;19:3-5</a></span> they are not to be treated in a hasty manner, and had better be reserved for another book, that the dimensions of this may not be inconveniently large.</p>
