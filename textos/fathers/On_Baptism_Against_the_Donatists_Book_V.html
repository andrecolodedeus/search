<h1>On Baptism, Against the Donatists (Book V)</h1>

<p><strong>He examines the last part of the epistle of Cyprian to Jubaianus, together with his epistle to Quintus, the letter of the African synod to the Numidian bishops, and Cyprian's epistle to Pompeius.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. We have the testimony of the blessed Cyprian, that the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is at present retained, when men coming from the side of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics, if they have received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> as <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the words of the gospel, are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh. For he himself proposed to himself the question, and that as coming from the mouth of brethren either seeking the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or contending for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For in the course of the arguments by which he wished to show that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, which we have sufficiently considered for our present purpose in the former books, he says: "But some will say, What then will become of those who in times past, coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, were admitted without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>?"  In this question is involved the shipwreck of the whole <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, with whom our contest is on this point. For if those had not really <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who were thus received on coming from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were still upon them, then, when such men were admitted to communion, either by those who came before Cyprian or by Cyprian himself, we must acknowledge that one of two things occurred&mdash;either that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> perished then and there from the pollution of communion with such men, or that any one abiding in unity is not injured by even the notorious <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of other men. But since they cannot say that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> then perished through the contamination arising from communion with those who, as Cyprian says, were admitted into it without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash; for otherwise they cannot maintain the validity of their own origin if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> then perished, seeing that the list of consuls proves that more than forty years elapsed between the <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a> of Cyprian and the burning of the sacred books,  from which they took occasion to make a <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, spreading abroad the smoke of their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>&mdash;it therefore is left for them to acknowledge that the unity of Christ is not polluted by any such communion, even with <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> offenders. And, after this confession, they will be unable to discover any reason which will justify them in maintaining that they were bound to separate from the churches of the whole world, which, as we read, were equally founded by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, seeing that, while the others could not have perished from any admixture of offenders, of whatsoever kind, they, though they would not have perished if they had remained in unity with them, brought destruction on themselves in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, by separating themselves from their brethren, and breaking the bond of peace. For the sacrilege of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is most clearly evident in them, if they had no sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for separation. And it is clear that there was no sufficient <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for separation, if even the presence of notorious offenders cannot pollute the good while they abide in unity. But that the good, abiding in unity, are not polluted even by notorious offenders, we teach on the testimony of Cyprian, who says that "men in past times, coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, were admitted without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>;" and yet, if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of their sacrilege, which was still upon them, seeing it had not been purged away by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, could not pollute and destroy the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it cannot perish by any infection from <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men. Wherefore, if they allow that Cyprian spoke the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they are convicted of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> on his testimony; if they maintain that he does not speak <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, let them not use his testimony on the question of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>2. But now that we have begun a disputation with a man of peace like Cyprian, let us go on. For when he had brought an objection against himself, which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> was urged by his brethren, "What then will become of those who in times past, coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, were admitted without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? The Lord," he answers, "is able of His mercy to grant indulgence, and not to separate from the gifts of His Church those who, being admitted in all honesty to His Church, have fallen asleep within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."  Well indeed has he assumed that charity can cover the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But if they really had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and this were not rightly perceived by those who thought that they should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> was covered by the charity of unity so long as it contained, not the discord and spirit of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, but merely <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> infirmity, until, as the apostle says, "if they were otherwise minded, the Lord should reveal it to them." <span class="stiki" id="note141472"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> But woe unto those who, being torn asunder from unity by a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> rupture, either rebaptize, if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists with both us and them, or do not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> at all, if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exist in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> only. Whether, therefore, they rebaptize, or fail to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, they are not in the bond of peace; wherefore let them apply a remedy to which they please of these two wounds. But if we admit to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, we are of the number of those who, as Cyprian has assumed, may receive pardon because they preserved unity. But if (as is, I think, already clear from what has been said in the earlier books) <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> can preserve its integrity even amid the perversity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, then even though any in those times did rebaptize, yet without departing from the bond of unity, they might still attain to pardon in virtue of that same <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of peace, through which Cyprian bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that those admitted even without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> might obtain that they should not be separated from the gifts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Further, if it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ does not exist, how much less could the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others hurt those who were fixed in unity, if even men's own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were forgiven when they came to it even without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>! For if, according to Cyprian, the bond of unity is of such efficacy, how could they be hurt by other men's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, who were unwilling to separate themselves from unity, if even the unbaptized, who wished to come to it from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, thereby escaped the destruction due to their own <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>3. But in what Cyprian adds, saying, "Nor yet because men once have erred must there be always <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, since it rather befits wise and God-fearing men gladly and unhesitatingly to follow <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when it is clearly laid before their eyes, than obstinately and persistently to fight for <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> against their brethren and their fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>,"  he is uttering the most perfect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; and the man who resists the manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is opposing himself rather than his neighbors. But, so far as I can judge, it is perfectly clear and certain, from the many arguments which I have already adduced, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ cannot be invalidated even by the perversity of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, when it is given or received among them. But, granting that it is not yet certain, at any rate no one who has considered what has been said, even from a hostile point of view, will assert that the question has been decided the other way. Therefore we are not striving against manifest <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, but either, as I think, we are striving in behalf of what is clearly <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, or, at any rate, as those may hold who think that the question has not yet been solved, we are seeking for the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. And therefore, if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> be other than we think, yet we are receiving those <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> with the same honesty of heart with which those received them whom, Cyprian supposed, in virtue of their cleaving to the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to be capable of pardon. But if the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as is indicated by the many arguments used above, can retain its integrity amid any defect either of life or <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, whether on the part of those who seem to be within, and yet do not belong to the members of the one dove or on the part of those whose severance from her extends to being openly without, then those who sought its repetition in those former days deserved the same pardon for their charity in clinging to unity, which Cyprian thought that those deserved for charity of the same kind whom he <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to have been admitted without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. They therefore who, without any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> (since, as Cyprian himself shows, the bad cannot hurt the good in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>), have cut themselves off from the charity which is shown in this unity, have lost all place of pardon, and while they would incur destruction by the very crime of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, even though they did not rebaptize those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of how bitter punishment are they deserving, who are either endeavoring to give to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> who have it what Cyprian affirms that they themselves have not, or, as is clear from the facts of the case, are bringing as a charge against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> that she has not what even they themselves possess?</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>4. But since now, as I said before, we have begun a disputation with the epistles of Cyprian, I think that I should not seem even to him, if he were present, "to be contending obstinately and persistently in defense of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> against my brethren and my fellow <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>," when he learned the powerful reasons which move us to <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that even among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who are perversely obstinate in their malignant <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ is yet in itself most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and most highly to be reverenced. And seeing that he himself, whose testimony has such weight with us, bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that they were wont in past times to be admitted without a second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, I would have any one, who is induced by Cyprian's arguments to hold it as certain that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh, yet consider that those who, on account of weight of the arguments on the other side, are not as yet persuaded that this should be so, hold the same place as those in past time, who in all honesty admitted men who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> on the simple correction of their individual <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and who were capable of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> with them in virtue of the bond of unity. And let any one, who is led by the past custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and by the subsequent authority of a plenary Council, and by so many powerful <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, and by much evidence from Cyprian himself, and by the clear reasoning of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, to understand that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the words of the gospel, cannot be perverted by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of any man on earth&mdash;let such an one understand, that they who then thought otherwise, but yet preserved their charity, can be saved by the same bond of unity. And herein he should also understand of those who, in the society of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> dispersed throughout the world, could not have been defiled by any tares, by any chaff, so long as they themselves desired to be fruitful grain, and who therefore severed themselves from the same bond of unity without any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for the <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, that at any rate, whichever of the two opinions be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>&mdash;that which Cyprian then held, or that which was maintained by the universal voice of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which Cyprian did not abandon,&mdash; in either case they, having most openly placed themselves outside in the plain sacrilege of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, cannot possibly be saved, and all that they possess of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and of the free gifts of the one legitimate Bridegroom, is of avail, while they continue what they are, for their confusion rather than the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>5. Wherefore, even if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> anxious to correct their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, for the very reason that they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> that they had no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> unless they received it in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, even under these circumstances we should not be bound to yield to their desire for the repetition of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; but rather they should be taught, on the one hand, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, though perfect in itself, could in no way profit their perversity if they would not submit to be corrected; and, on the other hand, that the perfection of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> could not be impaired by their perversity, while refusing to be corrected: and again, that no further perfection is added to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in them because they are submitting to correction; but that, while they themselves are quitting their iniquity, that which was before within them to their destruction is now beginning to be of profit for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For, learning this, they will both recognize the need of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, and will cease to claim as their own what is really Christ's, and will not confound the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, although existing in themselves, with their own individual <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<p>6. To this we may add a further reason, that men, by a sort of hidden inspiration from heaven, shrink from any one who for the second time receives <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which he had already received in any quarter whatsoever, insomuch that the very <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> themselves, when their arguments start with that subject, rub their forehead in perplexity, and almost all their <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laity</a>, even those who have grown old in their body, and have conceived an obstinate animosity against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, confess that this one point in their system displeases them; and many who, for the sake of gaining some secular advantage, or avoiding some disadvantage, wish to secede to them, strive with many secret efforts that they may have granted to them, as a peculiar and individual privilege, that they should not be rebaptized; and some, who are led to place credence in their other vain delusions and false accusations against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, are recalled to unity by this one consideration, that they are unwilling to associate with them lest they should be compelled to be rebaptized. And the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a>, through <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of this feeling, which has so thorough possession of all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men's</a> hearts, have consented to acknowledge the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which was conferred among the followers of Maximianus, whom they had condemned, and so to cut short their own tongues and close their mouths, in preference to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> again so many men of the people of Musti, and Assur&aelig;, and other districts, whom they received with Felicianus and Pr&aelig;textatus, and the others who had been condemned by them and afterwards returned to them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>7. For when this is done occasionally in the case of individuals, at great intervals of time and space, the enormity of the deed is not equally felt; but if all were suddenly to be brought together who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in course of time by the aforesaid followers of Maximianus, either under pressure of the peril of death or at their <a href="../cathen/05224d.htm">Easter</a> solemnities, and it were told them that they must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, because what they had already received in the sacrilege of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> was null and void, they might indeed say what obstinate perseverance in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> would compel them to say, that they might hide the rigor and iciness of their hardness under any kind of false shade of consistency against the warmth of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. But in fact, because the party of Maximianus could not bear this, and because the very men who would have to enforce it could not endure what must needs have been done in the case of so many men at once, especially as those very men would be rebaptizing them in the party of Primianus who had already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> them in the party of Maximianus, for these reasons their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was received, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> was cut short. And this course they would certainly not have chosen to adopt, had they not thought that more harm would have been done to their <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> by the offense men would have taken at the repetition of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, than by the <a href="../cathen/12776c.htm">reputation</a> lost in abandoning their defense. And this I would not say with any idea that we ought to be restrained by consideration of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> feelings, if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> compelled those who came from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh. But because the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyprian says, "that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> might have been all the more impelled to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of coming over, if only they were to be rebaptized in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>,"  on this account I have wished to place on record the intensity of the repugnance to this act which is seated deeply in the heart of nearly every one&mdash;a repugnance which I can <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> was inspired by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> Himself, that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> might be fortified by the instinct of repugnance against any possible arguments which the weak cannot dispel.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>8. Truly, when I look at the actual words of Cyprian, I am warned to say some things which are very necessary for the solution of this question. "For if they were to see," he says, "that it was settled and established by our formal decision and vote, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> with which they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is considered just and lawful, they will think that they are in just and lawful possession of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also, and all its other gifts."  He does not say "that they will think they are in possession," but "in just and lawful possession of the gifts of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." But we say that we cannot allow that they are in just and lawful possession of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. That they are in possession of it we cannot deny, when we recognize the sacrament of the Lord in the words of the gospel. They have therefore lawful <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but they do not have it lawfully. For whosoever has it both in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, and living worthily of it, both has lawful <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and has it lawfully; but whosoever has it either within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, as chaff mixed with the wheat, or outside, as chaff carried away by the wind, has indeed lawful <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but not lawfully. For he has it as he uses it. But the man does not use it lawfully who uses it against the law,&mdash; which every one does, who, being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, yet leads an abandoned life, whether inside or without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>9. Wherefore, as the apostle said of the law, "The law is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if a man use it lawfully," <span class="stiki" id="note141476"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:8</a></span> so we may fairly say of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, Baptism is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, if a man use it lawfully. And as they who used the law unlawfully could not in that case <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that it should not be in itself good, or make it null and void, so any one who uses <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> unlawfully, either because he lives in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, or because he lives the worst of lives, yet cannot <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be otherwise than good, or altogether null and void. And so, when he is converted either to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, or to a mode of living worthy of so great a sacrament, he begins to have not another and a lawful <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but that same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in a lawful manner. Nor does the remission of irrevocable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> follow on <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, unless a man not only have lawful <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but have it lawfully; and yet it does not follow that if a man have it not lawfully, so that his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are either not remitted, or, being remitted, are brought on him again, therefore the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> person either bad or null and void. For as Judas, to whom the Lord gave a morsel, gave a place within himself of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, not by receiving  what was bad, but by receiving it badly, <span class="stiki" id="note141477"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;13:27</a></span> so each person, on receiving the sacrament of the Lord, does not <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that it is bad because he is bad himself, or that he has received nothing because he has not received it to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For it was none the less the body of the Lord and the blood of the Lord, even in those to whom the apostle said, "He that eats unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself." <span class="stiki" id="note141478"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:29</a></span> Let the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> therefore seek in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> not what they have, but what they have not&mdash;that is, the end of the commandment, without which many <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> things may be possessed, but they cannot profit. "Now, the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned." <span class="stiki" id="note141479"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> Let them therefore hasten to the unity and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not that they may have the sacrament of washing, if they have been already bathed in it, although in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, but that they may have it to their health.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>10. Now we must see what is said of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John. For "we read in the Acts of the Apostles, that those who had already been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John were yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>,"  simply because the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was not the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> allowed by Christ to John, so as to be called especially John's <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; as the same John says, "A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven." <span class="stiki" id="note141481"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;3:27</a></span> And that he might not possibly seem to receive this from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father in such wise as not to receive it from the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, speaking presently of Christ Himself, he says, "Of His fullness have all we received." <span class="stiki" id="note141482"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse16">John&nbsp;1:16</a></span> But by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of a certain dispensation John received this, which was to last not for long, but only long enough to prepare for the Lord the way in which he must needs be the forerunner. And as our Lord was presently to enter on this way with all humility, and to lead those who humbly followed Him to perfection, as He washed the feet of His servants, <span class="stiki" id="note141483"><a href="../bible/joh013.htm#verse4">John&nbsp;13:4-5</a></span> so was He willing to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of a servant. <span class="stiki" id="note141484"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse13">Matthew&nbsp;3:13</a></span> For as He set Himself to minister to the feet of those whose guide He was Himself, so He submitted Himself to the gift of John which He Himself had given, that all might understand what <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> arrogance they would show in despising the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they ought each of them to receive from the Lord, when the Lord Himself accepted what He Himself had bestowed upon a servant, that he might give it as his own; and that when John, than whom no greater had arisen among them that are born of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note141485"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;11:11</a></span> bore such testimony to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, as to confess that he was not worthy to unloose the latchet of His shoe, <span class="stiki" id="note141486"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;1:27</a></span> Christ might both, by receiving his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, be found to be the humblest among <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, and, by taking away the place for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, be <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> to be the most high <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, at once the teacher of humility and the giver of exaltation.</p>

<p>11. For to none of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>, to no one at all in <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, do we read that it was granted to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the water of repentance for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as it was granted to John; that, causing the hearts of the people to hang upon him through this marvellous <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, he might prepare in them the way for Him whom he declared to be so infinitely greater than himself. But the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> cleanses His Church by such a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that on receiving it no other is required; while John gave a first washing with such a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that on receiving it there was further need of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the Lord,&mdash; not that the first <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be repeated, but that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, for whom he was preparing the way, might be further bestowed on those who had received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John. For if Christ's humility were not to be commended to our notice, neither would there be any need of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John; again, if the end were in John, after his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> there would be no need of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But because "Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believes</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141487"><a href="../bible/rom010.htm#verse4">Romans&nbsp;10:4</a></span> it was shown by John to whom men should go, and in whom, when they had reached Him, they should rest. The same, John, therefore, set forth both the exalted nature of the Lord, when he placed Him far before himself, and His humility, when he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Him as the lowest of the people. But if John had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Christ alone, he would be thought to have been the dispenser of a better <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in that with which Christ alone was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, than the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ with which <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and again, if all ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> first with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, and then with that of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ would deservedly seem to be lacking in fullness and perfection, as not sufficing for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Wherefore the Lord was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, that He might bend the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">proud</a> necks of men to His own health-giving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and He was not alone <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with it, lest He should show His own to be inferior to this, with which none but He Himself had deserved to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and He did not allow it to continue longer, lest the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> with which He baptizes might seem to need the other to precede it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>12. I ask, therefore, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were remitted by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, what more could the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ confer on those whom the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> desired to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ after they had received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John? But if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were not remitted by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, were those men in the days of Cyprian better than John, of whom he says himself that they "used to seize on estates by treacherous frauds, and increase their gains by accumulated usuries,"  through whose, administration of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> was yet conferred? Or was it because they were contained within the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? What then? Was John not contained within that unity, the friend of the Bridegroom, the preparer of the way of the Lord, the baptizer of the Lord Himself? Who will be mad enough to assert this? Wherefore, although my belief is that John so <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the water of repentance for the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, that those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him received the expectation of the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, the actual remission taking place in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the Lord,&mdash; just as the resurrection which is expected at the last day is fulfilled in hope in us, as the apostle says, that "He has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus;" <span class="stiki" id="note141489"><a href="../bible/eph002.htm#verse6">Ephesians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> and again, "For we are saved by hope;" <span class="stiki" id="note141490"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24</a></span> or as again John himself, while he says, "I indeed <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> you with water unto repentance, for the remission of your <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141491"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse11">Matthew&nbsp;3:11</a></span> yet says, on seeing our Lord, "Behold the Lamb of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which takes away the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of the world," <span class="stiki" id="note141492"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse29">John&nbsp;1:29</a></span> &mdash; nevertheless I am not disposed to contend vehemently against any one who maintains that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were remitted even in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, but that some fuller sanctification was conferred by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ on those whom <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> ordered to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> anew. <span class="stiki" id="note141493"><a href="../bible/act019.htm#verse3">Acts&nbsp;19:3-5</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>13. For we must look at the point which especially concerns the matter before us (whatever be the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, since it is clear that he belongs to the unity of Christ), viz., what is the reason for which it was right that men should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again after receiving the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> John, and why they ought not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again after receiving the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>. For no one denies that in the Lord's field John was as wheat, bearing an hundred-fold, if that be the highest rate of increase; also no one doubts that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, is reckoned in the Lord's harvest among the chaff. Why then is a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again after receiving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> from the wheat, and not after receiving it from the chaff? If it was because he was better than John that <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after John, why did not also Cyprian <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> after his usurious colleagues, than whom he was better beyond all comparison? If it was because they were in unity with him that he did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> after such colleagues, neither ought <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after John, because they were joined together in the same unity. Can it be that defrauders and extortioners belong to the members of that one dove, and that he does not belong to it to whom the full power of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a> was shown by the appearance of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the form of a dove?  Truly he belongs most closely to it; but the others, who must be separated from it either by the occasion of some scandal, or by the winnowing at the last day, do not by any means belong to it, and yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was repeated after John and not after them. What then is the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, except that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> ordered them to receive was not the same as that which was given at the hands of John? And so in the same unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ cannot be repeated though it be given by an usurious minister; but those who receive the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, even from the hands of John Himself, ought to be afterwards <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<p>14. Accordingly, I too might use the words of the blessed Cyprian to turn the hearts of those that hear me to the consideration of something <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> marvellous, if I were to say "that John, who was accounted greater among the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a>&mdash;he who was filled with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">divine grace</a> while yet in his mother's womb; he who was upheld in the spirit and power of Elias; who was not the adversary, but a forerunner and herald of the Lord: who not only foretold our Lord in words, but also showed Him to the sight; who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> Christ Himself, through whom all others are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>," &mdash; he was not worthy to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in such wise that those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again after him; and shall no one think that a man should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> after he had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, by defrauders, by extortioners, by <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>? Is not the answer ready to this invidious question, Why do you think this unmeet, as though either John were dishonored, or the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honored</a>? But His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> ought not to be repeated, of whom John says, "The same is He which baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141496"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> For whoever be the minister by whose hands it is given, it is His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of whom it was said, "The same is He which baptizes." But neither was the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John himself repeated, when the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> commanded those who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by him to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For what they had not received from the friend of the Bridegroom, this it was right that they should receive from the Bridegroom Himself, of whom that friend had said, "The same is He which baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>."</p>

For the Lord Jesus might, if He had so thought fit, have given the power of His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to some one or more of His chief servants, whom He had already made His friends, such as those to whom He says, "Henceforth I call you not servants, but friends;" <span class="stiki" id="note141497"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;15:15</a></span> that, as <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> was shown to be the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> by the rod that budded, <span class="stiki" id="note141498"><a href="../bible/num017.htm#verse8">Numbers&nbsp;17:8</a></span> so in His Church, when more and greater <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> are performed, the ministers of more excellent <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the dispensers of His <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, might be made manifest by some sign, as those who alone ought to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. But if this had been done, then though the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> were given them by the Lord, yet it would necessarily be called their own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as in the case of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John. And so <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> gives thanks to God that he <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> none of those men who, as though forgetting in whose name they had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, were for dividing themselves into factions under the names of different individuals. <span class="stiki" id="note141499"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:12-15</a></span> For when <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is as valid at the hands of a contemptible man as it was when given by an <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostle</a>, it is recognized as the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> neither of this man nor of that, but of Christ; as John bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that he learned, in the case of the Lord Himself, through the appearance of the dove. For in what other respect he said, "And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not," I cannot clearly see. For if he had not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> Him in any sense, he could not have said to Him when He came to his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, "I have need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by You." <span class="stiki" id="note141500"><a href="../bible/mat003.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;3:14</a></span> What is it, therefore, that he says, "I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon Him. And I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not: but He that sent me to baptizewith water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note141501"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse32">John&nbsp;1:32-33</a></span> The dove clearly descended on Him after He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. But while He was yet coming to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, John had said, "I have need to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by You." He therefore already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him. What does he therefore mean by the words, "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not: but He that sent me to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizes with the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," since this took place after He was <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, unless it were that he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him in respect of certain attributes, and in respect of others <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him not? He <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him, indeed, as the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>, the Bridegroom, of whose fullness all should receive; but whereas of His fullness he himself had so received the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> that it should be called the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John, he did not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> whether He would so give it to others also, or whether He would have His own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in such wise, that at whosesoever hands it was given, whether by a man that brought forth fruit a hundredfold, or sixtyfold, or thirtyfold, whether by the wheat or by the chaff, it should be <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> to be of Him alone; and this he learned through the Spirit descending like a dove, and abiding on Him.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>16. Accordingly we find the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> using the expressions, "My glorying," <span class="stiki" id="note141502"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:15</a></span> though it was certainly in the Lord; and "Mine office," <span class="stiki" id="note141503"><a href="../bible/rom011.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;11:13</a></span> and "My <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141504"><a href="../bible/eph003.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;3:4</a></span> and "My gospel," <span class="stiki" id="note141505"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse8">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:8</a></span> although it was confessedly bestowed and given by the Lord; but no one of them ever once said, "My <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>." For neither is the glorying of all of them equal, nor do they all minister with equal powers, nor are they all endowed with equal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, and in preaching the gospel one works more forcibly than another, and so one may be said to be more learned than another in the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> itself; but one cannot be said to be more or less <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> than another, whether he be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by a greater or a less worthy minister. So when "the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousnness, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, variance, emulations, strife, seditions, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, envyings, <a href="../cathen/01274a.htm">drunkenness</a>, revellings, and such like;" <span class="stiki" id="note141506"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19-21</a></span> if it be strange that it should be said, "Men were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after John, and are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>," why is it not equally strange that it should be said, "Men were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after John, and are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> after the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>," seeing that Cyprian himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> in his epistle concerning <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and malignity that the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> are of the party of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and Cyprian himself makes it manifest from the words of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, as we have shown above, that in the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves there were <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> among the very preachers of the name of Christ?</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p>17. That therefore the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of John was not the same as the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, has, I think, been shown with sufficient clearness; and therefore no argument can be drawn from it that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should be repeated after <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> because it was repeated after John: since John was not a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and could have a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which, though granted by Christ, was yet not the very <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, seeing that he had the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of Christ; while a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> can have at once the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ and the perversity of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, as another within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> may have at once the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.</p>

<p>18. But it will be urged that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> after a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is much more required, because John was not a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, and yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was repeated after him. On this principle, a man may say, much more must we rebaptize after a drunkard, because John was sober, and yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> was repeated after him. And we shall have no answer to make to such a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, save that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was given to those who were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by John, because they had it not; but where men have the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, no iniquity on their part can possibly effect that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ should fail to be in them.</p>

<p>19. It is not therefore <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that "by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> first, the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> obtains the right of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>;"  but because he did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> with his own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and though he did not possess the right of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, yet that which he gave is Christ's, and he who received it is Christ's. For many things are given wrongfully and yet they are not therefore said to be non-existent or not given at all. For neither does he who renounces the world in word only and not in deed receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> lawfully, and yet he does receive it. For both Cyprian records that there were such men in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in his day, and we ourselves experience and lament the fact.</p>

<p>20. But it is strange in what sense it can be said that "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> cannot in any way be separated and detached from one another."  For if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> remains inseparably in him who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, how can it be that he can be separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> cannot? But it is clear that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does remain inseparably in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> person; because into whatever depth of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, and into whatever fearful whirlpool of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> person may fall, even to the ruin of <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, he yet is not bereft of his <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And therefore, if through repentance he returns, it is not given again, because it is judged that he could not have been bereft of it. But who can ever <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> person can be separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? For hence all the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have proceeded which deceive by the use of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> terms.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>Wherefore, since it is manifest that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> remains in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> person when he is separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is in him is certainly separated with him. And therefore not all who retain the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> retain the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just as not all who retain the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> retain <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life. Or if we say that only those retain the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who observe the commandments of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, we at once concede that there are many who retain <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and do not retain the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<p>21. Therefore the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> is not "the first to seize <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>," since he has received it from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Nor, though he seceded, could <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> have been lost by him whom we assert no longer to retain the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and yet allow to retain <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. Nor does any one "yield his birthright, and give it to a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>,"  because he says that he took away with him what he could not give lawfully, but what would yet be according to law when given; or that he no longer has lawfully what yet is in accordance with law in his possession. But the birthright rests only in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> conversation and good life, to which all belong of whom that bride consists as her members which has no spot or wrinkle,  or that dove that groans amid the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of the many crows&mdash;unless it be that, while <a href="../cathen/05527c.htm">Esau</a> lost his birthright from his <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after a mess of pottage, <span class="stiki" id="note141511"><a href="../bible/gen025.htm#verse29">Genesis&nbsp;25:29-34</a></span> we are yet to hold that it is retained by defrauders, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, drunkards and the like, over whose <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of his time Cyprian groaned in his epistles. Wherefore, either it is not the same thing to retain the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and to retain the birthright in divine things, or, if every one who retains the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> also retains the birthright, then all those <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> ones do not retain the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who yet both seem and are allowed by every one of us to give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for no one, save the man who is wholly <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of sacred things, would say that they retain the birthright in sacred things.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p>22. But, having considered and handled all these points, we have now come to that peaceful utterance of Cyprian at the end of the epistle, with which I am never sated, though I read and re-read it again and again&mdash;so great is the pleasantness of brotherly <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which breathes forth from it, so great the sweetness of charity in which it abounds. "These things," he says, "we have written unto you, dearest brother, shortly, according to our poor ability, prescribing to or prejudging no one, lest each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should not do what he thinks right, in the free exercise of his own will. We, so far as in us lies, do not contend on the subject of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> with our colleagues and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with whom we maintain concord and peace in the Lord; especially as the apostle also says, 'If any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note141512"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse16">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:16</a></span> We observe patiently and gently charity of spirit, the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> of our brotherhood, the bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>. For this reason also, to the best of our poor ability, by the permission and the inspiration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> we have written this treatise on 'The Good of Patience,' which we have sent to you in consideration of our mutual <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>." </p>

<p>23. There are many things to be considered in these words, wherein the brightness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity shines forth in this man, who "loved the beauty of the Lord's house, and the place of the tabernacle of His habitation."  First, that he did not conceal what he felt; then, that he set it forth so gently and peacefully, in that he maintained the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with those who thought otherwise, because he understood how great healthfulness was bound up in the bond of peace, loving it so much, and maintaining it with sobriety, seeing and feeling that even men who think differently may entertain their several sentiments with saving charity. For he would not say that he could maintain divine concord or the peace of the Lord with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men; for the <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man can observe peace towards <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, but he cannot be united with them in the peace which they have not. Lastly, that prescribing to no one, and prejudging no one, lest each <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should not do what he thinks right in the free exercise of his own will, he has left for us also, whatsoever we may be, a place for treating peacefully of those things with him. For he is present, not only in his letters, but by that very charity which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in so extraordinary a degree in him, and which can never die. Longing, therefore, with the aid of his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, to cling to and be in union with him, if I be not hindered by the unmeetness of my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, I will learn if I can through his letters with how great peace and comfort the Lord administered His Church through him; and, putting on the bowels of humility through the moving influence of his discourse, if, in common with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> at large, I entertain any doctrine more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> than his, I will not prefer my heart to his, even in the point in which he, though holding different views, was yet not severed from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout the world. For in that, when that question was yet undecided for want of full discussion, though his sentiments differed from those of many of his colleagues, yet he observed so great moderation, that he would not mutilate the sacred fellowship of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a> by any stain of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, a greater strength of excellence appeared in him than would have been shown if, without that <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, he had held views on every point not only <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but coinciding with their own. Nor should I be acting as he would wish, if I were to pretend to prefer his talent and his fluency of discourse and copiousness of learning to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Council of all nations, whereat he was assuredly present through the unity of his spirit, especially as he is now placed in such full light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as to see with perfect certainty what he was here seeking in the spirit of perfect peace. For out of that rich abundance he smiles at all that here seems eloquence in us, as though it were the first essay of infancy; there he sees by what rule of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a> he acted here, that nothing should be dearer in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to him than unity. There, too, with unspeakable delight he beholds with what prescient and most merciful <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> the Lord, that He might heal our swellings, "chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise," <span class="stiki" id="note141515"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse27">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:27</a></span> and, in the ordering of the members of His Church, placed all things in such a healthful way, that men should not say that they were chosen to the help of the gospel for their own talent or learning, of whose source they yet were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a>, and so be puffed up with deadly <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>. Oh, how Cyprian rejoices! With how much more perfect calmness does he behold how greatly it conduces to the health of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, that in the writings even of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> orators there should be found what merits blame, and in the writings of the fishermen there should nothing of the sort be found! And so I, being fully assured of this <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> of that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, neither in any way venture to think or say that my writings are free from every kind of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, nor, in opposing that opinion of his, wherein it seemed to him that those who came from among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were to be received otherwise than either they had been in former days, as he himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, or are now received, as is the reasonable custom, confirmed by a plenary Council of the whole <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> world, do I set against him my own view, but that of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which he so loved and loves, in which he brought forth such abundant fruit with tolerance, whose entirety he himself was not, but in whose entirety he remained; whose root he never left, but, though he already brought forth fruit from its root, he was purged by the heavenly Husbandman that he should bring forth more fruit; <span class="stiki" id="note141516"><a href="../bible/joh015.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;15:2</a></span> for whose peace and safety, that the wheat might not be rooted out together with the tares, he both reproved with the freedom of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and endured with the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of charity, so many <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> on the part of men who were placed in unity with himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.</h2>

<p>24. Whence Cyprian himself  again admonishes us with the greatest fullness, that many who were dead in their trespasses and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, although they did not belong to the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and the members of that innocent and guileless dove (so that if she alone <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, they certainly could not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>), yet to all appearance seemed both to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. And among them, however dead they are, their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> nevertheless lives, which is not dead, and death shall have no more dominion over it. Since, therefore, there be dead men within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, nor are they concealed, for else Cyprian would not have spoken of them so much, who either do not belong at all to that living dove, or at least do not as yet belong to her; and since there be dead men without, who yet more clearly do not belong to her at all, or not as yet; and since it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that "another man cannot be quickened by one who himself lives not,"&mdash; it is therefore clear that those who within are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, if they approach the sacrament with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion of heart, are quickened by Him whose <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> it is. But if they renounce the world in word and not in deed, as Cyprian declares to be the case with some who are within, it is then manifest that they are not themselves quickened unless they be converted, and yet that they have <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> even though they be not converted. Whence also it is likewise clear that those who are dead without, although they neither "live themselves, nor quicken others," yet have the living <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which would profit them unto life so soon as they should be converted unto peace.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p>25. Wherefore, as regards those who received the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who came from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> in the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ with which they had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and said "that they followed ancient custom," as indeed the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> now receives such, it is in vain urged against them "that among the ancients there were as yet only the first beginning of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> and schisms,  so that those were involved in them who were seceders from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and had originally been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, so that it was not necessary that they should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again when they returned and did penance." For so soon as each several <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, and departed from the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it was possible that, I will not even say the next day, but even on that very day, its votaries might have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> some who flocked to them. And therefore if this was the old custom, that they should be so received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> (as could not be denied even by those who maintained the contrary part in the discussion), there can be no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> in the mind of any one who pays careful attention to the matter, that those also were so received who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<p>26. But I cannot see what show of reason there is in this, that the name of "erring sheep"  should be denied to one whose lot it has been that, while seeking the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, he has fallen into the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in their body; while he is held to have become a sheep already  within the body of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, who has renounced the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, and has received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in such falseness of heart as this. Or if such an one also does not become a sheep unless after turning to God with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart, then, as he is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> at the time when he becomes a sheep, if he had been already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but was not yet a sheep; so he too, who comes from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> that he may become a sheep, is not then to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> if he had been already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, though he was not yet a sheep. Wherefore, since even all the bad that are within&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, the drunkards, and those that live contrary to the discipline of Christ&mdash; may be deservedly called liars, and in darkness, and dead, and antichrists, do they yet therefore not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, on the ground that "there can be nothing common between <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> and <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, between light and darkness, between death and <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, between <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> and Christ?" </p>

<p>27. He makes an assumption, then, not "of mere custom," but "of the reason of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> itself,"  when he says that the sacrament of God cannot be turned to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of any men, since it is declared to exist even in those who have erred. Assuredly the Apostle John says most plainly, "He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is in darkness even until now;" <span class="stiki" id="note141522"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:9</a></span> and again, "Whosoever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer;" <span class="stiki" id="note141523"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:15</a></span> and why, therefore, do they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> whom Cyprian himself declares to be in the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>? </p>

<h2>Chapter 20.</h2>

<p>How does a murderer cleanse and sanctify the water?  How can darkness bless the oil? But if God is present in His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> to confirm His words by whomsoever the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> may be administered, then both the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of God are everywhere valid, and <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men whom they profit not are everywhere perverse.</p>

<p>28. But what kind of argument is this, that "a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> must be considered not to have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because he has not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>?" And it must be acknowledged that "when he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, he is questioned about the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>."  Just as though the same question about the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> were not put in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to him who within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> renounces the world in word and not in deed. As therefore his false answer does not prevent what he receives from being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so also the false reply of the other about the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church does not prevent what he receives from being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and as the former, if he afterwards fulfill with <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> what he promised in <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>, does not receive a second <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but only an amended life, so also in the case of the latter, if he come afterwards to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> about which he gave a false answer to the question put to him, thinking that he had it when he had it not, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself which he did not possess is given him, but what he had received is not repeated. But I cannot tell why it should be, that while God can "sanctify the oil" in answer to the words which proceed out of the mouth of a murderer, "He yet cannot sanctify it on the altar reared by a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>," unless it be that He who is not hindered by the false conversion of the heart of man within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is hindered by the false erection of some wood without from deigning to be present in His <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, though no falseness on the part of men can hinder Him. If, therefore, what is said in the gospel, that "God hears not sinners," <span class="stiki" id="note141527"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;9:31</a></span> extends so far that the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> cannot be celebrated by a sinner, how then does He hear a murderer <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">praying</a>, either over the water of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or over the oil, or over the eucharist, or over the heads of those on whom his hand is laid? All which things are nevertheless done, and are valid, even at the hands of murderers, that is, at the hands of those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> their brethren, even within, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself. Since "no one can give what he does not possess himself,"  how does a murderer give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>? And yet such an one even baptizes within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. It is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, therefore, that gives the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> even when a man of this kind is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.</h2>

<p>29. But as to what he says, that "he who comes to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and renewed, that within he may be hallowed through the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>,"  what will he do, if within also he meets with those who are not <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>? Or can it be that the murderer is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>? And if the reason for his being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is that "he should put off this very thing also that he, being a man that sought to come to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, fell, through the deceit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, on one profane,"  where is he afterwards to put off this, that he may chance, while seeking a man of God within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, to have fallen, through the deceit of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, on a murderer? If "there cannot be in a man something that is void and something that is valid,"  why is it possible that in a murderer the sacrament should be <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and his heart <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">unholy</a>? If "whosoever cannot give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>,"  why does the murderer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Or how has the murderer the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, when every one that has the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> is filled with light, but "he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is still in darkness?" <span class="stiki" id="note141533"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:9</a></span> If because "there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and one Spirit,"  therefore they cannot have the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who have not the one Spirit, why do the innocent man and the murderer within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> have the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and not have the one Spirit? So therefore the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> may have the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and yet not have the one Church, as in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the innocent man and the murderer may have the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, though they have not the one Spirit; for as there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so there is one Spirit and one Church. And so the result is, that in each person we must acknowledge what he already has, and to each person we must give what he has not. If "nothing can be confirmed and ratified with God which has been done by those whom God calls His enemies and foes,"  why is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> confirmed which is given by murderers? Are we not to call murderers the enemies and foes of the Lord? But "he that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer." How then did they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, the servant of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, and thereby <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> Jesus Himself, since He Himself said to Saul, "Why do you persecute me?" <span class="stiki" id="note141536"><a href="../bible/act009.htm#verse4">Acts&nbsp;9:4</a></span> when he was <a href="../cathen/11703a.htm">persecuting</a> His servants, and since at the last He Himself shall say, "Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these that are mine, you did it not to me?" <span class="stiki" id="note141537"><a href="../bible/mat025.htm#verse45">Matthew&nbsp;25:45</a></span> Wherefore all who go out from us are not of us, but not all who are with us are of us; just as when men thresh, all that flies from the threshing-floor is shown not to be grain, but not all that remains there is therefore grain. And so John too says, "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> have continued with us." <span class="stiki" id="note141538"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> Wherefore God gives the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> even through the hands of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men, but the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself only by Himself or through His <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>. And therefore He gives remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> either of Himself, or through the members of that dove to whom He says, "Whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they are retained." <span class="stiki" id="note141539"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;20:23</a></span> But since no one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is the sacrament of the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is possessed even by murderers, who are yet in darkness because the <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of their brethren is not excluded from their hearts, therefore either no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> is given to them if their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is accompanied by no change of heart for the better, or if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted, they at once return on them again. And we learn that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in itself, because it is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and whether it be given or whether it be received by men of such like character, it cannot be polluted by any perversity of theirs, either within, or yet outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.</h2>

<p>30. Accordingly we agree with Cyprian that "<a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;"  but we maintain that they can give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash;which indeed in them, both when they give and when they receive it, is profitable only to their destruction, as misusing so great a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; just as also the malicious and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, whom Cyprian himself acknowledges to be within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, cannot give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, while we all confess that they can give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For if it was said of those who have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a> against us, "If you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses," <span class="stiki" id="note141541"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;6:15</a></span> how much more impossible is it that their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> should be forgiven who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> the brethren by whom they are loved, and are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in that very <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>; and yet when they are brought to the right way, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not given them anew, but that very pardon which they did not then deserve is granted them in their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion? And so even what Cyprian wrote to Quintus, and what, in conjunction with his colleagues Liberalis, Caldonius, Junius, and the rest, he wrote to Saturninus, Maximus, and others, is all found, on due consideration, to be in no wise meet to be preferred as against the agreement of the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, of which they rejoiced that they were members, and from which they neither cut themselves away nor allowed others to be cut away who held a contrary opinion, until at length, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, it was made manifest, by a plenary Council many years afterwards, what was the more perfect way, and that not by the institution of any novelty, but by confirming what was old.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.</h2>

<p>31. Cyprian writes also to Pompeius  about this selfsame matter, and clearly shows in that letter that Stephen, who, as we learn, was then <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of the Roman Church, not only did not agree with him upon the points before us, but even wrote and taught the opposite views. But Stephen certainly did not "communicate with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,"  merely because he did not dare to impugn the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> remained perfect in the midst of their perversity. For if none have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who entertain false views about <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it has been <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> sufficiently, in my opinion, that this may happen even within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. "The <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>," indeed, "gave no injunctions on the point;"  but the custom, which is opposed to Cyprian, may be supposed to have had its origin in apostolic tradition, just as there are many things which are observed by the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and therefore are fairly held to have been enjoined by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, which yet are not mentioned in their writings.</p>

<p>32. But it will be urged that it is written of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> that "they are condemned of themselves." <span class="stiki" id="note141545"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse11">Titus&nbsp;3:11</a></span> What then? Are they not also condemned of themselves to whom it was said, "For wherein you judge another, you condemn yourself?" <span class="stiki" id="note141546"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;2:1</a></span> But to these the apostle says, "Thou that preachest a man should not steal, do you steal?" <span class="stiki" id="note141547"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse21">Romans&nbsp;2:21</a></span> and so forth. And such <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> were they who, being <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> and established in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity with Cyprian himself, used to plunder estates by treacherous frauds, preaching all the time to the people the words of the apostle, who says, "Nor shall extortioners inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141548"><a href="../bible/1co006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:10</a></span> </p>

<p>33. Wherefore I will do no more than run shortly through the other sentiments founded on the same rules, which are in the aforesaid letter written to Pompeius. By what authority of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture is it shown that "it is against the commandment of God that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> coming from the society of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, if they have already there received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, are not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again?"  But it is clearly shown that many pretended <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, though they are not joined in the same bond of charity with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, without which anything <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> that they may have been able to possess is of no profit to them, yet have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in common with the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, as has been already sufficiently <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> with the greatest fullness. He says "that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, are mutually incapable of separation from each other, and therefore" he wishes that "those who are separated from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> should be understood to be separated also from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>."  But if this is the case, then when any one has received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it remains so long in him as he himself remains in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is not so. For it is not restored to him when he returns, just because he did not lose it when he seceded. But as the disaffected sons have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> in the same manner as the beloved sons, and yet they have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; so <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also have not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> have, and yet they have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. "For the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of discipline will flee deceit," <span class="stiki" id="note141551"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom&nbsp;1:5</a></span> and yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> will not flee from it. And so, as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> can continue in one from whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> withdraws Himself, so can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> continue where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not. But if "the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>" were not "applied to one coming from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>,"  he would be as it were judged to be wholly blameless; but for the uniting of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, which is the greatest gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, without which any other <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> thing that there may be in a man is profitless to his <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, hands are laid on <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> when they are brought to a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 24.</h2>

<p>34. I remember that I have already discussed at sufficient length the question of "the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>," and how this saying is to be taken, "As many of you as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> into Christ have put on <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141554"><a href="../bible/gal003.htm#verse27">Galatians&nbsp;3:27</a></span> For neither are the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since it is written, "What agreement has the temple of God with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note141555"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> And Cyprian has adduced the testimony of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> to the fact that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. But men put on Christ, sometimes so far as to receive the sacrament, sometimes so much further as to receive <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of life. And the first of these is common to good and bad alike; the second, peculiar to the good and <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a>. Wherefore, if "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> cannot be without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>," then <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have the Spirit also&mdash;but to destruction, not to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, just as was the case with Saul. <span class="stiki" id="note141556"><a href="../bible/1sa019.htm#verse23">1&nbsp;Samuel&nbsp;19:23</a></span> For in the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> devils are cast out through the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which even he was able to do who was without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which called forth a suggestion from the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> to their Lord. <span class="stiki" id="note141557"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse38">Mark&nbsp;9:38</a></span> Just as the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, who yet are not the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For "what agreement has the temple of God with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>?" If therefore the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> have not the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, and yet have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, it is possible for <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to exist without the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>.</p> 

<p>35. If therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is rendered "unable to engender sons to God through Christ, because it is not the bride of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>,"  neither can that crowd of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> men established within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since it is also not the bride of Christ; for the bride of Christ is described as being without spot or wrinkle.  Therefore either not all <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> are the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or even that which is not the bride can engender the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But as it is asked whether "he is spiritually born who has received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ in the midst of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>,"  so it may be asked whether he is spiritually born who has received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, without being turned to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart, of whom it cannot be said that he has not received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.</h2>

<p>36. I am unwilling to go on to handle again what Cyprian poured forth with signs of irritation against Stephen, as it is, moreover, quite unnecessary. For they are but the selfsame arguments which have already been sufficiently discussed; and it is better to pass over those points which involved the danger of baneful dissension. But Stephen thought that we should even hold aloof from those who endeavored to destroy the primitive custom in the matter of receiving <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; whereas Cyprian, moved by the difficulty of the question itself, and being most largely endowed with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> bowels of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity, thought that we ought to remain at unity with those who differed in opinion from ourselves. Therefore, although he was not without excitement, though of a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> brotherly kind, in his indignation, yet the peace of Christ prevailed in their hearts, that in such a dispute no <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> should arise between them. But it was not found that "hence grew more abundant <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms,"  because what is of Christ in them is approved, and what is of themselves is condemned; for all the more those who hold this law of rebaptizing were cut into smaller fragments.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.</h2>

<p>37. To go on to what he says, "that a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> should be 'teachable,'"  adding, "But he is teachable who is gentle and meek to learn; for a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> ought not only to teach, but to learn as well, since he is indeed the better teacher who daily grows and advances by learning better things;" &mdash; in these words assuredly the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man, endowed with <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> charity, sufficiently points out that we should not hesitate to read his letters in such a sense, that we should feel no difficulty if the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should afterwards confirm what had been discovered by further and longer discussions; because, as there were many things which the learned Cyprian might teach, so there was still something which the teachable Cyprian might learn. But the admonition that he gives us, "that we should go back to the fountain, that is, to apostolic tradition, and thence turn the channel of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to our times,"  is most excellent, and should be followed without hesitation. It is handed down to us, therefore, as he himself records, by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, that there is "one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and one Christ, and one hope, and one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and one Church, and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>."  Since then we find that in the times of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> themselves there were some who had not the one hope, but had the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is so brought down to us from the fountain itself, that it is clear to us that it is possible that though there is one Church, as there is one hope, and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, they may yet have the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who have not the one Church; just as even in those early times it was possible that men should have the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who had not the one hope. For how had they one hope with the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and the just, who used to say, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die," <span class="stiki" id="note141566"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:32</a></span> asserting that there was no resurrection of the dead? And yet they were among the very men to whom the same apostle says, "Was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> crucified for you? Or were you <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the name of <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note141567"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse13">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> For he writes most manifestly to them, saying, "How say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?" <span class="stiki" id="note141568"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse12">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:12</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 27.</h2>

<p>38. And in that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is thus described in the Song of Songs, "A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed, a well of living water; your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits;" <span class="stiki" id="note141569"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse12">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:12-13</a></span> I dare not understand this save of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and just,&mdash; not of the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, and defrauders, and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>, and drunkards, and the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, of whom we yet both learn most fully from Cyprian's letters, as I have often shown, and teach ourselves, that they had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in common with the just, in common with whom they certainly had not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity. For I would that some one would tell me how they "crept into the garden enclosed and the fountain sealed," of whom Cyprian bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that they renounced the world in word and not in deed, and that yet they were within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For if they both are themselves there, and are themselves the bride of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, can she then be as she is described "without spot or wrinkle," <span class="stiki" id="note141570"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse27">Ephesians&nbsp;5:27</a></span> and is the fair dove defiled with such a portion of her members? Are these the thorns among which she is a lily, as it is said in the same Song? <span class="stiki" id="note141571"><a href="../bible/son002.htm#verse2">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;2:2</a></span> So far therefore, as the lily extends, so far does "the garden enclosed and the fountain sealed," namely, through all those just <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> inwardly in the <a href="../cathen/03777a.htm">circumcision</a> of the heart <span class="stiki" id="note141572"><a href="../bible/rom002.htm#verse29">Romans&nbsp;2:29</a></span> (for "the king's daughter is all <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> within" ), in whom is the fixed number of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> <a href="../cathen/12378a.htm">predestined</a> before the foundation of the world. But that multitude of thorns, whether in secret or in open separation, is pressing on it from without, above number. "If I would declare them," it is said, "and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered."  The number, therefore, of the just <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, "who are the called according to His purpose," <span class="stiki" id="note141575"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse28">Romans&nbsp;8:28</a></span> of whom it is said, "The Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His," <span class="stiki" id="note141576"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse19">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:19</a></span> is itself "the garden enclosed, the fountain sealed, a well of living water, the orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits." Of this number some live according to the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and enter on the excellent way of charity; and when they "restore a man that is overtaken in a fault in the spirit of meekness, they consider themselves, lest they also be tempted." <span class="stiki" id="note141577"><a href="../bible/gal006.htm#verse1">Galatians&nbsp;6:1</a></span> And when it happens that they also are themselves overtaken, the affection of charity is but a little checked, and not extinguished; and again rising up and being kindled afresh, it is restored to its former course. For they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to say, "My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> melts for heaviness: strengthen me according unto Your word."  But when "in anything they be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto them," <span class="stiki" id="note141579"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> if they abide in the burning flame of charity, and do not break the bond of peace. But some who are yet carnal, and full of fleshly appetites, are instant in working out their progress; and that they may become fit for heavenly food, they are nourished with the milk of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>, they avoid in the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of God whatever is manifestly corrupt even in the opinion of the world, and they strive most watchfully that they may be less and less delighted with worldly and temporal matters. They observe most constantly the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> which has been sought out with diligence; and if in anything they stray from it, they submit to speedy correction under <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> authority, although, in Cyprian's words, they be tossed about, by reason of their fleshly appetite, with the various conflicts of phantasies. There are some also who as yet live wickedly, or even lie in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> or the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, and yet even then "the Lord <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His." For, in that unspeakable foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, many who seem to be without are in reality within, and many who seem to be within yet really are without. Of all those, therefore, who, if I may so say, are inwardly and secretly within, is that "enclosed garden" composed, "the fountain sealed, a well of living water, the orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits." The divinely imparted gifts of these are partly peculiar to themselves, as in this world the charity that never fails, and in the world to come <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life; partly they are common with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and perverse men, as all the other things in which consist the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysteries</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.</h2>

<p>39. Hence, therefore, we have now set before us an easier and more simple consideration of that ark of which <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a> was the builder and pilot. For Peter says that in the ark of <a href="../cathen/11088a.htm">Noah</a>, "few, that is, eight <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>, were saved by water. The like figure whereunto even <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does also now save us, (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> towards God)." <span class="stiki" id="note141580"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:20-21</a></span> Wherefore, if those appear to men to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity who renounce the world in words only and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, how do they belong to the <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mystery</a> of this ark in whom there is not the answer of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>? Or how are they saved by water, who, making a bad use of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, though they seem to be within, yet persevere to the end of their days in a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and abandoned course of life? Or how can they fail to be saved by water, of whom Cyprian himself records that they were in time past simply admitted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they had received in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>? For the same unity of the ark saved them, in which no one has been saved except by water. For Cyprian himself says, "The Lord is able of His mercy to grant pardon, and not to sever from the gifts of His Church those who, being in all simplicity admitted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, have fallen asleep within her pale."  If not by water, how in the ark? If not in the ark, how in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? But if in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, certainly in the ark; and if in the ark, certainly by water. It is therefore possible that some who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without may be considered, through the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, to have been really <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within, because within the water begins to be profitable to them unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; nor can they be said to have been otherwise saved in the ark except by water. And again, some who seemed to have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within may be considered, through the same foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> to have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without, since, by making a bad use of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, they die by water, which then happened to no one who was not outside the ark. Certainly it is clear that, when we speak of within and without in relation to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is the position of the heart that we must consider, not that of the body, since all who are within in heart are saved in the unity of the ark through the same water, through which all who are in heart without, whether they are also in body without or not, die as enemies of unity. As therefore it was not another but the same water that saved those who were placed within the ark, and destroyed those who were left without the ark, so it is not by different baptisms, but by the same, that good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> are saved, and bad <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> perish. But what the most blessed Cyprian thinks of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and how the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are utterly crushed by his authority; notwithstanding the much I have already said, I have yet determined to set forth by itself, if God will, with somewhat greater fullness and perspicuity, so soon as I shall have first said about his Council what I think is due from me, which, in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God's</a> <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a>, I shall attempt in the following book.</p>
