<h1>On Baptism, Against the Donatists (Book VI)</h1>

<p><strong>In which is considered the Council of Carthage, held under the authority and presidency of Cyprian, to determine the question of the baptism of heretics.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. It might perhaps have been sufficient, that after the reasons have been so often repeated, and considered, and discussed with such variety of treatment, supplemented too, with the addition of <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> from <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture, and the concurrent testimony of so many passages from Cyprian himself, even those who are slow of heart should thus understand, as I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> they do, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ cannot be rendered void by any perversity on the part of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, whether in administering or receiving it. And when we find that in those times, when the point in question was decided in a manner contrary to ancient custom, after discussions carried on without violation of saving charity and unity, it appeared to some even eminent men who were <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, among whom the blessed Cyprian was specially conspicuous, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ could not exist among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics, this simply arose from their not distinguishing the sacrament from the effect or use of the sacrament; and because its effect and use were not found among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in freeing them from their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and setting their hearts right, the sacrament itself was also thought to be wanting among them. But if we turn our eyes to the multitude of chaff within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, since these also who are perverse and lead an abandoned life in unity itself appear to have no power either of giving or retaining remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, seeing that it is not to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> but the good sons that it was said, "Whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they are retained," <span class="stiki" id="note141582"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;20:23</a></span> yet that such <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> both have, and give, and receive the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, was sufficiently manifest to the pastors of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> dispersed over the whole world, through whom the original custom was afterwards confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council; so that even the sheep which was straying outside, and had received the mark of the Lord from false plunderers outside, if it seek the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> unity, is purified from <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, is freed from captivity, is healed of its wound, and yet the mark of the Lord is recognized rather than rejected in it; since the mark itself is often impressed both by wolves and on wolves, who seem indeed to be within the fold, but yet are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> by the fruits of their conduct, in which they persevere even to the end, not to belong to that sheep which is one in many; because, according to the foreknowledge of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as many sheep wander outside, so many wolves lurk treacherously within, among whom the Lord yet <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> them that are His, which hear only the voice of the Shepherd, even when He calls by the voice of men like the <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, of whom it was said, "Whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do." <span class="stiki" id="note141583"><a href="../bible/mat023.htm#verse3">Matthew&nbsp;23:3</a></span> </p>

<p>2. For as the spiritual man, keeping "the end of the commandment," that is, "charity out of a pure heart, and of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned," <span class="stiki" id="note141584"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> can see some things less clearly out of a body which is yet "corruptible and presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141585"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> and is liable to be otherwise minded in some things which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> will reveal <span class="stiki" id="note141586"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> to him in His own good time if he abide in the same charity, so in a carnal and perverse man something good and useful may be found, which has its origin not in the man himself, but in some other source. For as in the fruitful branch there is found something which must be purged that it may bring forth more fruit, so also a grape is often found to hang on a cane that is barren and dry or fettered. And so, as it is foolish to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the portions which require purging  in the fruitful branch, while he acts wisely who does not reject the sweet fruit wherever it may hang, so, if any one cuts himself off from unity by rebaptizing, simply because it seemed to Cyprian that one ought to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> again those who came from the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, such a man turns aside from what merits praise in that great man, and follows what requires correction, and does not even attain to the very thing he follows after. For Cyprian, while grievously abhorring, in his <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, all those who severed themselves from unity, thought that thereby they were separated from <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself; while these men, thinking it at most a slight offense that they themselves are severed from the unity of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even maintain that His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not in that unity, but issued forth with them. Therefore they are so far from the fruitfulness of Cyprian, as not even to be equal to the parts in him which needed purging.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>3. Again, if any one not having charity, and walking in the abandoned paths of a most <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> life, seems to be within while he really is without, and at the same time does not seek for the repetition of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> even in the case of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, it in no wise helps his barrenness, because he is not rendered fruitful with his own fruit, but laden with that of others. But it is possible that some one may flourish in the root of charity, and may be most rightly minded in the point in which Cyprian was otherwise minded, and yet there may be more that is fruitful in Cyprian than in him, more that requires purging in him than in Cyprian. Not only, therefore, do we not compare bad <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> with the blessed Cyprian, but even good <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a> we do not hastily pronounce to be on an equality with him whom our <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> mother Church counts among the few rare men of surpassing excellence and <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, although these others may recognize the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ even among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, while he thought otherwise; so that, by the instance of Cyprian, who saw one point less clearly, and yet remained most firm in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it might be shown more clearly to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> what a <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> crime it was to break the bond of peace. For neither were the blind <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>, although they sometimes enjoined what was right to be done, to be compared to the Apostle Peter, though he at times enjoined what was not right. But not only is their dryness not to be compared to his greenness, but even the fruit of others may not be deemed equal to his fertility. For no one now compels the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to judaize, and yet no one now in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, however great his progress in goodness, may be compared with the apostleship of Peter. Wherefore, while rendering due reverence, and paying, so far as I can, the fitting <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> to the peaceful <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyr</a> Cyprian, I yet venture to say that his view concerning the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> was contrary to that which was afterwards brought to light by a decision, not of mine, but of the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, confirmed and strengthened by the authority of a plenary Council: just as, while paying the reverence he deserves to Peter, the first of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> and most eminent of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrs</a>, I yet venture to say that he did not do right in compelling the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> to judaize; for this also, I say, not of my own teaching, but according to the wholesome doctrine of the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, retained and preserved through out the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note141587"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse14">Galatians&nbsp;2:14</a></span> </p>

<p>4. Therefore, in discussing the opinion of Cyprian, though myself of far inferior merit to Cyprian, I say that good and bad alike can have, can give, can receive the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>&mdash;the good, indeed, to their health and profit; the bad to their destruction and ruin&mdash;while the sacrament itself is of equal perfectness in both of them; and that it is of no consequence to its equal perfectness in all, how much worse the man may be that has it among the bad, just as it makes no difference how much better he may be that has it among the good. And accordingly it makes no difference either how much worse he may be that confers it, as it makes no difference how much better he may be; and so it makes no difference how much worse he may be that receives it, as it makes no difference how much better he may be. For the sacrament is equally <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, in virtue of its own excellence, both in those who are unequally just, and in those who are unequally <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>5. But I think that we have sufficiently shown, both from the canon of Scripture, and from the letters of Cyprian himself, that bad men, while by no means converted to a better <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, can have, and confer, and receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, of whom it is most clear that they do not belong to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>, though they seem to be within it, inasmuch as they are <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> thinkers, and the like; while she is one dove, <span class="stiki" id="note141588"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse8">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:8-9</a></span> modest and chaste, a bride without spot or wrinkle,  a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed, an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits, <span class="stiki" id="note141590"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse12">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:12-13</a></span> with all similar properties which are attributed to her; and all this can only be understood to be in the good, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, and just,&mdash; following, that is, not only the operations of the gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which are common to good and bad alike, but also the inner bond of charity conspicuous in those who have the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, to whom the Lord says, "Whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they are retained." <span class="stiki" id="note141591"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;20:23</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>6. And so it is clear that no good ground is shown herein why the bad man, who has <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, may not also confer it; and as he has it to destruction, so he may also confer it to destruction&mdash;not because this is the character of the thing conferred, nor of the person conferring, but because it is the character of him on whom it is conferred. For when a bad man confers it on a <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> man, that is, on one in the bond of unity, converted with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion, the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a> of him who confers it makes no severance between the good sacrament which is conferred, and the good member of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on whom it is conferred. And when his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven him on his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they are forgiven by those to whom he is united by his <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion. For the same Spirit forgives them, which is given to all the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> that cling to one another in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, whether they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> one another in the body or not. Similarly when a man's <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are retained, they are assuredly retained by those from whom he, in whom they are retained, separates himself by dissimilarity of life, and by the turning away of a corrupt heart, whether they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> him in the body or not.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>7. Wherefore all bad men are separated in the spirit from the good; but if they are separated in the body also by a manifest dissension, they are made yet worse. But, as it has been said, it makes no difference to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> how much worse the man may be that has it, or how much worse he that confers it: yet he that is separated may confer it, as he that is separated may have it; but as he has it to destruction, so he may confer it to destruction. But he on whom he confers it may receive it to his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul's</a> health, if he, on his part, receive it not in separation; as it has happened to many that, in a catholic spirit, and with heart not alienated from the unity of peace, they have, under some pressure of impending death, turned hastily to some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> and received from him the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ without any share in his perversity, so that, whether dying or restored to life, they by no means remain in communion with those to whom they never passed in heart. But if the recipient himself has received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in separation, he receives it so much the more to his destruction, in proportion to the greatness of the good which he has not received well; and it tends the more to his destruction in his separation, as it would avail the more to the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of one in unity. And so, if, reforming himself from his perverseness and turning from his separation, he should come to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peace, his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted through the bond of peace and the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> under which his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> were retained through the sacrilege of separation, because that is always <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> both in the just and the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, which is neither increased by the righteousness nor diminished by the unrighteousness of any man.</p>

<p>8. This being the case, what bearing has it on so clear a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, that many of his fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> agreed with Cyprian in that opinion, and advanced their own several opinions on the same side, except that his charity towards the unity of Christ might become more and more conspicuous? For if he had been the only one to hold that opinion, with no one to agree with him, he might have been thought, in remaining, to have shrunk from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, because he found no companions in his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; but when so many agreed with him, he showed, by remaining in unity with the rest who thought differently from him, that he preserved the most sacred bond of universal catholicity, not from any <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of isolation, but from the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of peace. Wherefore it might indeed seem now to be superfluous to consider the several opinions of the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> also in that Council; but since those who are slow in heart think that no answer has been made at all, if to any passage in any discourse the answer which might be brought to bear on the spot be given not there but somewhere else, it is better that by reading much they should be polished into sharpness, than that by understanding little they should have room left for complaining that the argument has not been fairly conducted.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>9. First, then, let us record for further consideration the case proposed for decision by Cyprian himself, with which he initiates the proceedings of the Council, and by which he shows a peaceful spirit, abounding in the fruitfulness of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity. "You have read," he says, "most beloved colleagues, what Jubaianus, our fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, has written to me, consulting my poor ability about the unlawful and profane <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and what I have written back to him, expressing to him the same opinion that I have expressed once and again and often, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and sanctified with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Another letter also of Jubaianus has been read to you, in which, agreeably to his sincere and religious devotion, in answer to our epistle, he not only expressed his assent to it, but also gratefully acknowledged that he had received instruction. It remains that we should individually express our opinions on this same subject, judging no one, and removing no one from the right of communion if he should entertain a different opinion. For neither does any one of us set himself up as a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, or by tyrannical terror force his colleagues to the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeying</a>, since every <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, in the free use of his liberty and power, has the right of free judgment, and can no more be judged by another than he can himself judge another. But we are all awaiting the judgment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> who alone has the power both of preferring us in the government of His Church, and of judging of our actions." </p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>10. I have already, I think, argued to the best of my power, in the preceding books, in the interests of <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unanimity and counsel, in whose unity these continued as <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">pious</a> members, in reply not only to the letter which Cyprian wrote to Jubaianus, but also to that which he sent to Quintus, and that which, in conjunction with certain of his colleagues, he sent to certain other colleagues, and that which he sent to Pompeius. Wherefore it seems now to be fitting to consider also what the others severally thought, and that with the liberty of which he himself would not deprive us, as he says, "Judging no one, nor removing any from the right of communion if he entertain different opinions." And that he did not say this with the object of arriving at the hidden thoughts of his colleagues, extracted as it were from their secret lurking-places, but because he really loved peace and unity, is very easily to be seen from other passages of the same sort, where he wrote to individuals as to Jubaianus himself. "These things," he says, "we have written very shortly in answer to you, most beloved brother, according to our poor ability, not preventing any one of the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> by our writing or judgment, from acting as he thinks right, having a free exercise of his own judgment."  And that it might not seem that any one, because of his entertaining different opinions in this same free exercise of his judgment, should be driven from the society of his brethren, he goes on to say, "We, so far as lies in us, do not strive on behalf of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> against our colleagues and fellow <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, with whom we maintain godly unity and the peace of our Lord;"  and a little later he says, "Charity of spirit, respect for our fraternity, the bond of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, the harmony of the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, are by us maintained with patience and gentleness."  And so also in the epistle which he wrote to Magnus, when he was asked whether there was any difference in the efficacy of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by sprinkling or by immersion, "In this matter," he says, "I am too modest and diffident to prevent any one by my judgment from thinking as he deems right, and acting as he thinks."  By which discourses he clearly shows that these subjects were being handled by them at a time when they were not yet received as decided beyond all question, but were being investigated with great care as being yet unrevealed. We, therefore, maintaining on the subject of the identity of all baptisms what must be acknowledged everywhere to be the custom  of the universal Church, and what is confirmed by the decision of general Councils,  and taking greater confidence also from the words of Cyprian, which allowed me even then to hold opinions differing from his own without forfeiting the right of communion, seeing that greater importance and praise were attached to unity, such as the blessed Cyprian and his colleagues, with whom he held that Council, maintained with those of different opinions, disturbing and overthrowing thereby the seditious <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics in the name of the <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Lord Jesus Christ</a>, who, speaking by His apostle, says, "Forbearing one another in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;" <span class="stiki" id="note141599"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;4:2-3</a></span> and again, by the mouth of the same apostle, "If in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you," <span class="stiki" id="note141600"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> &mdash; we, I say, propose for consideration and discussion the opinions of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, without violating the bond of unity and peace with them, in maintaining which we imitate them so far as we can by the aid of the Lord Himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>11. C&aelig;cilius of Bilta  said: "I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> of one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the one Church and of none outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. The one will be where there is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> hope and sure <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For so it is written, 'One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one hope, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note141602"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse4">Ephesians&nbsp;4:4-5</a></span> Not among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, where there is no hope and a false <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; where all things are done by a <a href="../cathen/09469a.htm">lie</a>; where one possessed of a <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> exorcises; the question of the sacrament is asked by one from whose mouth and words proceeds a cancer; the faithless gives <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; the guilty gives pardon for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> and <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> baptizes in the name of Christ; one accursed of God blesses; the dead promises life; the unpeaceful gives peace; the blasphemer calls on <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; the profane administers the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>; the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> sets up the altar. To all this is added this further <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> that the servant of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> dares to celebrate the eucharist. If this be not so, let those who stand by them prove that all of it is false concerning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. See the kind of things to which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is compelled to assent, being forced to communicate without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. This, brethren, we ought to shun and avoid, separating ourselves from so great a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and holding to the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is granted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone." </p>

<p>12. To this I answer, that all who even within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> profess that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but deny Him in their <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, such as are the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, and those who, because they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> their brethren, are pronounced to be murderers, not on my testimony, but on that of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Apostle John, <span class="stiki" id="note141604"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:15</a></span> &mdash; all these are both devoid of hope, because they have a bad <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; and are faithless, because they do not do what they have vowed to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and liars, because they make false professions; and possessed of devils, because they give place in their heart to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>; and their words work corruption, since they corrupt good manners by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications; and they are infidels, because they laugh at the threats which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> utters against such men; and accursed, because they live wickedly; and antichrists, because their lives are opposed to Christ; and cursed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, since <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Scripture everywhere calls down curses on such men; and dead, because they are without the life of righteousness; and unpeaceful, because by their contrary <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> they are at variance with God's behests; and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a>, because by their abandoned acts despite is done to the name of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>; and profane, because they are spiritually shut out from that inner sanctuary of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a>, because by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life they defile the temple of God within themselves; and servants of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, because they do service to fraud and <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. That of such a kind are some, nay very many, even within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is testified both by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle and by Cyprian the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>. Why, then, do they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>? Why also are some, who "renounce the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without being converted from a life like this, and not rebaptized when they are converted? And as to what he says with such indignation, "See the kind of things to which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is compelled to assent, being forced to communicate without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>," he could never have used such expressions had there not been the other <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> who elsewhere forced men to such things. Whence also it is shown that at that time those men held the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> views who did not depart from the primitive custom, which is since confirmed by the consent of a general Council.  But what does he mean by adding, "This, brethren, we ought to shun and avoid, separating ourselves from so great a <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?" For if he means that he is not to do nor to approve of this, that is another matter; but if he means to condemn and sever from him those that hold the contrary opinion, he is setting himself against the earlier words of Cyprian, "Judging no man, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he differ from us."</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>13. The elder Felix  of Migirpa said: "I think that every one coming from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. For in vain does any one suppose that he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> there, seeing that there is no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> save the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for there is one Lord, and one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and one Church, in which rests the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>, and the rest. For the things that are practised without have no power to work <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>."</p>

<p>14. To what Felix of Migirpa said we answer as follows. If the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> did not exist except in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it surely would not exist in those who depart from unity. But it does exist in them, since they do not receive it when they return, simply because they had not lost it when they departed. But as regards his statement, that "the things that are practised without have no power to work <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>," I agree with him, and think that it is quite <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; for it is one thing that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> should not be there, and another that it should have no power to work <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. For when men come to the peace of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, then what was in them before they joined it, but did not profit them, begins at once to profit them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>15. To the declaration of Polycarp of Adrumetum,  that "those who declare the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to be valid, make ours of none effect," we answer, if that is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> which is given by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, then that is the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> and murderers which is given by them within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But if this be not their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, neither is the other the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and so it is Christ's, by whomsoever it be given.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>16. Novatus of Thamugadis  said: "Though we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that all Scripture gives its testimony respecting saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, yet we ought to express our belief that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with the semblance of having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the unfailing fountain; and that therefore, according to the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and according to the decree of those most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> men, our colleagues,  all schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who are converted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and that, moreover, all that seemed to have received ordination should be admitted as simple <a href="../cathen/08748a.htm">laymen</a>."</p>

<p>17. Novatus of Thamugadis has stated what he has done, but he has brought forward no <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proofs</a> by which to show that he ought to have acted as he did. For he has made mention of the testimony of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, and the decree of his colleagues, but he has not adduced out of them anything which we could consider.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>18. Nemesianus of Tubun&aelig;  said: "That the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is given by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> is everywhere declared in the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, inasmuch as their very prelates are false Christs and <a href="../cathen/07698b.htm">false prophets</a>, as the Lord declares by the mouth of Solomon, 'Whoso trusts in lies, the same feeds the winds; he also follows flying birds. For he deserts the ways of his own vineyard, and has strayed from the paths of his own field. For he walks through pathless and dry places, and a land destined to thirst; and he gathers fruitless weeds in his hands.'  And again, 'Abstain from strange water, and drink not of a strange fountain, that you may live long, and that years may be added to your life.'  And in the gospel <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> spoke with His own voice, saying, 'Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note141613"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> This is the Spirit which from the beginning 'moved upon the face of the waters.' <span class="stiki" id="note141614"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse2">Genesis&nbsp;1:2</a></span> For neither can the Spirit act without the water, nor the water without the Spirit. Ill, therefore, for themselves do some interpret, saying that by imposition of hands they receive the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, and are received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, when it is manifest that they ought to be born again by both <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For then indeed will they be able to become the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as the apostle says, 'Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, one God.' <span class="stiki" id="note141615"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;4:3-6</a></span> All this the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> asserts. And again he says in the gospel, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; for the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.'  Therefore all things whatsoever all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics do are carnal, as the apostle says, 'Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, <a href="../cathen/15674b.htm">witchcraft</a>, <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a>, variance, emulations, <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">wrath</a>, seditions, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note141617"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19-21</a></span> The apostle condemns, equally with all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, those also who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> divisions, that is, schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Unless therefore they receive that saving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is one, and found only in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they cannot be saved, but will be condemned with the carnal in the judgment of the Lord."</p>

<p>19. Nemesianus of Tubun&aelig; has advanced many passages of Scripture to prove his point; but he has in fact said much on behalf of the view of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which we have undertaken to set forth and maintain. Unless, indeed, we must suppose that he does not "trust in what is false" who trusts in the hope of things temporal, as do all <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> men and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, and those "who renounce the world in words but not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," of whom Cyprian yet bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that such men not only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but even are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.  For they themselves also "follow flying birds,"  since they do not attain to what they desire. But not only the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, but everyone who leads an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life "deserts the ways of his own vineyard, and has strayed from the paths of his own field. And he walks through pathless and dry places, and a land destined to thirst; and he gathers fruitless weeds in his hands;" because all <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a> is fruitful, and all iniquity is barren. Those, again, who "drink strange water out of a strange fountain," are found not only among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but among all who do not live according to the teaching of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and do live according to the teaching of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>. For if he were speaking of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he would not say, "Do not drink of a strange fountain," but, do not wash yourself in a strange fountain. Again, I do not see at all what aid he gets towards proving his point from the words of our Lord, "Unless a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he cannot enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141620"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse5">John&nbsp;3:5</a></span> For it is one thing to say that every one who shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a> is first born again of water and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, because except a man be born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, he shall not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which is the Lord's saying, and is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; another thing to say that every one who is born of water and the Spirit shall enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>, which is assuredly false. For <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a> also was born of water and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note141621"><a href="../bible/act008.htm#verse13">Acts&nbsp;8:13</a></span> and yet he did not enter into the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; and this may possibly be the case with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as well. Or if only those are born of the Spirit who are changed with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion, all "who renounce the world in word and not in deed" are assuredly not born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, but of water only, and yet they are within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, according to the testimony of Cyprian. For we must perforce grant one of two things&mdash;either those who renounce the world deceitfully are born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, though it is to their destruction, not to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, and therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may be so born; or if what is written, that "the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> of discipline will flee deceit," <span class="stiki" id="note141622"><a href="../bible/wis001.htm#verse5">Wisdom&nbsp;1:5</a></span> extends to proving as much as this, that those who renounce the world deceitfully are not born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, then a man may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with water, and not born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, and Nemesianus says in vain that neither the Spirit can work without the water, nor the water without the Spirit. Indeed it has been already often shown how it is possible that men should have one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in common who have not one Church, as it is possible that in the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself those who are sanctified by their righteousness, and those who are polluted through their <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, may not have the same one Spirit, and yet have the same one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For it is said "one body," that is, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just as it is said "one Spirit" and "one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>." The other arguments which he has adduced rather favor our position. For he has brought forward a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the gospel, in the words, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit; for the Spirit is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note141623"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;3:6</a></span> and he has advanced the argument that therefore all things that are done by any <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> or schismatic are carnal, as the apostle says, "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness;" and so he goes through the list which the apostle there enumerates, among which he has reckoned <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, since "they who do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141624"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19-21</a></span> Then he goes on to add, that "therefore the apostle condemns with all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> men those also who <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> division, that is, schismatics and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>." And in this he does well, that when he enumerates the works of the flesh, among which are also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, he found and declared that the apostle condemns them all alike. Let him therefore question the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyprian himself, and learn from him how many even within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> live according to the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> works of the flesh, which the apostle condemns in common with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, and yet these both <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Why then are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> alone said to be incapable of possessing <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which is possessed by the very partners in their condemnation?</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>20. Januarius of Lamb&aelig;se  said: "Following the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, I pronounce that all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and so admitted into the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church." </p>

<p>21. To him we answer, that, following the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, a universal Council of the whole world decreed that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not to be disavowed even when found among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But if he had brought forward any <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, we should have shown either that they were not against us, or even that they were for us, as we proceed to do with him who follows.</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>22. Lucius of Castra Galb&aelig;  said: "Since the Lord has said in His gospel, 'You are the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth: but if the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> have lost his savor, that which is salted from it shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.'  and seeing that again, after His <a href="../cathen/12789a.htm">resurrection</a>, when sending forth His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, He commanded them, saying, 'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: go ye therefore, and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>,' <span class="stiki" id="note141629"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;28:18-19</a></span> &mdash; since then it is plain that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that is, the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, have not the full confession of the sacrament, also that schismatics cannot reason with spiritual wisdom, since they themselves, by withdrawing when they have lost their savor from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is one, have become contrary to it,  let that be done which is written, 'The houses of those that are opposed to the law must needs be cleansed.'  and it therefore follows that those who have been polluted by being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by men opposed to Christ should first be cleansed, and only then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." </p>

<p>23. Lucius of Castra Galb&aelig; has brought forward a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the gospel, in the words of the Lord, "You are the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> of the earth: but if the <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a> have lost his savor, that which is salted from it shall be good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men;" just as though we maintained that men when cast out were of any profit for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> either of themselves or of any one else. But those also who, though seeming to be within, are yet of such a kind, not only are without spiritually, but will in the end be separated in the body also. For all such are for nothing. But it does not therefore follow that the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is in them is nothing. For even in the very men who are cast out, if they return to their senses and come back, the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which had departed from them returns; but the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does not return, because it never had departed. And in what the Lord says, "Go therefore, and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>," He did not permit any to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> except the good, inasmuch as He did not say to the bad, "Whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they are retained." <span class="stiki" id="note141633"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;20:23</a></span> How then do the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> within, who cannot remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? How also is it that they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> whose hearts are not changed, whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are yet upon them, as John says, "He that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is in darkness even until now?" <span class="stiki" id="note141634"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:9</a></span> But if the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of these men are remitted when they join themselves in the close bonds of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to the good and just, through whom <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, though they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, so the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of those also are remitted who come from without and join themselves by the inner bond of peace to the same framework of the body of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. Yet the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ should be acknowledged in both, and held invalid in none, whether before they are converted, though then it profit them nothing, or after they are converted, that so it may profit them, as he says, "Since they themselves, by withdrawing when they have lost their savor from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which is one, have become contrary to it, let that be done which is written, 'The houses of those that are opposed to the law must need be cleansed.' And it therefore follows," he goes on to say, "that those who have been polluted by being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by men opposed to Christ should first be cleansed, and only then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." What then? Are thieves and murderers not contrary to the law, which says, "You shall not kill; you shall not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">steal</a>?"  "They must therefore needs be cleansed." Who will deny it? And yet not only those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by such within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but also those who, being such themselves, are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without being changed in heart, are nevertheless exempt from further <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> when they are so changed. So great is the force of the sacrament of mere <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that though we allow that a man who has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and continues to lead an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> life requires to be cleansed, we yet forbid him to be any more <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p>24. Crescens of Cirta  said: "The letters of our most beloved Cyprian to Jubaianus, and also to Stephen,  having been read in so large an assembly of our most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, containing as they do so large a body of sacred testimony derived from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a> that give us our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,  that we have every reason to assent to them, being all united by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, I give my judgment that all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics who wish to come to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should not enter therein unless they have been first exorcised and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; with the obvious exception of those who have been originally <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, these being reconciled and admitted to the penance of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by the imposition of hands." </p>

<p>25. Here we are warned once more to inquire why he says, "Except, of course, those who have been originally <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." Is it because they had not lost what they had before received? Why then could they not also transmit outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> what they were able to possess outside? Is it that outside it is unlawfully transmitted? But neither is it lawfully possessed outside, and yet it is possessed; so it is unlawfully given outside, but yet it is given. But what is given to the person returning from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> inside, is given to the person coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside&mdash;that is, that he may have lawfully inside what before he had unlawfully outside. But perhaps some one may ask what was said on this point in the letter of the blessed Cyprian to Stephen, which is mentioned in this judgment, though not in the opening address to the Council,&mdash; I suppose because it was not considered necessary. For Crescens stated that the letter itself had been read in the assembly, which I have no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> was done, if I am not mistaken, as is customary, in order that the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, being already assembled, might receive some information at the same time on the subject contained in that letter. For it certainly has no bearing on the present subject; and I am more surprised at Crescens having thought fit to mention it at all, than at its having been passed over in the opening address. But if any one thinks that I have shrunk from bringing forward something which has been urged in it that is essential to the present point, let him read it and see that what I say is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; or if he finds it otherwise, let him convict me of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>. For that letter contains nothing whatsoever about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> administered among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics, which is the subject of our present argument. </p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>26. Nicomedes of Segermi  said: "My judgment is that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, because they can obtain no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> among sinners outside." </p>

<p>27. The answer to which is: The judgment of the whole <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, being already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, should not be rebaptized on coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For if there is no remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> among sinners, neither can sinners within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> remit <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; and yet those who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by them are not rebaptized.</p>

<p>29. To this we answer, That all who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the words of the gospel have the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the sacrament alone; but that in heart and in life neither do those have them who live an abandoned and accursed life within.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.</h2>

<p>30. Secundinus of Cedias  said: "Since our Lord Christ said, 'He that is not with me is against me,' <span class="stiki" id="note141649"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> and the Apostle John declares those who go out from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> to be antichrists, <span class="stiki" id="note141650"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse18">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:18</a></span> without all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> the enemies of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and those who are called antichrists, cannot minister the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which gives <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; and therefore my judgment is that those who take refuge in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> from the snares of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by us, who of His condescension are called the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>." </p>

<p>31. The answer to which is, That all are the opponents of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, to whom, on their saying, "Lord, have we not in Your name done many wonderful things?" with all the rest that is there recorded, He shall at the last day answer, "I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you: depart from me, you that work iniquity," <span class="stiki" id="note141652"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;7:22-23</a></span> &mdash; all which kind of chaff is destined for the fire, if it persevere to the last in its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, whether any part of it fly outside before its winnowing, or whether it seem to be within. If, therefore, those <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are to be again <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that they may be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, are those <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> men, those <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, murderers, the friends of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or must those whom they have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh?</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p>32. Felix of Bagai  said: "As when the blind leads the blind, both fall into the ditch, <span class="stiki" id="note141654"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;15:14</a></span> so when a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> baptizes a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, both fall together into death."</p>

<p>33. This is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but it does not follow that what he adds is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. "And therefore," he says, "the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> must be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and brought to life, lest we who are alive should hold communion with the dead."

Those then who were corrupted by their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications, and followed them, were not they likewise falling with them into the pit? And yet among them there were men to whom the apostle was writing as being already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; nor would they, therefore, if they were corrected, be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh. Does not the same apostle say, "To be carnally-minded is death?" <span class="stiki" id="note141657"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;8:6</a></span> and certainly the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, the deceivers, the <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, in the midst of whom Cyprian himself was groaning, were carnally-minded. What then? Did the dead hurt him who was living in unity? Or who would say, that because such men had or gave the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that it was therefore violated by their iniquities?</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.</h2>

<p>34. Polianus of Mileum  said: "It is right that a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church." </p>

<p>35. Nothing, indeed, could be expressed more shortly. But I think this too is short: It is right that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ should not be depreciated in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.</h2>

<p>36. Theogenes of Hippo Regius  said: "According to the sacrament of the heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God which we have received, we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the one only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church." </p>

<p>37. This may be my own judgment also. For it is so balanced, that it contains nothing contrary to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. For we also <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the one only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church. Had he said, indeed, We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in that which is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church alone, the same answer must have been made to him as to the rest. But as it is, since he has expressed himself in this wise, "We <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> in the one only <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church," so that it is asserted that it exists in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, but not denied that it may be elsewhere as well, whatever his meaning may have been, there is no need to argue against these words. For if I were questioned  on the several points, first, whether there was one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, I should answer that there was one. Then if I were asked, whether this was in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church, I should answer that it was. In the third place, if it were asked whether I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in this <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, I should answer that I did so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>; and consequently I should answer that I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> in the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church. But if it were asked whether it was found in the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Church alone, and not among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, I should answer that, in common with the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> the contrary. But since he did not insert this in his judgment, I should consider that it was mere wantonness if I added words which I did not find there, for the sake of arguing against them. For if he were to say, There is one water of the river Euphrates, which is in Paradise, no one could gainsay the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of what he said. But if he were asked whether that water were in Paradise and nowhere else, and were to say that this was so, he would be saying what was false. For, besides Paradise, it is also in those lands into which it flows from that source. But who is rash enough to say that he would have been likely to assert what is false, when it is quite possible that he was asserting what is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>? Wherefore the words of this judgment require no contradiction, because they in no wise run counter to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.</h2>

<p>38. Dativus of Badi&aelig;  said "We, so far as lies within our power, refuse to communicate with a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, unless he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and received remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." </p>

<p>39. The answer to this is: If your reason for wishing him to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is that he has not received remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, supposing you find a man within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, though entertaining <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards his brother, since the Lord cannot lie, who says, "If you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses," <span class="stiki" id="note141664"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;6:15</a></span> will you bid such an one, when corrected, to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh? Assuredly not; so neither should you bid the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>. It is clear that we must not pass unnoticed why he did not briefly say, "We do not communicate with a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>," but added, "so far as lies within our power." For he saw that a greater number agreed with this view, from whose communion, however, he and his friends could not separate themselves, lest unity should be impaired, and so he added, "so far as lies within our power,"&mdash; showing beyond all <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that he did not willingly communicate with those whom he held to be without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but that yet all things were to be endured for the sake of peace and unity; just as was done also by those who thought that Dativus and his party were in the wrong, and who held what afterwards was taught by a fuller declaration of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and urged by ancient custom, which received the stronger confirmation of a later Council; yet in turn, with anxious <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, they showed toleration towards each other, though without violation of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity they entertained different opinions, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace, <span class="stiki" id="note141665"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse3">Ephesians&nbsp;4:3</a></span> till God should reveal to one of them, were he otherwise minded, even this <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of his ways. <span class="stiki" id="note141666"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> And to this I would have those give heed, by whom unity is attacked on the authority of this very Council by which it is declared how much unity should be loved.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.</h2>

<p>40. Successus of Abbir Germaniciana  said: "Heretics may either do nothing or everything. If they can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, they can also give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; but if they cannot give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because they do not possess the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, then can they not either spiritually <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Therefore we give our judgment that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." </p>

<p>41. To this we may answer almost word for word: Murderers may either do nothing or everything. If they can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, they can also give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>; but if they cannot give the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, because they do not possess the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, then can they not either spiritually <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Therefore we give our judgment that <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by murderers, or murderers themselves who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without being converted, should, when they have corrected themselves, be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Yet this is not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>. For "whosoever <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer;" <span class="stiki" id="note141669"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:15</a></span> and Cyprian <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> such men within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who certainly <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>. Therefore it is to no purpose that words of this sort are used concerning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.</h2>

<p>42. Fortunatus of Thuccabori  said: "<a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the Father and Creator, built His Church upon a rock, not upon <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and gave the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, not to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Wherefore those who are outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and stand against <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, scattering His sheep and flock, cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> outside." </p>

<p>43. He added the word "outside" in order that he might not be answered with a like brevity to Successus. For otherwise he might also have been answered word for word: <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a> the Father and Creator, built His Church upon a rock, not upon iniquity, and gave the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> to <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a>, not to the unrighteous. Wherefore those who do not belong to the rock on which they build, who hear the word of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and do it, <span class="stiki" id="note141672"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;7:24</a></span> but, living contrary to Christ in hearing the word and not doing it, and hereby building on the sand, in this way scatter His sheep and flock by the example of an abandoned character, cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. Might not this be said with all the semblance of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>? And yet it is false. For the unrighteous do <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, since those <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> are unrighteous whom Cyprian maintained to be at unity with himself.  But for this reason, says the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a>, he adds "outside." Why therefore can they not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> outside? Is it because they are worse from the very fact that they are outside? But it makes no difference, in respect of the validity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, how much worse the minister may be. For there is not so much difference between bad and worse as between good and bad; and yet, when the bad baptizes, he gives the selfsame sacrament as the good. Therefore, also, when the worse baptizes, he gives the selfsame sacrament as the less bad. Or is it that it is not in respect of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man's</a> merit, but of the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> itself, that it cannot be given outside? If this were so, neither could it be possessed outside, and it would be necessary that a man should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again so often as he left the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and again returned to it.</p>

<p>44. Further, if we inquire more carefully what is meant by "outside," especially as he himself makes mention of the rock on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is built, are not they in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who are on the rock, and they who are not on the rock, not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> either? Now, therefore, let us see whether they build their house upon a rock who hear the words of Christ and do them not. The Lord Himself declares the contrary, saying, "Whosoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock;" and a little later, "Every one that hears these sayings of mine, and does them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand."  If, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is on a rock, those who are on the sand, because they are outside the rock, are necessarily outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Let us recollect, therefore, how many Cyprian mentions as placed within who build upon the sand, that is, who hear the words of Christ and do them not. And therefore, because they are on the sand, they are <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be outside the rock, that is, outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; yet even while they are so situated, and are either not yet or never changed for the better, not only do they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they have remains valid in them though they are destined to damnation.</p>

<p>45. Neither can it be said in this place,  Yet who is there that does all the words of the Lord which are written in the evangelic sermon itself,  at the end of which He says, that he who heard the said words and did them built upon a rock, and he who heard them and did them not built upon the sand? For, granting that by certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> all the words are not accomplished, yet in the same sermon He has appointed the remedy, saying, "Forgive, and you shall be forgiven." <span class="stiki" id="note141677"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse37">Luke&nbsp;6:37</a></span> And after the <a href="../cathen/09356a.htm">Lord's prayer</a> had been recorded in detail in the same sermon, He says, "For I say unto you, if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: but if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." <span class="stiki" id="note141678"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;6:14-15</a></span> Hence also Peter says, "For charity shall cover the multitude of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note141679"><a href="../bible/1pe004.htm#verse8">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;4:8</a></span> which charity they certainly did not have, and on this account they built upon the sand, of whom the same Cyprian says, that within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> they held conversation, even in the time of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, in unkindly <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> alien from <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> charity;  and therefore they seemed indeed to be within, but really were without, because they were not on that rock by which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is signified.</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.</h2>

<p>46. Sedatus of Tuburbo  said: "Inasmuch as water, sanctified by the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> of the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, washes away <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, just so much does it multiply <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> when infected, as by a cancer, with the words of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Wherefore one must strive, with all such efforts as conduce to peace, that no one who has been infected and tainted by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> should refuse to receive the one <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, with which whosoever is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>." </p>

<p>47. To this we answer, that if the water is not sanctified, when through want of skill the <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> who <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prays</a> utters some words of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, many, not only of the bad, but of the good brethren in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, fail to sanctify the water. For the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> of many are corrected every day on being recited to men of greater learning, and many things are found in them contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Supposing, then, that it were shown that some <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when these <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> had been uttered over the water, will they be bidden to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh? Why not? Because generally the fault in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is more than counterbalanced by the intent of him who offers it; and those fixed words of the gospel, without which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> cannot be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, are of such efficacy, that, by their <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, anything faulty that is uttered in the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> contrary to the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is made of no effect, just as the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is excluded by the name of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For it is clear that if a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> utters a faulty <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, he has no good intent of <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> whereby that want of skill may be compensated, and therefore he is like any <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> or spiteful person in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, such as Cyprian proves to exist within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Or one might offer some <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, as not unfrequently happens, in which he should speak against the rule of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, since many rush into the use of <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a> which are composed not only by unskillful men who <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> to talk, but even by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and in the simplicity of <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>, not being able to discern their <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> character, use them, thinking they are good; and yet what is erroneous in them does not vitiate what is right, but rather it is rendered null thereby, just as in the man of good hope and approved <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, who yet is but a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, if in anything he be otherwise minded, what he holds aright is not thereby vitiated until God reveal to him also that in which he is otherwise minded. <span class="stiki" id="note141683"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> But supposing that the man himself is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> and perverse, then, if he should offer an upright <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, in no part contrary to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, it does not follow that because the <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> is right the man himself is also right; and if over some he offer an erroneous <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>, God is present to uphold the words of His gospel, without which the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ cannot be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a>, and He Himself consecrates His sacrament, that in the recipient, either before he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, or when he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, or at some future time when he turns in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that very sacrament may be profitable to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, which, were he not to be converted, would be powerful to his destruction. But who is there who does not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is no <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, if the words of the gospel in which consists the outward visible sign be not forthcoming? But you will more easily find <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who do not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> at all, than any who <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> without those words. And therefore we say, not that every <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> (for in many of the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemous</a> <a href="../cathen/13064b.htm">rites</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> men are said to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>), but that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that is, every <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the words of the gospel, is everywhere the same, and cannot be vitiated by any perversity on the part of any men. </p>

<p>48. We must certainly not lightly pass over in this judgment that he here inserted a clause, and says, "Wherefore we must strive, with all such efforts as conduce to peace, that no one who has been infected," etc. For he had regard to those words of the blessed Cyprian in his opening speech, "Judging no man, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he entertain a different view." See of what power is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of unity and peace in the good sons of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that they should choose rather to show tolerance towards those whom they called <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> and profane, being admitted, as they thought, without the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, if they could not correct them as they thought was right, than on their account to break that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> bond, lest on account of the tares the wheat also should be rooted out, <span class="stiki" id="note141685"><a href="../bible/mat013.htm#verse29">Matthew&nbsp;13:29</a></span> &mdash; permitting, so far as rested with them, as in that noblest judgment of Solomon, that the infant body should rather be nourished by the false mother than be cut in pieces. <span class="stiki" id="note141686"><a href="../bible/1ki003.htm#verse26">1&nbsp;Kings&nbsp;3:26</a></span> But this was the opinion both of those who held the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truer</a> view about the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and of those to whom <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in consideration of their great <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, was purposing to reveal any point in which they were otherwise minded.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.</h2>

<p>49. Privatianus of Sufetula  said: "He who says that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> should first say who it was that founded <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>. For if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it may have the divine favor; but if it be not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how can it either have or confer on any one the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God?" </p>

<p>50. This man may thus be answered word for word: He who says that malicious and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> have the power of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a>, should first say who was the founder of <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a>. For if <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> are of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they may have the divine favor; but if they are not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, how can they either have or confer on any one the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of God? But as these words are in the same way most manifestly false, so are also those which these were uttered to confute. For the malicious and <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, as even Cyprian himself allows, because he bears testimony that they also are within. So therefore even <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, because <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is the sacrament of Christ; but <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> are the works of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>.

To this we answer: It is not the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> which we approve in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as it is not the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, or the treacherous, or deceitful, or of <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, or of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> men which we approve in them; for all of these are <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, but Christ is just, whose sacrament existing in them, they do not in its <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> violate. Otherwise another man might say: What can be said of the man who approves the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>, save that he communicates with the <a href="../cathen/08010c.htm">unjust</a>. And if this objection were brought against the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> herself, it would be answered just as I have answered the above.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.</h2>

<p>53. Hortensianus of Lares  said: "How many baptisms there are, let those who uphold or favor <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> determine. We assert one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which we only <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Or how can those <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> any one in the name of Christ whom Christ Himself declares to be His enemies?" </p>

<p>54. Giving answer to this man in a like tenor of words, we say: Let those who uphold or favor the unrighteous see to it: we recall to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> when we can the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone, wherever it be found. Or how can they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> any one in the name of Christ whom Christ Himself declares to be His enemies? For He says to all the unrighteous, "I never <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> you: depart from me, you that work iniquity;" <span class="stiki" id="note141693"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;7:23</a></span> and yet, when they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, it is not themselves that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, but He of whom John says, "The same is He which baptizes." <span class="stiki" id="note141694"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 29.</h2>

<p>55. Cassius of Macomades  said: "Since there cannot be two baptisms, he who grants <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> unto <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> takes it away from himself. I therefore declare my judgment that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, those objects for our tears, those masses of corruption,  should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when they begin to come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and that so being washed by the sacred and divine laver, and enlightened with the light of life, they may be received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>&mdash;as being now made not enemies, but peaceful; not strangers, but of the household of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord; not bastards,  but sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; partaking not of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, but of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>&mdash;with the exception of those who, being <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> transplanted from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, had gone over to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, and that these should be restored by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a>." </p>

<p>56. Another might say: Since there cannot be two baptisms, he who grants <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the unrighteous takes it away from himself. But even our opponents would join us in resisting such a man when he says that we grant <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> to the unrighteous, which is not of the unrighteous, like their unrighteousness, but of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, of whom is righteousness, and whose sacrament, even among the unrighteous, is not unrighteous. What, therefore, they would join us in saying of the unrighteous, that let them say to themselves of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. And therefore he should rather have said as follows: I therefore give my judgment that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, those objects for our tears, those masses of corruption, should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when they begin to come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, if they already have the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but should be corrected from their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. For we may similarly say of the unrighteous, of whom the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are a part: I therefore give my judgment that the unrighteous, those objects for our tears, and masses of corruption, if they have been already <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again when they begin to come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that is, to that rock outside which are all who hear the words of Christ and do them not; but being already washed with the sacred and divine laver, and now further enlightened with the light of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, should be received into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> no longer as enemies but as peaceful, for the unrighteous have no peace; no longer as strangers, but of the household of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of the Lord, for to the unrighteous it is said, "How then are you turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?" <span class="stiki" id="note141699"><a href="../bible/jer002.htm#verse21">Jeremiah&nbsp;2:21</a></span> no longer as bastards, but the sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, for the unrighteous are the sons of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, partaking not of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> but of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, for un-righteousness cannot save. And by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> I mean that rock, that dove, that garden enclosed and fountain sealed, which is recognized only in the wheat, not in the chaff, whether that be scattered far apart by the wind, or appear to be mingled with the grain even till the last winnowing. In vain, therefore, did Cassius add, "With the exception of those who, being <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> transplanted from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, had gone over to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>." For if even they themselves had lost <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> by seceding, to themselves also let it be restored; but if they had not lost it, let what was given by them receive due recognition.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30.</h2>

<p>57. Another Januarius of Vicus C&aelig;saris  said: "If <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> does not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, much more does <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> refuse assent to <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; and therefore we stand by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in which we preside, so that, claiming her <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for herself alone, we <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." </p>

<p>58. We answer: Whom the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> baptizes, those that rock baptizes outside which are all they who hear the words of Christ and do them not. Let all, therefore, be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again who have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by such. But if this is not done, then, as we recognize the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ in these, so should we recognize it in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, though we either condemn or correct their unrighteousness and <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31.</h2>

<p>59. Another Secundinus of Carpis  said: "Are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or not? If they are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, why are they not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church of God</a>? If they are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, let them be made so.  Else what will be the reference in the discourse of the Lord, in which He says, 'He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad?' <span class="stiki" id="note141704"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse30">Matthew&nbsp;12:30</a></span> Whence it is clear that on strange children and the offspring of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> cannot descend by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> alone, since it is clear that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>." </p>

<p>60. To this we answer: Are the unrighteous <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> or not? If they are <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, why are they not on that rock on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is built? For they hear the words of Christ and do them not. If they are not <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, let them be made so. Else what will be the reference in the discourse of our Lord, in which He says, "He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad?" For they scatter His sheep who lead them to the ruin of their lives by a false imitation of the Lord. Whence it is clear that upon strange children (as all the unrighteous are called), and upon the offspring of <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> (which all are who oppose themselves to Christ), the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> cannot descend by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> alone, if there be not added a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion of the heart; since it is clear that the unrighteous, so long as they are unrighteous, may indeed have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but cannot have the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of which <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is the sacrament. For let us see whether <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are described in that psalm where the following words are used of strange children: "Deliver me, O Lord, from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a>: whose sons are like young shoots well established, and their daughters polished after the similitude of the temple. Their garners are full, affording all manner of store; their sheep are fruitful, bringing forth plenteously in their streets; their oxen are strong: there is no breaking down of their fence, no opening of a passage out, no complaining in their streets. Men deemed <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a> the people that is in such a case; rather blessed is the people whose God is the Lord."  If, therefore, those are strange children who place their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> in temporal things, and in the abundance of earthly prosperity, and despise the commandments of the Lord, let us see whether these are not the very same of whom Cyprian so speaks, transforming them also into himself, that he may show that he is speaking of men with whom he held communion in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>: "In not keeping," he says, "the way of the Lord, nor observing the heavenly commandments given us for our <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. Our Lord did the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of His Father, and we do not do the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the Lord, being eager about our patrimony or our gains, following after <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and so forth."  But if these could both have and transmit <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, why is it denied that it may exist among strange children, whom he yet exhorts, that, by keeping the heavenly commandments conveyed to them through the only-begotten Son, they should deserve to be His brethren and the sons of God?</p>

<p>61. Victoricus of Thabraca  said: "If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, and give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, why do we destroy their credit, and call them <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>?" </p>

<p>62. What if another were to say: If the unrighteous may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, and give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, why do we destroy their credit, and call them unrighteous? The answer which we should give to such an one concerning the unrighteous may also be given to the other concerning <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>&mdash;that is, in the first place, that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> with which they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> is not theirs; and secondly, that it does not follow that whosoever has the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ is also certain of the remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if he has this only in the outward sign, and is not converted with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion of the heart, so that he who gives remission should himself have remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33.</h2>

<p>63. Another Felix of Uthina  said: "No one can <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, most <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> brethren in the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a>, that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> presumption has not so much power as the adorable and venerable majesty of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>. Remembering then the danger, we ought not only to observe this ourselves, but to confirm it by our general consent, that all <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who come to the bosom of our mother the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which has been polluted by long-continued corruption, may be reformed when cleansed by the sanctification of the laver." </p>

<p>64. Perhaps the man who has placed the strength of his case for the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in the cleansing away of the long-continued corruption, would spare those who, having fallen headlong into some <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, had remained in it a brief space, and presently being corrected, had passed from thence to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Furthermore, he has himself failed to observe that it might be said that all unrighteous <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who come to that rock, in which is understood the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, so that the unrighteous <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, which was building outside the rock upon the sand by hearing the words of Christ and not doing them, might be reformed when cleansed by the sanctification of the laver; and yet this is not done if they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> already, even if it be <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> that such was their character when they were <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that is, that they "renounced the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>."</p>

<h2>Chapter 34.</h2>

<p>65. Quietus of Burug  said: "We who live by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> ought with believing observance to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> what has been before foretold for our instruction. For it is written in Solomon, 'He that is washed by one dead, what avails his washing?'  Which assuredly he says of those who are washed by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and of those who wash. For if they who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among them receive <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life through the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, why do they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? But if no <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is received from a dead person, and they therefore, acknowledging their former <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, return with penance to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, they ought to be sanctified with the one life-giving <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which is in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." </p>

<p>66. What it is to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by the dead, we have already, without prejudice to the more careful consideration of the same scripture, sufficiently declared before.  But I would ask why it is that they wish <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> alone to be considered dead, when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle has said generally of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, "The wages of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is death;" <span class="stiki" id="note141716"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;6:23</a></span> and again, "To be carnally minded is death." <span class="stiki" id="note141717"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse6">Romans&nbsp;8:6</a></span> And when he says that a <a href="../cathen/15617c.htm">widow</a> that lives in pleasure is dead, <span class="stiki" id="note141718"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:6</a></span> how are they not dead "who renounce the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>"? What, therefore, is the profit of washing in him who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by them, except, indeed, that if he himself also is of the same character, he has the laver indeed, but it does not profit him to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? But if he by whom he is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is such, but the man who is <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> is turned to the Lord with no false heart, he is not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> by that dead person, but by that living One of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizes." <span class="stiki" id="note141719"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> But to what he says of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that if they who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among them receive <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> life through the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, why do they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? We answer: They come for this reason, that although they have received the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ up to the point of the celebration of the sacrament, yet they cannot attain to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> save through the charity of unity; just as neither would those <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and malicious ones attain to life <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a>, who would not have their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> forgiven them, even if they entertained <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> only against those from whom they suffered wrong; since the Truth said, "If you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses," <span class="stiki" id="note141720"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;6:15</a></span> how much less when they were hating those towards whom they were rewarding <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> for good?  And yet these men, though "renouncing the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," would not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, if they should afterwards be corrected, but they would be made <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> by the one living <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And this is indeed in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but not in it alone, as neither is it in the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> alone who are built upon the rock, and of whom that one dove is composed. <span class="stiki" id="note141722"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:9</a></span> </p>

If it was the custom, as this judgment bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> should be received with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they already had, either this was done rightly, or the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> do not pollute the good in unity. If it was rightly done, why do they accuse the world because they are so received? But if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> do not pollute the good in unity, how do they defend themselves against the charge of <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> separation?</p>

<h2>Chapter 36.</h2>

<p>69. Eucratius of Theni  said: "Our God and Lord <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, teaching the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> with His own mouth, fully laid down our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, and the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and the rule of the law of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, saying, 'Go, and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note141726"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> Therefore the false and unrighteous <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> is to be repudiated by us, and contradicted with all <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, seeing that from their mouth issues not life, but poison, not heavenly <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, but <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blaspheming</a> of the Trinity. And so it is plain that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with perfect and <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, that, being purified from the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> of their presumption, they may be reformed by the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>." </p>

<p>70. Clearly, if the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, it should be considered to be of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and repudiated as unrighteous by us with all <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>; but if we discern this name in it, we do better to distinguish the words of the gospel from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>, and approve what is sound in them, correcting what is faulty.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37.</h2>

<p>71. Libosus of Vaga  said: "The Lord says in the gospel, 'I am the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>;' <span class="stiki" id="note141729"><a href="../bible/joh014.htm#verse6">John&nbsp;14:6</a></span> He did not say, I am custom. Therefore, when the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is made manifest, let custom yield to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; so that, if even in time past any one did not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he may now begin to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> them." </p>

<p>72. Here he has in no way tried to show how that is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to which he says that custom ought to yield. But it is of more importance that he helps us against those who have separated themselves from unity, by confessing that the custom <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a>, than that he thinks it ought to yield to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> which he does not show. For the custom is of such a nature, that if it admitted <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> men to the altar of Christ without the cleansing of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and polluted none of the good men who remained in unity, then all who have cut themselves off from the same unity, in which they could not be polluted by the contagion of any <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whatsoever, have separated themselves without reason, and have committed the manifest sacrilege of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>. But if all perished in pollution through that custom, from what cavern do they issue without the original <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and with all the cunning of <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumny</a>? If, however, the custom was a right one by which <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> were thus received, let them abandon their <a href="../cathen/08041a.htm">madness</a>, let them confess their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>; let them come to the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, not that they may be bathed again with the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but that they may be cured from the wound of severance.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38.</h2>

<p>73. Lucius of Thebaste  said: "I declare my judgment that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemers</a>, and unrighteous men, who with various words pluck away the sacred and adorable words of the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, should be held accursed, and therefore exorcised and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." </p>

<p>74. I too think that they should be held accursed, but not that therefore they should be exorcised and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; for it is their own <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> which I hold accursed, but Christ's sacrament which I venerate.</p>

<h2>Chapter 39.</h2>

<p>75. Eugenius of Ammedera  said: "I too pronounce this same judgment, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." </p>

<p>76. To him we answer: But this is not the judgment which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> pronounces, to which also God has now revealed in a plenary Council the point in which you were then still otherwise minded, <span class="stiki" id="note141735"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> but because saving charity was in you, you remained in unity.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40.</h2>

<p>77. Also another Felix of Ammacura  said: "I too, following the authority of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, give my judgment that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and with them those also who maintain that they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among schismatics. For if, according to the warning of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, our fountain is sealed to ourselves, <span class="stiki" id="note141737"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse12">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:12</a></span> let all the enemies of our Church understand that it cannot belong to others; nor can He who is the Shepherd of our flock give the water unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to two different peoples. And therefore it is clear that neither <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> nor schismatics can receive anything heavenly, who dare to accept from men that are sinners and aliens from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. When the giver has no ground to stand upon, surely neither can the receiver derive any profit." </p>

<p>78. To him we answer, that the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a> nowhere have enjoined that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh, but that they have shown in many places that all are aliens from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> who are not on the rock, nor belong to the members of the dove, and yet that they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> and have the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> without <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>. But how our fountain is like the fountain of Paradise, in that, like it, it flows forth even beyond the bounds of Paradise, has been sufficiently set forth above;  and that "He who is the Shepherd of our flock cannot give the water unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to two different peoples," that is, to one that is His own, and to another that is alien, I fully agree in admitting. But does it follow that because the water is not unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> it is not the identical water? For the water of the deluge was for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> unto those who were placed within the ark, but it brought death to those without, and yet it was the same water. And many aliens, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, whom Cyprian declares and proves from Scripture to be of the party of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, seem as it were to be within, and yet, if they were not without the ark, they would not perish by water. For such men are slain by <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, as the sweet savor of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was unto death to those of whom the apostle speaks. <span class="stiki" id="note141740"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> Why then do not either <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics receive anything heavenly, just as thorns or tares, like those who were without the ark received indeed the rain from the floods of heaven, but to destruction, not to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>? And so I do not take the pains to refute what he said in conclusion: "When the giver has no ground to stand upon, surely neither can the receiver derive any profit," since we also say that it does not profit the receivers while they receive it in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, consenting with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; and therefore they come to <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> peace and unity, not that they may receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but that what they had received may begin to profit them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41.</h2>

<p>79. Also another Januarius of Muzuli  said: "I wonder that, while all acknowledge that there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, all do not understand the unity of the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> are two distinct things. If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> we have it not; but if we have it, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot have it. But there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone possesses the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since it alone possesses both the favor and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." </p>

<p>80. Another might equally say, and say with equal want of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>: I wonder that, while all confess there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, all do not understand the unity of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For righteousness and unrighteousness are two distinct things. If the unrighteous have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the righteous have it not; but if the righteous have it, the unrighteous cannot have it. But there is no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that the righteous alone possess the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, since they alone possess both the favor and the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. This is certainly false, as they confess themselves. For those <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> ones also who are of the party of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, though placed within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as Cyprian tells us, and who were well known to the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>, had <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but did not belong to the members of that dove which is safely sheltered on the rock.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42.</h2>

<p>81. Adelphius of Thasbalte  said: "It is surely without <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> that they find fault with the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in false and invidious terms, saying that we rebaptize, since the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not rebaptize <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but baptizes them." </p>

<p>82. Truly enough it does not rebaptize them, because it only baptizes those who were not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before; and this earlier custom has only been confirmed in a later Council by a more careful perfecting of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43.</h2>

<p>83. Demetrius of the Lesser Leptis  said: "We uphold one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because we claim for the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> alone what is her own. But those who say that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> and lawfully are themselves the men who make, not two, but many baptisms; for since <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are many in number, the baptisms, too, will be reckoned according to their number." </p>

<p>84. To him we answer: If this were so, then would as many baptisms be reckoned as there are works of the flesh, of which the apostle says "that they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>;" <span class="stiki" id="note141747"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse21">Galatians&nbsp;5:21</a></span> among which are reckoned also <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>; and so many of those very works are tolerated within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as though in the chaff, and yet there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> for them all, which is not vitiated by any work of unrighteousness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 44.</h2>

<p>85. Vincentius of Thibari  said: "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are worse than <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. If they, being converted, wish to come to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, they have assuredly a rule of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, which the Lord by His divine precept committed to the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, saying, 'Go, lay on hands in my name, cast out devils.' <span class="stiki" id="note141749"><a href="../bible/mar016.htm#verse15">Mark&nbsp;16:15-18</a></span> and in another place, 'Go, and teach all nations, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> them in the name of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son</a>, and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.' <span class="stiki" id="note141750"><a href="../bible/mat028.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;28:19</a></span> Therefore, first by the <a href="../cathen/07698a.htm">laying on of hands</a> in exorcism, secondly by regeneration in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, they may come to the promises of Christ; but my judgment is that in no other way should this be done." </p>

<p>86. By what rule he asserts that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are worse than <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> I do not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, seeing that the Lord says, "If he neglect to hear the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, let him be unto you as a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> man and a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141752"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;18:17</a></span> Is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> worse even than such? I do not gainsay it. I do not, however, allow that because the man himself is worse than a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, that is, than a Gentile and pagan, therefore whatever the sacrament contains that is Christ's is mingled with his <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vices</a> and character, and perishes through the corruption of such admixture. For if even those who depart from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and become not the followers but the founders of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a>, have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> before their secession, they continue to have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, although, according to the above rule, they are worse than <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>; for if on correction they return, they do not receive it, as they certainly would do if they had lost it. It is therefore possible that a man may be worse than a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, and yet that the sacrament of Christ may not only be in him, but be not a whit inferior to what it is in a <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and righteous man. For although to the extent of his powers he has not preserved the sacrament, but done it <a href="../cathen/15446a.htm">violence</a> in heart and will, yet so far as the sacrament's own nature is concerned, it has remained unhurt in its integrity even in the man who despised and rejected it. Were not the people of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, that is to say, <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>? The <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> therefore were worse, to whom the Lord says, "It shall be more tolerable for the land of <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> in the day of judgment than for you;" <span class="stiki" id="note141753"><a href="../bible/mat011.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;11:24</a></span> and to whom the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> says, "You have justified <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141754"><a href="../bible/eze016.htm#verse51">Ezekiel&nbsp;16:51</a></span> that is to say, in comparison with you <a href="../cathen/14130a.htm">Sodom</a> is righteous. Shall we, however, maintain that on this account the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> among the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> partook of the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> themselves&mdash;those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> which the Lord Himself also accepted, and sent the <a href="../cathen/09182a.htm">lepers</a> whom He had cleansed to fulfill them, <span class="stiki" id="note141755"><a href="../bible/luk017.htm#verse14">Luke&nbsp;17:14</a></span> of which when Zacharias was administering them, the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> stood by him, and declared that his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> had been heard while he was <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> in the temple?  These same <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were both in the good men of that time, and in those bad men who were worse than are the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, seeing that they were ranked before the Sodomites for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>, and yet those <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> were perfect and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> in both.</p>

<p>87. For even if the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> themselves could have anything <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> and right in their doctrines, our <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> did not condemn it, however much the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> themselves were to be detested for their <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">superstitions</a> and <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> and <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a>, and the rest of their corruptions, and to be punished with judgment from heaven unless they submitted to correction. For when <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle also was saying something concerning God before the <a href="../cathen/02043b.htm">Athenians</a>, he adduced as a <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> of what he said, that certain of them had said something to the same effect, <span class="stiki" id="note141757"><a href="../bible/act017.htm#verse28">Acts&nbsp;17:28</a></span> which certainly would not be condemned but recognized in them if they should come to <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyprian uses similar evidence against the same <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>; for, speaking of the <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">magi</a>, he says, "The chief of them, however, Hostanes, asserts both that the form of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God cannot be seen, and also that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> stand beside His seat. In which <a href="../cathen/12159a.htm">Plato</a> also agrees in like manner, and, maintaining the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he calls the others <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a> or <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Hermes Trismegistus also speaks of one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and confesses that He is incomprehensible, and past our powers of estimation."  If, therefore, they were to come to the perception of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, it surely would not be said to them, This that you have is bad, or false; but clearly it would deservedly be said, Though this in you is perfect and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, yet it would profit nothing unless ye came to the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. If, therefore, anything that is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> can be found and rightly approved in the very <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>, although the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> which is of Christ is not yet to be granted to them, we ought not, even though <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> are worse than they, to be moved to the desire of correcting what is bad in them belonging to themselves, without being willing to acknowledge what is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> in them of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. But we will set forth from a fresh preface to consider the remaining judgments of this Council.</p>
