<h1>On Baptism, Against the Donatists (Book VII)</h1>

<p><strong>In which the remaining judgments of the Council of Carthage are examined.</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>1. Let us not be considered troublesome to our readers, if we discuss the same question often and from different points of view. For although the Holy <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> throughout all nations be fortified by the authority of primitive custom and of a plenary Council against those arguments which throw some darkness over the question about <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, whether it can be the same among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics that it is in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, yet, since a different opinion has at one time been entertained in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, by men who are in no wise to be despised, and especially by Cyprian, whose authority men endeavor to use against us who are far removed from his charity, we are therefore compelled to make use of the opportunity of examining and considering all that we find on this subject in his Council and letters, in order, as it were, to handle at some considerable length this same question, and to show how it has more <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> been the decision of the whole body of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> or schismatics, who have received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> already in the body from which they came, should be admitted with it into the communion of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, being corrected in their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> and rooted and grounded in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, that, so far as concerns the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, there should not be an addition of something that was wanting, but a turning to profit of what was in them. And the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> Cyprian indeed, now that the corruptible body no longer presses down the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, nor the earthly tabernacle presses down the mind that muses upon many things, <span class="stiki" id="note141759"><a href="../bible/wis009.htm#verse15">Wisdom&nbsp;9:15</a></span> sees with greater clearness that <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> to which his charity made him deserving to attain. May he therefore help us by his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayers</a>, while we labor in the mortality of the flesh as in a darksome cloud, that if the Lord so grant it, we may imitate so far as we can the good that was in him. But if he thought otherwise than right on any point, and persuaded certain of his brethren and colleagues to entertain his views in a matter which he now sees clearly through the revelation of Him whom he loved, let us, who are far inferior to his merits, yet following, as our weakness will allow, the authority of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of which he was himself a conspicuous and most noble member, strive our utmost against <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, seeing that they, being cut off from the unity which he maintained, and barren of the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> with which he was fruitful, and fallen away from the humility in which he stood, are disavowed and condemned the more by him, in proportion as he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that they wish to search out his writings for purposes of treachery, and are unwilling to imitate what he did for the maintainance of peace&mdash;like those who, calling themselves Nazarene <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and circumcising the foreskin of their flesh after the fashion of the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a>, being <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by birth in that <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> from which Peter, when straying from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, was called by <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> <span class="stiki" id="note141760"><a href="../bible/gal002.htm#verse11">Galatians&nbsp;2:11</a></span> persist in the same to the present day. As therefore they have remained in their perversity cut off from the body of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, while Peter has been crowned in the primacy of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> through the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, so these men, while Cyprian, through the abundance of his <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, has been received into the portion of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> through the brightness of his passion, are <a href="../cathen/11189a.htm">obliged</a> to recognize themselves as exiles from unity, and, in defence of their <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumnies</a>, set up a citizen of unity as an opponent against the very home of unity. Let us, therefore, go on to examine the other judgments of that Council after the same fashion.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>2. Marcus of Mactaris  said: "It is not to be wondered at if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, being enemies and opponents of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, claim to themselves what has been entrusted and vouchsafed to other men. What is marvellous is that some of us, traitors to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, uphold <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and oppose <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>; therefore we decree that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." </p>

<p>3. To him we answer: It is indeed much more to be wondered at, and deserving of expressions of great praise, that Cyprian and his colleagues had such <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for unity that they continued in unity with those whom they considered to be traitors to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, without any apprehension of being polluted by them. For when Marcus said, "It is marvellous that some of us, traitors to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, uphold <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and oppose <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>," it seemed natural that he should add, Therefore we decree that communion should not be held with them. This he did not say; but what he does say is, "Therefore we decree that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>," adhering to what the peaceful Cyprian had enjoined in the first instance, saying, "Judging no man, nor removing any from the right of communion if he entertain a different opinion." While, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> us and call us <em> traditors</em>, I should be glad to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, supposing that any Jew or pagan were found, who, after reading the records of that Council should call both us and them, according to their own rules, traitors to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, how we should be able to make our joint defense so as to refute and wash away so grave a charge. They give the name of <em>traditors</em> to men whom they were never able in times past to convict of the offense, and whom they cannot now show to be involved in it, being themselves rather shown to be liable to the same charge. But what has this to do with us? What shall we say of them who, by their own showing, are unquestionably traitors? For if we, however <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a>, are called <em>traditors</em>, because, as they allege, we took part in the same communion with <em>traditors</em>, we have all taken part with the <em>traditors</em> in question, seeing that in the time of the blessed Cyprian the party of Donatus had not yet separated itself from unity. For the delivery of the sacred books, from which they began to be called <em>traditors</em>, occurred somewhat more than forty years after his <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>. If, therefore, we are <em> traditors</em>, because we sprang from <em>traditors</em>, as they <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> or pretend, we both of us derive our origin from those other traitors. For there is no room for saying that they did not communicate with these traitors, since they call them men of their own party. In the words of the Council which they are most forward to quote, "Some of us," it declares, "traitors to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, uphold <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>." To this is added the testimony of Cyprian, showing clearly that he remained in communion with them, when he says, "Judging no man, nor removing any from the right of communion if he entertain a different opinion." For those who entertained a different opinion were the very <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> whom Marcus calls traitors to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> because they upheld <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, as he maintains, by receiving them into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. That it was, moreover, the custom that they should be so received, is testified both by Cyprian himself in many passages, and by some <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> in this Council. Whence it is evident that, if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> of those days was full of traitors, who upheld them by receiving them in this way. I would urge, therefore, that we plead our <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> in common against the charge of treason which they cannot disavow, and therein our special case will be argued against the charge of delivering the books, which they could not prove against us. But let us argue the point as though they had convicted us; and what we shall answer jointly to those who urge against both of us the general treason of our forefathers, that we will answer to these men who urge against us that our forefathers gave up the sacred books. For as we were dead because our forefathers delivered up the books, which caused them to divide themselves from us, so both we and they themselves are dead through the treason of our forefathers, from whom both we and they are sprung. But since they say they live, they hold that that treason does not in any way affect them, therefore neither are we affected by the delivery of the books. And it should be observed that, according to them, the treason is indisputable: while, according to us, there is no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> either in the former charge of treason, because we say that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also may have the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ; nor in the latter charge of delivering the books, because in that they were themselves beaten. They have therefore no reason for separating themselves by the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, because, if our forefathers were not guilty of delivering up the books, as we say, there is no charge which can affect us at all; but if they were guilty of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as these men say, then it is just as far from affecting us as the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of those other traitors is from affecting either us or them. And hence, since there is no charge that can implicate us from the unrighteousness of our forefathers, the charge arising against them from their own <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> is manifestly <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>4. Satius of Sicilibba  said: "If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> receive forgiveness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in their own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, it is without reason that they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For since it is for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that men are punished in the day of judgment, <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have nothing to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in the judgment of Christ if they have obtained remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>." </p>

<p>5. This too might also have been our own judgment; but let its author beware in what spirit it was said. For it is expressed in terms of such import, that I should feel no compunction in consenting and subscribing to it in the same spirit in which I too <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may indeed have the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but cannot have the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But he does not say, If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> or are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, but "If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>," he says, "receive forgiveness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in their own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, it is without reason that they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." For if we were to set in the place of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> those whom Cyprian <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as "renouncing the world in words alone and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," we also might express this same judgment, in just so many words, with the most perfect <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>. If those who only seem to be converted receive forgiveness of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in their own <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, it is without reason that they are afterwards led on to a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> conversion. For since it is for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> that men are punished in the day of judgment, "those who renounce the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>" have nothing to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> in the judgment of Christ if they have obtained remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. But this reasoning is only made perfect by some such context as is formed by the addition of the words. But they ought to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the judgment of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and to lose no time in being converted in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of their hearts; and, when they have done this, it is certainly not necessary that they should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> a second time. It was possible, therefore, for them to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and either not to receive remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, or to be burdened again at once with the load of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which were forgiven them; and so the same is the case also with the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>6. Victor of Gor  said: "Seeing that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are forgiven only in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he who admits <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to communion without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is guilty of two <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> contrary to reason; for, on the one hand, he does not cleanse the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and, on the other, he defiles the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>." </p>

<p>7. To this we answer that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exists even among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, though they themselves are not within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; just as the water of Paradise was found in the land of <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>, though that land was not itself in Paradise. We do not therefore admit <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to communion without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; and since they come with their waywardness corrected, we receive not their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. And, in respect of the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, we say again here exactly what we said above. And certainly, in regard of what he says at the end of his judgment, declaring that he "is guilty of two <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> contrary to reason, seeing that on the one hand he does not cleanse the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, and on the other he defiles the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>," Cyprian himself is the first and the most earnest in repudiating this with the colleagues who agreed with him. For neither did he think that he was defiled, when, on account of the bond of peace, he decreed that it was right to hold communion with such men, when he used the words, "Judging no one, nor removing any from the right of communion if he entertain a different opinion." Or, if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> defile the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by being admitted to communion without being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, then the whole <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has been defiled in virtue of that custom which has been so often recorded here. And just as those men call us <em>traditors</em> because of our forefathers, in whom they were able to prove nothing of the sort when they laid the charge against them, so, if every man partakes of the character of those with whom he may have held communion, all were then made <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. And if every one who asserts this is mad, it must be false that Victor says, when he declares that "he who admits <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to communion without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, not only fails to cleanse the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but pollutes the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> as well." Or if this be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, they were then not admitted without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but those men had the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, although it was given and received among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who were so admitted in accordance with that custom which these very men acknowledged to exist; and on the same grounds they are even now rightly admitted in the same manner.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>8. Aurelius of Utica  said: "Since the apostle says that we ought not to be partakers with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of other men, <span class="stiki" id="note141768"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:22</a></span> what else does he do but make himself partaker with the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of other men, who holds communion with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? And therefore I pronounce my judgment that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, that they may receive remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, and so communion be allowed to them." </p>

<p>9. The answer is: Therefore Cyprian and all those <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishops</a> were partakers in the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of other men, inasmuch as they remained in communion with such men, when they removed no one from the right of communion who entertained a different opinion. Where, then, is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Then, to say nothing for the moment of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>&mdash;since the words of this judgment are applicable also to other sinners, such as Cyprian saw with lamentation to be in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> with him, whom, while he confuted them, he yet tolerated&mdash;where is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which, according to these words must be held to have perished from that very moment by the contagion of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>? But if, as is the most firmly established <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> both has remained and does remain, the partaking of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of others, which is forbidden by the apostle, must be considered only to consist in consenting to them. But let <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, that they may receive remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, if the wayward and the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again, who, seeing that "they renounced the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," were indeed able to receive <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but did not obtain remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, as the Lord says, "If you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses." <span class="stiki" id="note141770"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse15">Matthew&nbsp;6:15</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>10. Iambus of Germaniciana  said: "Those who approve the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> disapprove ours, so as to deny that such as are, I will not say washed, but defiled outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." </p>

<p>11. To him we answer, that none of our party approves the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but all the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, even though it be found in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who are as it were chaff outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as it may be found in other unrighteous men who are as chaff within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For if those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> without the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> are not washed, but defiled, assuredly those who are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the rock on which the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is built are not washed, but defiled. But all are without the said rock who hear the words of Christ and do them not. Or if it be the case that they are washed indeed in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but yet continue in the defilement of their unrighteousness, from which they were unwilling to be changed for the better, the same is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> also of the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>12. Lucianus of Rucuma  said: "It is written, 'And God saw the light that it was <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, and God divided the light from the darkness.' <span class="stiki" id="note141774"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse4">Genesis&nbsp;1:4</a></span> If light and darkness can agree, then can there be something in common between us and <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Therefore I give my judgment that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." </p>

<p>13. To him the answer is: If light and darkness can agree, then can there be something common between the righteous and unrighteous. Let him therefore declare his judgment that those unrighteous should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> afresh whom Cyprian confuted within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself; or let him who can say if those are not unrighteous "who renounce the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>."</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>14. Pelagianus of Luperciana  said: "It is written, 'Either the Lord is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or <a href="../cathen/02175a.htm">Baal</a> is <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.'  So now either the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Further, if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> be not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, how can the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exist among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>?" </p>

<p>15. To him we may answer as follows: Either Paradise is Paradise, or <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> is Paradise. Further, if <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> be not Paradise, how can the water of Paradise be in <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a>? But it will be said to us that it extends even there by flowing forth from Paradise. In like manner, therefore, <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> extends to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. Also we say: Either the rock is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or the sand is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. Further, since the sand is not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, how can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exist with those who build upon the sand by hearing the words of Christ and doing them not? <span class="stiki" id="note141779"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;7:24-27</a></span> And yet it does exist with them; and in like manner also it exists among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>16. Jader of Midila  said: "We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that there is but one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and therefore we ought not to admit a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> unless he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in our body, lest he should think that he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." </p>

<p>17. To him our answer is, that if this were said of those unrighteous men who are outside the rock, it certainly would be <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsely</a> said. And so it is therefore also in the case of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10.</h2>

<p>18. Likewise another Felix of Marazana  said: "There is one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note141783"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse5">Ephesians&nbsp;4:5</a></span> but of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, to which alone is given authority to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>." </p>

<p>19. What if another were to say as follows: One <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but of the righteous only, to whom alone authority is given to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>? As these words might be refuted, so also may the judgment of Felix be refuted. Do even the unrighteous who are not  changed in heart in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, while "they renounce the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>" yet belong to the members of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Let them consider whether such a Church is the actual rock, the very dove, the bride herself without spot or wrinkle. </p>

<h2>Chapter 11.</h2>

<p>20. Paul of Bobba  said: "I for my part am not moved if some fail to uphold the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, seeing that the apostle says 'For what if some did not <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>? Shall their unbelief make the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> of God without effect? God forbid: yea let God be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, but every man a liar.' <span class="stiki" id="note141788"><a href="../bible/rom003.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;3:3-4</a></span> But if God be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, how can the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> be in the company of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, where God is not?" </p>

<p>21. To him we answer: What is God among the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>? And yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists among them; and so also it exists among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. For they among whom God is, are the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. "But what agreement has the temple of God with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>?" <span class="stiki" id="note141790"><a href="../bible/2co006.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;6:16</a></span> Further, <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> considers, and Cyprian agrees with him, that <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; and Cyprian himself again associates with his colleagues, who were <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, but yet <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, with great reward of toleration.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12.</h2>

<p>22. Pomponius of Dionysiana  said: "It is manifest that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> and give remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, seeing that no power is given to them that they should be able either to loose or bind anything on earth." </p>

<p>23. The answer is: This power is not given to murderers either, that is, to those who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> their brothers. For it was not said to such as these, "whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whosesoever <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> ye retain, they are retained." <span class="stiki" id="note141793"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse23">John&nbsp;20:23</a></span> And yet they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, and both <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> tolerates them in the same communion of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, and Cyprian acknowledges them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.</h2>

<p>24. Venantius of Tinisa  said: "If a husband, going on a journey into foreign countries, had entrusted the guardianship of his wife to a friend, he would surely keep her that was entrusted to his care with the utmost diligence, that her <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> and <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> might not be defiled by any one. Christ our Lord and <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when going to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, committed His bride to our care: do we keep her uncorrupt and undefiled, or do we betray her purity and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> to adulterers and corrupters? For he who makes the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ common with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> betrays the bride of Christ to adulterers." </p>

<p>25. We answer: What of those who, when they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, turn themselves to the Lord with their lips and not with their heart? Do not they possess an adulterous mind? Are not they themselves lovers of the world, which they renounce in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>; and they corrupt good manners through <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> communications, saying, "Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die?"  Did not the discourse of the apostle take heed even against such as these, when he says, "But I <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds [also] should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ?" <span class="stiki" id="note141797"><a href="../bible/2co011.htm#verse3">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> When, therefore, Cyprian held the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ to be in common with such men, did he therefore betray the bride of Christ into the hands of adulterers, or did he not rather recognize the necklace of the Bridegroom even on an adulteress?</p>

<h2>Chapter 14.</h2>

<p>26. Aymnius  of Ausuaga  said: "We have received one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which same also we administer; but he who says that authority is given to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, the same makes two baptisms." </p> 

<p>27. To him we answer: Why does not he also make two baptisms who maintains that the unrighteous also can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>? For although the righteous and unrighteous are in themselves opposed to one another, yet the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which the righteous give, such as was <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, or such as was also Cyprian, is not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which those unrighteous men were wont to give who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hated</a> <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a>, whom Cyprian understands to have been not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, but bad <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; and although the moderation which was found in Cyprian, and the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> which was found in his colleagues, are in themselves opposed to one another, yet the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which Cyprian used to give was not contrary to the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which his colleagues who opposed him used to give, but one and the same with it, because in both cases it is He that baptizes of whom it is said, "The same is He which baptizes." <span class="stiki" id="note141801"><a href="../bible/joh001.htm#verse33">John&nbsp;1:33</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 15.</h2>

<p>28. Saturninus of Victoriana  said: "If <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> may <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, they are excused and defended in doing unlawful things; nor do I see why either Christ called them His adversaries, or the apostle called them antichrists." </p>

<p>29. To him we answer: We say that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have no authority to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in the same sense in which we say that defrauders have no authority to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. For not only to the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, but to the sinner, God says, "What have you to do to declare my statutes, or that you should take my covenant in your mouth?" To the same person He assuredly says, "When you saw a thief, then you consented with him."  How much worse, therefore, are those who did not consent with thieves, but themselves were wont to plunder farms with treacherous deceits? Yet Cyprian did not consent with them, though he did tolerate them in the grain-field of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, lest the wheat should be rooted out together with it. And yet at the same time the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which they themselves conferred was the very selfsame <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, because it was not of them, but of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. As therefore they, although the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ be recognized in them, were yet not excused and defended in doing unlawful things, and Christ rightly called those His adversaries who were destined, by persevering in such things, to hear the doom, "Depart from me, you that work iniquity," <span class="stiki" id="note141805"><a href="../bible/mat007.htm#verse23">Matthew&nbsp;7:23</a></span> whence also they are called antichrists, because they are contrary to Christ while they live in opposition to His words, so likewise is it the case with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16.</h2>

<p>30. Another Saturninus of Tucca  said: "The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, although they worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, yet acknowledge and confess the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father and Creator. Against Him <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a> blasphemes, and some men do not blush to approve the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/09645c.htm">Marcion</a>.  How do such <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a> either maintain or vindicate the <a href="../cathen/12409a.htm">priesthood</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who do not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the enemies of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and hold communion with them while they are thus unbaptized?" </p>

<p>31. The answer is this: Truly when such terms as this are used, all moderation is passed; nor do they take into consideration that even they themselves hold communion with such men, "judging no one, nor removing any from the right of communion if he entertain a contrary opinion." But Saturninus has used an argument in this very judgment of his, which might furnish materials for his admonition (if he would pay attention to it), that in each man what is wrong should be corrected, and what is right should be approved, since he says, "The <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a>, although they worship <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, yet acknowledge and confess the supreme <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Father and Creator." If, then, any Gentile of such a kind should come to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, would he wish to correct and change this point in him, that he acknowledged and confessed <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father and Creator? I trow not. But he would amend in him his <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, which was an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> in him; and he would give to him the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which he did not possess; and anything that was wayward which he found in him he would correct; and anything which had been wanting he would supply. So also in the Marcionist <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> he would acknowledge the perfectness of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, he would correct his waywardness, he would teach him <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17.</h2>

<p>32. Marcellus of Zama  said: "Since <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are remitted only in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, he who does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> holds communion with a sinner." </p>

<p>33. What, does he who holds communion with one who does this not hold communion with a sinner? But what else did all of them do, "in judging no one, or removing from the right of communion any one who entertained a different opinion"? Where, then, is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? Are those things not an obstacle to those who are patient, and tolerate the tares lest the wheat should be rooted out together with them? I would have them therefore say, who have committed the sacrilege of <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> by separating themselves from the whole world, how it comes that they have in their mouths the judgment of Cyprian, while they do not have in their hearts the patience of Cyprian. But to this Marcellus we have an answer in what has been said above concerning <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, explaining how there can be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in a man although there be in him no remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18.</h2>

<p>34. <a href="../cathen/08130b.htm">Iren&aelig;us</a> of Ululi  said: "If the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>, because it is said that he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> already, then <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is the greater." </p>

<p>35. The answer is: On the same principle it might be said, If therefore the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> does not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, because it is said that he has been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> already, then <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is the greater. But this is false, therefore the other is also false.</p>

<h2>Chapter 19.</h2>

<p>36. Donatus of Cibaliana  said: "I acknowledge one Church, and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> that appertains thereto. If there is any one who says that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> exists among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, he must first show and prove that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exists with them." </p>

<p>37. To him we answer: If you say that the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is identical with <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, then it exists among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>; but if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is the sacrament or outward sign of <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, while the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> itself is the abolition of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, then the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> does not exist with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. But so there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> and one Church, just as there is one <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. As therefore the good and bad, not having one hope, can yet have one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, so those who have not one common Church can have one common <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20.</h2>

<p>38. Zozimus of Tharassa  said: "When a revelation has been made of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> must give way to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; inasmuch as Peter also, who before was wont to circumcise, gave way to <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> when he declared the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>." </p>

<p>39. The answer is: This may also be considered as the expression of our judgment too, and this is just what has been done in respect of this question of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. For after that the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> had been more clearly revealed, <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> gave way to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, when that most wholesome custom was further confirmed by the authority of a plenary Council. It is well, however, that they so constantly bear in mind that it was possible even for Peter, the chief of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, to have been at one time minded otherwise than the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> required; which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, without any disrespect to Cyprian, to have been the case with him, and that with all our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for Cyprian, for it is not right that he should be loved with greater <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> than Peter.</p>

<h2>Chapter 21.</h2>

<p>40. Julianus of Telepte  said: "It is written, 'A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.' <span class="stiki" id="note141818"><a href="../bible/joh003.htm#verse27">John&nbsp;3:27</a></span> if <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> is from heaven, it can give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>." </p>

<p>41. Let him hear another also saying: If <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is from heaven, it can give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And yet the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> do confer it; so therefore also may the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22.</h2>

<p>42. Faustus of Timida Regia  said: "Let not these <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> flatter themselves who favor <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>. He who interferes with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on behalf of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> makes them <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, and us <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>." </p>

<p>43. To him we answer: If any one were to say that a man who, when he received <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> had not received remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, because he entertained <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> towards his brother in his heart, was nevertheless not to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again when he dismissed that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> from his heart, does such a man interfere with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> on behalf of murderers, or does he make them righteous and us murderers? Let him therefore understand the same also in the case of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 23.</h2>

<p>44. Geminius of Furni  said: "Certain of our colleagues may prefer <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to themselves, they cannot prefer them to us: and therefore what we have once decreed we hold, that we should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> those who come to us from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>." </p> 

<p>45. This man also acknowledges most openly that certain of his colleagues entertained opinions contrary to his own: whence again and again the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of unity is confirmed, because they were separated from one another by no <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, till God should reveal to one or other of them anything wherein they were otherwise minded. <span class="stiki" id="note141824"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> But to him our answer is, that his colleagues did not prefer <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to themselves, but that, as the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ is acknowledged in the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, in the fraudulent, in <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>, in murderers, so also they acknowledged it in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.</h2>

<p>46. Rogatianus of Nova  said: "Christ established the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>: how can the <a href="../cathen/14379b.htm">synagogue</a> of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> have the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ?" </p>

<p>47. To him our answer is: Is it <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that because Christ established the well-affectioned, and the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, therefore the party of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, which is <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> to be among the <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a>, cannot have the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ?</p>

<h2>Chapter 25.</h2>

<p>48. Therapius of Bulla  said: "If a man gives up and betrays the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, what else can he be said to be but a Judas to the Bride of Christ?" </p>

<p>49. How great a condemnation have we here of all schismatics, who have separated themselves by <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> sacrilege from the inheritance of Christ dispersed throughout the whole world, if Cyprian held communion with such as was the traitor Judas, and yet was not defiled by them; or if he was defiled, then were all made such as Judas; or if they were not, then the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a> of those who went before do not belong to those who came after even though they were the offspring of the same communion. Why, therefore, do they cast in our teeth the <em>traditores</em>, against whom they did not prove their charge, and do not cast in their own teeth Judas, with whom Cyprian and his colleagues held communion? Behold the Council in which these men are wont to boast! We indeed say, that he who approves the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ even in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, does not betray to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ; just in the same way as he does not betray to murderers the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ who approves the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of Christ even in murderers: but inasmuch as they profess to prescribe to us from the decrees of this Council what opinions we ought to hold, let them first assent to it themselves. See how therein were compared to the traitor Judas, all who said that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, although <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>, should not be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> again. Yet with such Cyprian was willing to hold communion, when he said, "Judging no man, nor depriving any of the right of communion if he entertain a contrary opinion." But that there had been men of such a sort in former times within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is made clear by the sentence in which he says: "But some one will say, What, then, shall be done with these men who in times past were admitted into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>?"  That such had been the custom of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, is testified again and again by the very men who compose this Council. If, therefore, any one who does this "can be said to be nothing else but a Judas to the Bride of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>," according to the terms in which the judgment of Therapius is couched; but Judas, according to the teaching of the gospel, was a traitor; then all those men held communion with traitors who at that time uttered those very judgments, and before they uttered them they all had become traitors through that custom which at that time was retained by the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. All, therefore&mdash; that is to say, both we and they themselves who were the offspring of that unity&mdash; are traitors. But we defend ourselves in two ways: first, because without prejudice to the right of unity, as Cyprian himself declared in his opening speech, we do not assent to the decrees of this Council in which this judgment was pronounced; and secondly, because we hold that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> in no way hurt the good in <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> unity, until at the last the chaff be separated from the wheat. But our opponents, inasmuch as they both shelter themselves as it were under the decrees of this Council, and maintain that the good perish as by a kind of infection from communion with the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a>, have no resource to save them from allowing both that the earlier <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, whose offspring they are, were traitors, inasmuch as they are convicted by their own Council; and that the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of those who went before them do reflect on them, since they throw in our teeth the <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> of our ancestors.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.</h2>

<p>50. Also another Lucius of Membresa  said: "It is written, 'God hears not sinners.' <span class="stiki" id="note141831"><a href="../bible/joh009.htm#verse31">John&nbsp;9:31</a></span> How can he who is a sinner be heard in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>?" </p>

<p>51. We answer: How is the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man heard, or the robber, and usurer, and murderer? Are they not sinners? And yet Cyprian, while he finds fault with them in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, yet tolerates them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27.</h2>

<p>52. Also another Felix of Buslaceni  said: "In admitting <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> without <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, let no one place custom before reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; for reason and <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> always exclude custom." </p>

<p>53. To him our answer is: You do not show the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>; you confess the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> of the custom. We should therefore do right in maintaining the custom which has since been confirmed by a plenary Council, even if the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> were still concealed, which we <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> to have been already made manifest.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28.</h2>

<p>54. Another Saturninus of Abitini  said: "If <a href="../cathen/01559a.htm">Antichrist</a> can give to any one the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then can <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, who are called Antichrists." </p>

<p>55. What if another were to say, If a murderer can give the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, then can they also <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> that <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> their brethren who are called murderers? For certainly he would seem in a way to speak the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, and yet they can <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>; in like manner, therefore, can the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as well.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29.</h2>

<p>56. Quintus of Aggya  said: "He who has a thing can give it; but what can the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> give, who are well known to have nothing?" </p>

<p>57. To him our answer is: If, then, any man can give a thing who has it, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> can give <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>: for when they separate from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, they have still the sacrament of washing which they had received while in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; for when they return they do not again receive it, because they had not lost it when they withdrew from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30.</h2>

<p>58. Another Julianus of Marcelliana  said: "If a man can serve two masters, God and <a href="../cathen/09580b.htm">mammon</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note141840"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse24">Matthew&nbsp;6:24</a></span> then <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> also can serve two, the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>." </p>

<p>59. Truly, if it can serve the self-restrained and the <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a> man, the sober and the drunken, the well-affectioned and the murderer, why should it not also serve the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> and the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a>?&mdash; whom, indeed, it does not really serve; but it ministers to them, and is administered by them, for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> to those who use it right, and for judgment to such as use it wrong.</p>

<h2>Chapter 31.</h2>

<p>60. Tenax of Horrea Celi&aelig;  said: "There is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not, there <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> also cannot be." </p>

<p>61. To him we answer: How then comes it that it may be where the rock is not, but only sand; seeing that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is on the rock, and not on sand?</p>

<h2>Chapter 32.</h2>

<p>62. Another Victor of Assuras  said: "It is written, that 'there is one God and one Christ, one Church and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.'  How then can any one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> in a place where there is not either <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, or Christ, or the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>?" </p>

<p>63. How can any one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> either in that sand, where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is not, seeing that it is on the rock; nor God and <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, seeing that there is not there the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and Christ?</p>

<h2>Chapter 33.</h2>

<p>64. Donatulus of Capse  said: "I also have always entertained this opinion, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who have gained nothing outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> when they are converted to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." </p>

<p>65. To this the answer is: They have, indeed, gained nothing outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, but that is nothing towards <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, not nothing towards the sacrament. For <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> is peculiar to the good; but the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> are common to the good and bad alike.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34.</h2>

<p>66. Verulus of Rusiccade  said: "A man that is a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> cannot give that which he has not; much more is this the case with a schismatic, who has lost what he had." </p>

<p>67. We have already shown that they still have it, because they do not lose it when they separate themselves. For they do not receive  it again when they return: wherefore, if it was thought that they could not give it because they were supposed not to have it, let it now be understood that they can give it, because it is understood that they also have it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 35.</h2>

<p>68. Pudentianus of Cuiculi  said: "My recent ordination to the <a href="../cathen/05001a.htm">episcopate</a> induced me, brethren, to wait and hear what my elders would decide. For it is plain that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> have and can have nothing; and so, if any come from them, it is determined righteously that they should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." </p>

<p>69. As, therefore, we have already answered those who went before, for whose judgment this man was waiting, so be it understood that we have answered himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36.</h2>

<p>70. Peter of Hippo Diarrhytus  said: "Since there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, it is clear that a man cannot be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; and therefore I give my judgment, that those who have been bathed in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or in <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> ought to be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> on coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." </p>

<p>71. There is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in such a sense that, when any have gone out from it, it does not become two in those who go out, but remains one and the same. What, therefore, is recognized in those who return, should also be recognized in those who received it from men who have separated themselves, since they did not lose it when they went apart into <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 37.</h2>

<p>72. Likewise another Lucius of Ausafa  said: "According to the motion of my mind and of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, since there is <a href="../cathen/10499a.htm">one God</a>, the Father of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and one Christ, and one hope, one Spirit, one Church, there ought also to be only one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>. And therefore I say, both that if anything has been set on foot or done among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, that it ought to be rescinded; and also, that they who come out from among the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> should be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." </p>

<p>73. Let it therefore be pronounced of no effect that they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>, who hear the words of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> and do them not, when they shall begin to pass from unrighteousness to righteousness, that is, from the sand to the rock. And if this is not done, because what there was in them of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> was not violated by their unrighteousness, then let this also be understood in the case of <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>: for neither is there the same hope in the unrighteous, so long as they are on the sand, as there is in those who are upon the rock; and yet there is in both the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, although as it is said that there is one hope, so also is it said that there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38.</h2>

<p>74. Felix of Gurgites  said: "I give my judgment, that, according to the precepts of the <a href="../bible/index.html">holy Scriptures</a>, those who have been unlawfully <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, if they wish to flee to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, should obtain the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> where it is lawfully given." </p>

<p>75. Our answer is: Let them indeed begin to have in a lawful manner to <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> what they before had unlawfully to destruction; because each man is justified under the same <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, when he has turned himself to God with a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> heart, as that under which he was condemned, when on receiving it he "renounced the world in words alone, and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>."</p>

<h2>Chapter 39.</h2>

<p>76. Pusillus of Lamasba  said: "I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> except within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.

<p>77. This indeed is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, that "<a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> except within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." For in itself it can indeed exist outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> as well; but there it is not unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, because there it does not work <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>; just as that sweet savor of Christ is certainly not unto <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> in them that perish, <span class="stiki" id="note141861"><a href="../bible/2co002.htm#verse15">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;2:15</a></span> though from a fault not in itself, but in them. But "whatsoever is without the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is mere pretense," yet only in so far as it is not <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. But there may be something <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, just as the name of Christ could exist outside the congregation of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in which name he who did not follow with the <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> was casting out devils. <span class="stiki" id="note141862"><a href="../bible/mar009.htm#verse38">Mark&nbsp;9:38</a></span> For there may be pretense also within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, as is unquestionable in the case of those "who renounce the world in words and not in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>," and yet the pretense is not <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>. As, therefore, there is in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> something which is not <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a>, so there may be something which is <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> outside the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40.</h2>

<p>78. Salvianus of Gazaufala  said: "It is generally <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have nothing; and therefore they come to us, that they may receive what previously they did not have." </p>

<p>79. Our answer is: On this theory, the very men who founded <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> are not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> themselves, because they separated themselves from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and certainly they previously had what they received there. But if it is absurd to say that those are not <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> through whom the rest became <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, it is therefore possible that a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> should have what turns to his destruction through his <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> use of it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 41.</h2>

<p>80. Honoratus of Tucca  said: "Since Christ is the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, we ought to follow the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> rather than custom; that we may sanctify by the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> who come to us, simply because they could receive nothing outside." </p>

<p>81. This man, too, is a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> to the custom, in which he gives us the greatest assistance, whatever else he may appear to say against us. But this is not the reason why <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> come over to us, because they have received nothing outside, but that what they did receive may begin to be of use to them: for this it could not be outside in any wise.</p>

<h2>Chapter 42.</h2>

<p>82. Victor of Octavus  said: "As ye yourselves also <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, I have not been long appointed a <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, and therefore I waited for the counsel of my seniors. This therefore I express as my opinion, that whosoever comes from <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> should undoubtedly be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>." </p>

<p>83. What, therefore, has been answered to those for whom he waited, may be taken as the answer also to himself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 43.</h2>

<p>84. Clarus of Mascula  said: "The sentence of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a> is manifest, when He sent forth His <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and gave the power which had been given Him of His Father to them alone, whose successors we are, governing the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of the Lord with the same power, and <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptizing</a> those who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. And therefore <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who, being without, have neither power nor the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, cannot <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> any one with His <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>." </p>

<p>85. Are, then, ill-affectioned murderers successors of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>? Why, then, do they <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>? Is it because they are not outside? But they are outside the rock, to which the Lord gave the keys, and on which He said that He would build His <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note141871"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18-19</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 44.</h2>

<p>86. Secundianus of Thambei  said: "We ought not to deceive <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> by our too great forwardness, that not having been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">our Lord Jesus Christ</a>, and having therefore not received remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, they may not impute to us, when the day of judgment comes, that we have been the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of their not being <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, and not having obtained the indulgence of the <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. On which account, since there is one Church and one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, when they are converted to us, let them receive together with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> also of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." </p>

<p>87. Nay, when they are transferred to the rock, and joined to the society of the Dove, let them receive the remission of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, which they could not have outside the rock and outside the Dove, whether they were openly without, like the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, or apparently within, like the abandoned <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholics</a>; of whom, however, it is clear that they both have and confer <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, when even from themselves it is received by men, who, being not changed for the better, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> God with their lips, while their heart is far from Him. <span class="stiki" id="note141874"><a href="../bible/isa029.htm#verse13">Isaiah&nbsp;29:13</a></span> Yet it is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that there is one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, just as there is one Dove, though those who are not in the one communion of the Dove may yet have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> in common.</p>

<h2>Chapter 45.</h2>

<p>88. Also another Aurelius of Chullabi  said: "The Apostle John has laid down in his epistle the following precept: 'If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed: for he that bids him God speed is partaker of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>.'  How can such men be admitted without consideration into the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, who are forbidden to be admitted into our private house? Or how can we hold communion with them without the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when, if we only so much as bid them God speed, we are partakers of their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">evil deeds</a>?" </p>

<p>89. In respect of this testimony of John there is no need of further disputation, since it has no reference at all to the question of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, which we are at present discussing. For he says, "If any come unto you, and bring not the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>." But <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> leaving the doctrine of their <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> are converted to the doctrine of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that they may be incorporated with the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and may begin to belong to the members of that Dove whose sacrament they previously had; and therefore what previously they lacked belonging to it is given to them, that is to say, peace and charity out of a pure heart, and of a good <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>, and of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfeigned. <span class="stiki" id="note141878"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:5</a></span> But what they previously had belonging to the Dove is acknowledged, and received without any depreciation; just as in the adulteress God recognises His gifts, even when she is following her lovers; because when after her fornication is corrected she is turned again to <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, those gifts are not laid to her charge, but she herself is corrected. <span class="stiki" id="note141879"><a href="../bible/hos002.htm">Hosea&nbsp;ii</a></span> But just as Cyprian might have defended himself if this testimony of John had been cast in his teeth while he was holding communion with men like these, so let those against whom it is spoken make their own defense. For to the question before us, as I said before, it has no reference at all. For John says that we are not to bid God speed to men of strange doctrine; but <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Paul</a> the apostle says, with even greater vehemence, "If any man that is called a brother be <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetous</a>, or a drunkard," or anything of the sort, with such an one no not to eat; <span class="stiki" id="note141880"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse11">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:11</a></span> and yet Cyprian used to admit to fellowship, not with his private table, but with the altar of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, his colleagues who were <a href="../cathen/15235c.htm">usurers</a>, and treacherous, and fraudulent, and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a>. But in what manner this may be defended has been sufficiently set forth in other books already.</p>

<h2>Chapter 46.</h2>

<p>90. Litteus  of Gemelli  said: "'If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.' <span class="stiki" id="note141883"><a href="../bible/mat015.htm#verse14">Matthew&nbsp;15:14</a></span> Since, therefore, it is clear that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> can give no light  to any one, as being blind themselves, therefore their <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is invalid." </p>

<p>91. Neither do we say that it is valid for <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> so long as they are <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, just as it is of no value to those murderers of whom we spoke, so long as they <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> their brethren: for they also themselves are in darkness, and if any one follows them they fall together into the ditch; and yet it does not follow that they either have not <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> or are unable to confer it.</p>

<h2>Chapter 47.</h2>

<p>92. Natalis of O&euml;a  said: "It is not only I myself who am present, but also Pompeius of Sabrati,  and Dioga of Leptis Magna,  who commissioned me to represent their views, being absent indeed in body, but present in spirit, who deliver this same judgment as our colleagues, that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> cannot have communion with us, unless they have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." </p>

<p>93. He means, I suppose, that communion which belongs to the society of the Dove; for in the partaking of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a> they doubtless held communion with them, judging no man, nor removing any from the right of communion if he held a different opinion. But with whatever reference he spoke, there is no great need for these words being refuted. For certainly a <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretic</a> would not be admitted to communion, unless he had been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. But it is clear that the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> exists even among <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> if it be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> with the words of the gospel; just as the gospel itself belongs to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and has nothing to do with their waywardness, but certainly retains its own <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 48.</h2>

<p>94. Junius of Neapolis  said: "I do not depart from the judgment which we once pronounced, that we should <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> on their coming to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>." </p>

<p>95. Since this man has adduced no argument nor <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, he need not detain us long.</p>

<h2>Chapter 49.</h2>

<p>96. <a href="../cathen/04583b.htm">Cyprian of Carthage</a> said: "My opinion has been set forth with the greatest fullness in the letter which has been written to our colleague Jubaianus,  that <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> being called enemies of Christ and antichrists according to the testimony of the gospel and the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, should, when they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, be <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> with the one <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, that from enemies they may be made friends, and that from antichrists they may be made <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>." </p> 

<p>97. What need is there of further disputation here, seeing that we have already handled with the utmost care that very epistle to Jubaianus of which he has made mention? And as to what he has said here, let us not forget that it might be said of all unrighteous men who, as he himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a>, are in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and whose power of possessing and of conferring <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is not questioned by any of us. For they come to the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, who pass to Christ from the party of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and build upon the rock, and are incorporated with the Dove, and are placed in security in the garden enclosed and fountain sealed; where none of those are found who live contrary to the precepts of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, wherever they may seem to be. For in the epistle which he wrote to Magnus, while discussing this very question, he himself warned us at sufficient length, and in no ambiguous terms, of what kind of society we should understand that the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> consists. For he says, in speaking of a certain man, "Let him become an alien and profane, an enemy to the peace and unity of the Lord, not dwelling in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that is to say, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in which none dwell save those who are of one heart and of one mind."  Let those, therefore, who would lay injunctions on us on the authority of Cyprian, pay attention for a time to what we here say. For if only those who are of one heart and of one mind dwell in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, beyond all question those were not dwelling in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, however much they might appear to be within, who of <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envy</a> and contention were announcing Christ without charity; by whom he understands, not the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics who are mentioned by the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a>,  but false brethren holding conversation with him within, who certainly ought not to have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>, because they were not dwelling in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, in which he himself says that none dwell save those who are of one heart and of one mind: unless, indeed, any one be so far removed from the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> as to say that those were of one heart and of one mind who were <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> and malevolent, and contentious without charity; and yet they used to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>: nor did the detestable waywardness which they displayed in any degree violate or diminish from the sacrament of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, which was handled and dispensed by them.</p>

<h2>Chapter 50.</h2>

<p>98. It is indeed worth while to consider the whole of the passage in the aforesaid letter to Magnus, which he has put together as follows: "Not dwelling," he says, "in the house of God&mdash; that is to say, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash; in which none dwell save those that are of one heart and of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, as the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> says in the <a href="../cathen/12533a.htm">Psalms</a>, speaking of 'God that makes men to be of one mind in an house.'  Finally, the very <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of the Lord declare that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> are united among themselves by a firm and inseparable <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> for one another. For when the Lord calls bread, which is compacted together by the union of many grains, His body, <span class="stiki" id="note141897"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse51">John&nbsp;6:51</a></span> He is signifying one people, whom He bore, compacted into one body; and when He calls wine, which is pressed out from a multitude of branches and clusters and brought together into one, His blood, <span class="stiki" id="note141898"><a href="../bible/mat026.htm#verse26">Matthew&nbsp;26:26-29</a></span> He also signifies one flock joined together by the mingling of a multitude united into one." These words of the blessed Cyprian show that he both understood and loved the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which house he asserted to consist of those who are of one heart and of one <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, proving it by the testimony of the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophets</a> and the meaning of the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, and in which house certainly were not found those <a href="../cathen/08326b.htm">envious</a> <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, those malevolent without charity, who nevertheless used to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a>. From whence it is clear that the sacrament of Christ can both be in and be administered by those who are not in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, in which Cyprian himself bears <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> that there are none dwelling save those who are of one heart and of one mind. Nor can it indeed be said that they are allowed to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptize</a> so long as they are undetected, seeing that the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> did not fail to detect those of whose ministry he bears unquestionable testimony in his epistle, saying that he rejoices that they also were proclaiming Christ. For he says of them, "Whether in pretense or in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, Christ is preached; and I therein do <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, yea, and will <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141899"><a href="../bible/phi001.htm#verse18">Philippians&nbsp;1:18</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 51.</h2>

<p>99. Taking all these things, therefore, into consideration, I think that I am not rash in saying that there are some in the house of God after such a fashion as not to be themselves the very house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is said to be built upon a rock, <span class="stiki" id="note141900"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse18">Matthew&nbsp;16:18</a></span> which is called the one dove, <span class="stiki" id="note141901"><a href="../bible/son006.htm#verse9">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;6:9</a></span> which is styled the beauteous bride without spot or wrinkle,  and a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed, a well of living water, an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits; <span class="stiki" id="note141903"><a href="../bible/son004.htm#verse12">Song&nbsp;of&nbsp;Songs&nbsp;4:12-13</a></span> which house also received the keys, and the power of binding and loosing. <span class="stiki" id="note141904"><a href="../bible/mat016.htm#verse19">Matthew&nbsp;16:19</a></span> If any one shall neglect this house when it arrests and corrects him, the Lord says, "Let him be unto you as an <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> man and a <a href="../cathen/12553d.htm">publican</a>." <span class="stiki" id="note141905"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse17">Matthew&nbsp;18:17</a></span> Of this house it is said, "Lord, I have loved the habitation of Your house, and the place where Your <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a> dwells;"  and, "He makes men to be of one mind in an house;"  and, "I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord;"  and, "Blessed are they that dwell in Your house, O Lord; they will be still praising You;"  with countless other passages to the same effect. This house is also called wheat, bringing forth fruit with patience, some thirty-fold, some sixtyfold, and some an hundredfold.  This house is also in vessels of gold and of silver, <span class="stiki" id="note141911"><a href="../bible/2ti002.htm#verse20">2&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;2:20</a></span> and in precious stones and imperishable woods. To this house it is said, "Forbearing one another in <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>, endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace;" <span class="stiki" id="note141912"><a href="../bible/eph004.htm#verse2">Ephesians&nbsp;4:2-3</a></span> and, "For the temple of God is <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a>, which temple you are." <span class="stiki" id="note141913"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse17">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:17</a></span> For this house is composed of those that are good and faithful, and of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> servants of God dispersed throughout the world, and bound together by the unity of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, whether they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> each other personally or not. But we hold that others are said to be in the house after such a sort, that they belong not to the substance of the house, nor to the society of fruitful and peaceful <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justice</a>, but only as the chaff is said to be among the grain; for that they are in the house we cannot deny, when the apostle says, "But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honor</a>, and some to dishonor."  Of this countless multitude are found to be not only the crowd which within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> afflicts the hearts of the <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a>, who are so few in comparison with so vast a host, but also the <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresies</a> and schisms which exist in those who have burst the meshes of the net, and may now be said to be rather out of the house than in the house, of whom it is said, "They went out from us, but they were not of us." <span class="stiki" id="note141915"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> For they are more thoroughly separated, now that they are also divided from us in the body, than are those who live within the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> in a carnal and worldly fashion, and are separated from us in the spirit.</p>

<h2>Chapter 52.</h2>

<p>100. Of all these several classes, then, no one doubts respecting those first, who are in the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such a sense as themselves to be the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, whether they be already spiritual, or as yet only babes nurtured with milk, but still making progress with earnestness of heart, towards that which is spiritual, that such men both have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> so as to be of profit to themselves, and transmit it to those who follow their example so as to benefit them; but that in its transmission to those who are false, whom the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> shuns, though they themselves, so far as lies with them, confer it so as to be of profit, yet the others receive it in vain, since they do not imitate those from whom they receive it. But they who are in the great house after the fashion of vessels to dishonor, both have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without profit to themselves, and transmit it without profit to those who follow their example: those, however, receive it with profit, who are united in heart and character, not to their ministers, but to the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. But those who are more thoroughly separated, so as to be rather out of the house than in the house, have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> without any profit to themselves; and, moreover, there is no profit to those who receive it from them, unless they be compelled by urgent necessity to receive it, and their heart in receiving it does not depart from the bond of unity: yet nevertheless they possess it, though the possession be of no avail; and it is received from them, even when it is of no profit to those who so receive it, though, in order that it may become of use, they must depart from their <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>, and cleave to that house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. And this ought to be done, not only by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> and schismatics, but also by those who are in the house through communion in the <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, yet so as to be outside the house through the perversity of their character. For so the sacrament begins to be of profit even to themselves, which previously was of no avail.</p>

<h2>Chapter 53.</h2>

<p>101. The question is also commonly raised, whether <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is to be held valid which is received from one who had not himself received it, if, from some promptings of curiosity, he had chanced to learn how it ought to be conferred; and whether it makes no difference in what spirit the recipient receives it, whether in mockery or in sincerity: if in mockery, whether the difference arises when the mockery is of deceit, as in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or in what is thought to be the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; or when it is in jest, as in a play: and which is the more accursed, to receive it deceitfully in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a> without deceit, that is to say, with full sincerity of heart: or whether it be worse to receive it deceitfully in <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heresy</a> or in good <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> in a play, if any one were to be moved by a sudden feeling of religion in the midst of his acting. And yet, if we compare such an one even with him who receives it deceitfully in the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, I should be surprised if any one were to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> which of the two should be preferred; for I do not see of what avail the intention of him who gives in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> can be to him who receives deceitfully. But let us consider, in the case of some one also giving it in deceit, when both the given and the recipient are acting deceitfully in the unity of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, whether this should rather be acknowledged as <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, or that which is given in a play, if any one should be found who received it faithfully from a sudden impulse of religion: or whether it be not <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> that, so far as the men themselves are concerned, there is a very great difference between the believing recipient in a play, and the mocking recipient in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; but that in regard to the genuineness of the sacrament there is no difference. For if it makes no difference in respect to the genuineness of the sacrament within the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> itself, whether certain <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> celebrate it in <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> or in deceit, so long as both still celebrate the same thing, I cannot see why it should make a difference outside, seeing that he who receives it is not cloaked by his deceit, but he is changed by his religious impulse. Or have those truthful <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> among whom it is celebrated more power for the confirmation of the sacrament, than those deceitful men by whom and in whom it is celebrated can exert for its invalidation? And yet, if the deceit be subsequently brought to light, no one seeks a repetition of the sacrament; but the fraud is either punished by excommunication or set right by penitence.</p>

<p>102. But the safe course for us is, not to advance with any rashness of judgment in setting forth a view which has neither been started in any regionary Council of the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> nor established in a plenary one; but to assert, with all the confidence of a voice that cannot be gainsaid, what has been confirmed by the consent of the universal Church, under the direction of our Lord God and Saviour <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. Nevertheless, if any one were to press me&mdash; supposing I were duly seated in a Council in which a question were raised on points like these&mdash; to declare what my own opinion was, without reference to the previously expressed views of others, whose judgment I would rather follow, if I were under the influence of the same feelings as led me to assert what I have said before, I should have no hesitation in saying that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> possess <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who have received it in any place, from any sort of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, provided that it were <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in the words of the gospel, and received without deceit on their part with some degree of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>; although it would be of no profit to them for the <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a> of their <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a> if they were without charity, by which they might be grafted into the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>. For "though I have <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>," says the apostle, "so that I could remove mountains, but have not charity, I am nothing." <span class="stiki" id="note141916"><a href="../bible/1co013.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;13:2</a></span> Just as already, from the established decrees of our predecessors, I have no hesitation in saying that all those have <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> who, though they receive it deceitfully, yet receive it in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, or where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is thought to be by those in whose society it is received, of whom it was said, "They went out from us." <span class="stiki" id="note141917"><a href="../bible/1jo002.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;2:19</a></span> But when there was no society of those who so <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>, and when the man who received it did not himself hold such belief, but the whole thing was done as a farce, or a comedy, or a jest&mdash;if I were asked whether the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> which was thus conferred should be approved, I should declare my opinion that we ought to <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> for the declaration of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>'s judgment through the medium of some revelation seeking it with united <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> and earnest groanings of suppliant devotion, humbly deferring all the time to the decision of those who were to give their judgment after me, in case they should set forth anything as already <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> and determined. And, therefore, how much the more must I be considered to have given my opinion now without prejudice to the utterance of more diligent research or authority higher than my own!</p>

<h2>Chapter 54.</h2>

<p>103. But now I think that it is fully time for me to bring to their due termination these books also on the subject of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, in which our Lord God has shown to us, through the words of the peaceful Bishop Cyprian and his brethren who agreed with him, how great is the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> which should be felt for catholic unity; so that even where they were otherwise minded until God should reveal even this to them, <span class="stiki" id="note141918"><a href="../bible/phi003.htm#verse15">Philippians&nbsp;3:15</a></span> they should rather bear with those who thought differently from themselves, than sever themselves from them by a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> <a href="../cathen/13529a.htm">schism</a>; whereby the mouths of the <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatists</a> are wholly closed, even if we say nothing of the followers of Maximian. For if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> pollute the good in unity, then even Cyprian himself already found no Church to which he could be joined. But if the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> do not infect the good in unity, then the <a href="../cathen/13321a.htm">sacrilegious</a> <a href="../cathen/05121a.htm">Donatist</a> has no ground to set before himself for separation. But if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is both possessed and transferred by the multitude of others who work the works of the flesh, of which it is said, that "they which do such things shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>," <span class="stiki" id="note141919"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse19">Galatians&nbsp;5:19-21</a></span> then it is possessed and transferred also by <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who are numbered among those works; because they could have transferred it had they remained, and did not lose it by their secession. But men of this kind confer it on their fellows as fruitlessly and uselessly as the others who resemble them, inasmuch as they shall not inherit the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of God</a>. And as, when those others are brought into the right path, it is not that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> begins to be present, having been absent before, but that it begins to profit them, having been already in them; so is it the case with <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> as well. Whence Cyprian and those who thought with him could not impose limits on the <a href="../cathen/03449a.htm">Catholic</a> <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which they would not mutilate. But in that they were otherwise minded we feel no <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>, seeing that we too share in their veneration for Peter; yet in that they did not depart from unity we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, seeing that we, like them, are founded on the rock.</p>
