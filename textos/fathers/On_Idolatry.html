<h1>On Idolatry</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1. Wide Scope of the Word Idolatry</h2>

<p>The principal crime of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, the highest guilt charged upon the world, the whole procuring <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of judgment, is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.  For, although each single fault retains its own proper feature, although it is destined to judgment under its own proper name also, yet it is marked off under the <em>general</em> account of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Set aside names, examine works, the idolater is likewise a murderer. Do you inquire whom he has slain? If it contributes ought to the aggravation of the indictment, no stranger nor personal enemy, but his own self. By what snares? Those of his <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. By what weapon? The offense done to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. By how many blows? As many as are his idolatries. He who affirms that the idolater <em>perishes not</em>,  will affirm that the idolater has not committed <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. Further, you may recognize in the same crime  <em><a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a></em> and <em>fornication</em>; for he who serves false gods is doubtless an <em>adulterer</em>  of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, because all <a href="../cathen/05781a.htm">falsehood</a> is <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. So, too, he is sunk in fornication. For who that is a fellow-worker with unclean spirits, does not stalk in general pollution and fornication? And thus it is that the <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scriptures</a>  use the designation of fornication in their upbraiding of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. The <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of <em>fraud</em>, I take it, is, that any should seize what is another's, or refuse to another his due; and, of course, fraud done toward <em>man</em> is a name of greatest crime. Well, but <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> does fraud to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, by refusing to Him, and conferring on others, His honours; so that to fraud it also conjoins <em>contumely</em>. But if fraud, just as much as fornication and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, entails death, then, in these cases, equally with the former, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> stands unacquitted of the impeachment of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a>. After such crimes, so pernicious, so devouring of <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>, all other crimes also, after some manner, and separately disposed in order, find their own <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> represented in <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. In it also are the <em>concupiscences</em> of the world. For what <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is without the circumstance of dress and ornament? In it are <em>lasciviousnesses</em> and <em>drunkennesses</em>; since it is, for the most part, for the sake of food, and stomach, and appetite, that these solemnities are frequented. In it is <em>unrighteousness</em>. For what more unrighteous than it, which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> not the Father of righteousness? In it also is <em>vanity</em>, since its whole system is vain. In it is <em>mendacity</em>, for its whole substance is false. Thus it comes to pass, that in <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> all crimes are detected, and in all crimes <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Even otherwise, since all faults savour of opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and there is nothing which savours of opposition to God which is not assigned to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and unclean spirits, whose property <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> are; doubtless, whoever commits a fault is chargeable with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, for he does that which pertains to the proprietors of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. Idolatry in Its More Limited Sense. Its Copiousness</h2>

<p>But let the universal names of crimes withdraw to the specialities of their own works; let <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> remain in that which it is itself. Sufficient to itself is a name so inimical to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, a substance of crime so copious, which reaches forth so many branches, diffuses so many veins, that from this <em>name</em>, for the greatest part, is drawn the material of all the modes in which the expansiveness of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> has to be foreguarded against by us, since in manifold wise it subverts the servants of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and this not only when unperceived, but also when cloaked over. Most men simply regard <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> as to be interpreted in these senses alone, viz.: if one burn <a href="../cathen/07716a.htm">incense</a>, or immolate <em>a victim</em>, or give a sacrificial banquet, or be bound to some sacred functions or priesthoods; just as if one were to regard <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> as to be accounted in kisses, and in embraces, and in actual fleshly contact; or <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> as to be reckoned only in the shedding forth of blood, and in the actual taking away of life. But how far wider an extent the Lord assigns to those crimes we are sure: when He defines <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> <em>to consist</em> even in concupiscence, <span class="stiki" id="note030168"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse28">Matthew&nbsp;5:28</a></span> <q>if one shall have cast an eye lustfully on,</q> and stirred his <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> with immodest commotion; when He judges <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> <span class="stiki" id="note030169"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse22">Matthew&nbsp;5:22</a></span> <em>to consist</em> even in a word of curse or of reproach, and in every impulse of <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">anger</a>, and in the neglect of charity toward a brother just as John teaches, <span class="stiki" id="note030170"><a href="../bible/1jo003.htm#verse15">1&nbsp;John&nbsp;3:15</a></span> that he who <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> his brother is a murderer. Else, both the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> ingenuity in <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a>, and God the Lord's in the Discipline by which He fortifies us against the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> depths, <span class="stiki" id="note030171"><a href="../bible/rev002.htm#verse24">Revelation&nbsp;2:24</a></span> would have but limited scope, if we were judged only in such faults as even the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> nations have decreed punishable. How will our <q>righteousness abound above that of the <a href="../cathen/13634a.htm">Scribes</a> and <a href="../cathen/11789b.htm">Pharisees</a>,</q> as the Lord has prescribed, <span class="stiki" id="note030172"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;5:20</a></span> unless we shall have seen through the abundance of that adversary quality, that is, of <em>un</em>righteousness? But if the head of unrighteousness is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, the first point is, that we be fore-fortified against the abundance of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, while we recognise it not only in its palpable manifestations.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3. Idolatry: Origin and Meaning of the Name</h2>

<p>Idol in ancient times there was none. Before the artificers of this monstrosity had bubbled into being,  temples stood solitary and shrines empty, just as to the present day in some places traces of the ancient practice remain permanently. Yet <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> used to be practised, not under that name, but in that function; for even at this day it can be practised outside a temple, and without an idol. But when the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> introduced into the world artificers of <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a> and of images, and of every kind of likenesses, that former rude business of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> disaster attained from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> both a name and a development. Thenceforward every art which in any way produces an idol instantly became a fount of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For it makes no difference whether a moulder cast, or a carver grave, or an embroiderer weave <em>the idol</em>; because neither is it a question of material, whether an idol be formed of gypsum, or of colors, or of stone, or of bronze,  or of silver, or of thread. For since even without an idol <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is committed, when the idol is there it makes no difference of what kind it be, of what material, or what shape; lest any should think <em>that</em> only to be held an idol which is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> in <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> shape. To establish this point, the interpretation of the word is requisite. <em>Eidos</em>, in Greek, signifies <em>form</em>; <em>eidolon</em>, derived diminutively from that, by an equivalent process in our language, makes <em>formling</em>.  Every <em>form</em> or <em>formling</em>, therefore, claims to be called an <em>idol</em>. Hence <em><a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a></em> is <q>all attendance and service about every idol.</q> Hence also, every artificer of an idol is guilty of one and the same crime,  unless, the People  which <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for itself the likeness of a calf, and not of a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, fell short of incurring the guilt of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 4. Idols Not to Be Made, Much Less Worshipped. Idols and Idol-Makers in the Same Category</h2>

<p>God prohibits an idol as much to be <em>made</em> as to be <em>worshipped</em>. In so far as the <em>making</em> what may be worshipped is the prior act, so far is the prohibition to <em>make</em> (if the worship is unlawful) the prior prohibition. For this <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>&mdash; the eradicating, namely, of the material of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>&mdash; the divine law proclaims, <q>You shall make no idol;</q>  and by conjoining, <q>Nor a similitude of the things which are in the heaven, and which are in the earth, and which are in the sea,</q> has interdicted the servants of God from acts of that kind all the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a> over. <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> had preceded, predicting that <q>the <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and the spirits of the angelic <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostates</a>,  would turn into idolatry  all the elements, all the garniture of the <a href="../cathen/15183a.htm">universe</a>, all things contained in the heaven, in the sea, in the earth, that they might be <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> as <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> All things, therefore, does <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> worship, except the Founder of all Himself. The images of those things are <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; the consecration of the images is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Whatever guilt <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> incurs, must necessarily be imputed to every artificer of every idol. In short, the same <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a> fore-condemns in general menace both idol-worshippers and idol-makers together. And again: <q>I <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> to you, sinners, that against the day of perdition of blood  repentance is being prepared. You who serve stones, and you who make images of gold, and silver, and wood, and stones and clay, and serve phantoms, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, and spirits in fanes,  and all <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errors</a> not according to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, shall find no help from them.</q> But Isaiah  says, <q>You are witnesses whether there is a God except Me.</q> <q>And they who mould and carve out at that time were not: all vain! Who do that which likes them, which shall not profit them!</q> And that whole ensuing discourse sets a ban as well on the artificers as the worshippers: the close of which is, <q>Learn that their heart is ashes and earth, and that none can free his own <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>.</q> In which sentence David equally includes the makers too. <q>Such,</q> says he, <q>let them become who make them.</q>  And why should I, a man of limited memory, suggest anything further? Why recall anything more from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>? As if either the voice of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> were not sufficient; or else any further deliberation were needful, whether the Lord cursed and condemned by priority the <em>artificers</em> of those things, of which He curses and condemns the <em>worshippers!</em></p>

<h2>Chapter 5. &mdash; Sundry Objections or Excuses Dealt with</h2>

<p>We will certainly take more pains in answering the excuses of artificers of this kind, who ought never to be admitted into the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, if any have a <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of that Discipline.  To begin with, that speech, wont to be cast in our teeth, <q>I have nothing else whereby to live,</q> may be more severely retorted, <q>You have, then, whereby to live? If by your own <a href="../cathen/09053a.htm">laws</a>, what have you to do with God?</q>  Then, as to the argument they have the hardihood to bring even from the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scriptures</a>, <q>that the apostle has said, 'As each has been found, so let him persevere.'</q>  We may all, therefore, persevere in <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a></em>, as the result of <em>that</em> interpretation! For there is not any one of us who has not been found as a <em>sinner</em>, since no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> was the source of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> descent than that of setting <em>sinners</em> free. Again, they say the same apostle has left a precept, according to his own example, <q>That each one work with his own hands for a living.</q>  If this precept is maintained in respect to <em>all</em> hands, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a> even the bath-thieves  live by their hands, and <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbers</a> themselves gain the means to live by their hands; forgers, again, execute their <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> handwritings, not of course with their feet, but hands; actors, however, achieve a livelihood not with hands alone, but with their entire limbs. Let the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, therefore, stand open to <em>all</em> who are supported by their hands and by their own work; if there is no exception of arts which the Discipline of God receives not. But some one says, in opposition to our proposition of <q>similitude being interdicted,</q> <q>Why, then, did <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> in the <a href="../cathen/04749a.htm">desert</a> make a likeness of a serpent out of bronze?</q> The figures, which used to be laid as a groundwork for some secret future dispensation, not with a view to the repeal of the law, but as a type of their own final <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, stand in a class by themselves. Otherwise, if we should interpret these things as the adversaries of the law do, do we, too, as the Marcionites do, ascribe inconsistency to the Almighty, whom <em>they</em>  in this manner destroy as being mutable, while in one place He forbids, in another commands? But if any feigns <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of the fact that that effigy of the serpent of bronze, after the manner of one uphung, denoted the shape of the Lord's cross,  which was to free us from serpents&mdash; that is, from the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash; while, through itself, it hanged up the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> slain; or whatever other exposition of that figure has been revealed to worthier men  no matter, provided we remember the apostle affirms that all things happened at that time to the People  <em>figuratively</em>.  It is enough that the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, as by law He forbade the making of similitude, did, by the extraordinary precept in the case of the serpent, interdict similitude.  If you reverence the same <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you have His law, <q>You shall make no similitude.</q>  If you look back, too, to the precept enjoining the subsequently made similitude, do you, too, imitate <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>: make not any likeness in opposition to the law, unless to <em>you</em>, too, God have bidden it. </p>

<h2>Chapter 6. Idolatry Condemned by Baptism. To Make an Idol Is, in Fact, to Worship It</h2>

<p>If no law of God had prohibited <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> to be made by us; if no voice of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> uttered general menace no less against the makers than the worshippers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; from our sacrament itself we would draw our interpretation that arts of that kind are opposed to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For how have we <em>renounced</em> the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, if we <em>make</em> them? What <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> have we declared from them, I say not <em>with</em> whom, but <em>dependent on</em> whom, we live? What discord have we entered into with those to whom we are under obligation for the sake of our maintenance? Can you have denied with the tongue what with the hand you confess? unmake by word what by deed you make? Preach one <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you who make so many? Preach the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, you who make false ones? <q>I <em>make</em>,</q> says one, <q>but I <em>worship</em> not;</q> as if there were some <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> for which he dare not <em>worship</em>, besides that for which he ought not also to <em>make</em>&mdash;the offense done to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, namely, in either case. Nay, you who <em>make</em>, that they may be able to be worshipped, <em>do</em> worship; and you worship, not with the spirit of some worthless perfume, but with your own; nor at the expense of a beast's <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, but of your own. To them you immolate your ingenuity; to them you make your sweat a libation; to them you kindle the torch of your forethought. More are you to them than a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>, since it is by <em>your</em> means they <em>have</em> a <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a>; <em>your</em> diligence is <em>their</em> divinity.  Do you affirm that you <em>worship</em> not what you <em>make</em>? Ah! But <em>they</em> affirm not so, to whom you slay this fatter, more precious and greater victim, your <a href="../cathen/13407a.htm">salvation</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7. Grief of the Faithful at the Admission of Idol-Makers into the Church; Nay, Even into the Ministry</h2>

<p>A whole day the <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zeal</a> of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> will direct its pleadings to this quarter: bewailing that a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> should come from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; should come from an adversary workshop into the house of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; should raise to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> the Father hands which are the mothers of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; should <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> to God with the hands which, out of doors, are <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayed</a> to in opposition to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; should apply to the Lord's body those hands which confer bodies on <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. Nor is this sufficient. Grant that it be a small matter, if from other hands they receive what they contaminate; but even those very hands deliver to others what they have contaminated. Idol-artificers are chosen even into the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> order. Oh <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wickedness</a>! Once did the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> lay brands on Christ; these mangle His body daily. Oh hands to be cut off! Now let the saying, <q>If your hand make you do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, amputate it,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030200"><a href="../bible/mat018.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;18:8</a></span> see to it whether it were uttered by way of similitude <em>merely</em>. What hands more to be amputated than those in which scandal is done to the Lord's body?</p>

<h2>Chapter 8. Other Arts Made Subservient to Idolatry. Lawful Means of Gaining a Livelihood Abundant</h2>

<p>There are also other species of very many arts which, although they extend not to the <em>making</em> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, yet, with the same criminality, <em>furnish the adjuncts</em> without which <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> have no power. For it matters not whether you erect or equip: if you have embellished his temple, altar, or niche; if you have pressed out gold-leaf, or have wrought his insignia, or even his house: work of that kind, which confers not <em>shape</em>, but <em>authority</em>, is more important. If the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of maintenance   is urged so much, the arts have other species withal to afford means of livelihood, without outstepping the path of discipline, that is, without the confiction of an idol. The plasterer <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> both how to mend roofs, and lay on stuccoes, and polish a cistern, and trace ogives, and draw in relief on party-walls many other ornaments beside likenesses. The painter, too, the marble mason, the bronze-worker, and every graver whatever, <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> expansions  of his own art, of course much easier of execution. For how much more easily does he who delineates a <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statue</a> overlay a sideboard!  How much sooner does he who carves a Mars out of a lime-tree, fasten together a chest! No art but is either mother or kinswoman of some neighbour  art: nothing is independent of its neighbour. The veins of the arts are many as are the concupiscences of men. <q>But there is difference in wages and the rewards of handicraft;</q> therefore there is difference, too, in the labour required. Smaller wages are compensated by more frequent earning. How many are the party-walls which require <a href="../cathen/13641b.htm">statues</a>? How many the temples and shrines which are built for <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>? But houses, and official residences, and baths, and tenements, how many are they? Shoe- and slipper-gilding is daily work; not so the gilding of Mercury and Serapis. Let that suffice for the gain  of handicrafts. Luxury and ostentation have more votaries than all <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. Ostentation will require dishes and cups more easily than <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. Luxury deals in wreaths, also, more than ceremony. When, therefore, we urge men generally to such kinds of handicrafts as do not come in contact with an idol indeed and with the things which are appropriate to an idol; since, moreover, the things which are common to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> are often common to men too; of this also we ought to beware that nothing be, with our <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, demanded by any person from our <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols'</a> service. For if we shall have made that concession, and shall not have had recourse to the remedies so often used, I think we are not free of the contagion of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, we whose (not unwitting) hands  are found busied in the tendence, or in the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and service, of <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9. Professions of Some Kinds Allied to Idolatry. Of Astrology in Particular</h2>

<p>We observe among the arts  also some professions liable to the charge of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Of astrologers there should be no speaking even;  but since one in these days has challenged us, defending on his own behalf perseverance in that profession, I will use a few words. I allege not that he honours <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, whose names he has inscribed on the heaven,  to whom he has attributed all God's power; because men, presuming that we are disposed of by the immutable arbitrament of the stars, think on that account that God is not to be sought after. One proposition I lay down: that those <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>, the deserters from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the lovers of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>,  were likewise the discoverers of this curious art, on that account also condemned by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Oh divine sentence, reaching even unto the earth in its vigour, whereto the unwitting render testimony! The astrologers are expelled just like their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>. The city and <a href="../cathen/08208a.htm">Italy</a> are interdicted to the astrologers, just as heaven to their <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>.  There is the same penalty of exclusion for <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a> and masters. <q>But <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> and astrologers came from the east.</q>  We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> the mutual alliance of magic and <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a>. The interpreters of the stars, then, were the first to announce Christ's birth the first to present Him <q>gifts.</q> By this bond, [must] I <a href="../cathen/07672a.htm">imagine</a>, they put Christ under obligation to themselves? What then? Shall therefore the religion of those <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a> act as patron now also to astrologers? Astrology now-a-days, forsooth, treats of Christ&mdash; is the science of the stars of Christ; not of Saturn, or Mars, and whomsoever else out of the same class of the dead  it pays observance to and preaches? But, however, that science has been allowed until the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, in order that after Christ's birth no one should thence forward interpret any one's nativity by the heaven. For they therefore offered to the then infant Lord that frankincense and myrrh and gold, to be, as it were, the close of worldly  <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> and <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>, which Christ was about to do away. What, then? The dream&mdash; sent, doubtless, of the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>&mdash; suggested to the same <a href="../cathen/09527a.htm">Magi</a>, namely, that they should go home, but by another way, not that by which they came. It means this: that they should not walk in their ancient path.  Not that <a href="../cathen/07289c.htm">Herod</a> should not pursue them, who in fact did not pursue them; unwitting even that they had departed <em>by another way</em>, since he was withal unwitting by what way they <em>came</em>. Just so we ought to understand by it the right Way and Discipline. And so the precept was rather, that thence forward they should <em>walk otherwise</em>. So, too, that other species of magic which operates by <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a>, emulous even in opposition to <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a>,  tried God's patience until the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>. For thenceforward <a href="../cathen/13797b.htm">Simon Magus</a>, just turned believer, (since he was still thinking somewhat of his juggling <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>; to wit, that among the <a href="../cathen/10338a.htm">miracles</a> of his profession he might buy even the gift of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> through imposition of hands) was cursed by the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>, and ejected from the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.  Both he and that other magician, who was with Sergius Paulus, (since he began opposing himself to the same <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>) was mulcted with loss of eyes.  The same <a href="../cathen/05793a.htm">fate</a>, I <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, would astrologers, too, have met, if any had fallen in the way of the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a>. But yet, when magic is punished, of which <a href="../cathen/02018e.htm">astrology</a> is a species, of course the species is condemned in the genus. After the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a>, you will nowhere find either sophists, Chaldeans, enchanters, <a href="../cathen/05048b.htm">diviners</a>, or magicians, except as clearly punished. <q>Where is the wise, where the grammarian, where the disputer of this age? Hath not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> made foolish the wisdom of this age?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030219"><a href="../bible/1co001.htm#verse20">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;1:20</a></span> You <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> nothing, astrologer, if you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not that you should be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>. If you did <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it, you ought to have <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> this also, that you should have nothing more to do with that profession of yours which, of itself, fore-chants the climacterics of others, and might instruct you of its own danger. There is no part nor lot for you in that system of yours.  He cannot hope for the kingdom of the heavens, whose finger or wand abuses  the heaven.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10. Of Schoolmasters and Their Difficulties</h2>

<p>Moreover, we must inquire likewise touching schoolmasters; nor only of them, but also all other professors of literature. Nay, on the contrary, we must not <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that they are in affinity with manifold <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>: <em>first</em>, in that it is necessary for them to preach the gods of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, to express their names, genealogies, <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> distinctions, all and singular; and <em>further</em>, to observe the solemnities and festivals of the same, as of them by whose means they compute their revenues. What schoolmaster, without a table of the seven <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>,  will yet frequent the Quinquatria? The very first payment of every pupil he consecrates both to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> and to the name of Minerva; so that, even though he be not said <q>to eat of that which is <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificed</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a></q>  <em>nominally</em> (not being dedicated to any particular idol), he is shunned as an idolater. What less of defilement does he recur on that ground,  than a business brings which, both nominally and virtually, is <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> publicly to an idol? The Minervalia are as much Minerva's, as the Saturnalia Saturn's; Saturn's, which must necessarily be celebrated even by little slaves at the time of the Saturnalia. New-year's gifts likewise must be caught at, and the Septimontium kept; and all the presents of Midwinter and the feast of Dear Kinsmanship must be exacted; the schools must be wreathed with flowers; the flamens' wives and the &aelig;diles <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>; the school is honoured on the appointed holy-days. The same thing takes place on an idol's birthday; every pomp of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is frequented. Who will think that these things are befitting to a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> master,  unless <em>it be he</em> who shall think them suitable likewise to one who is not a master? We <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> it may be said, <q>If teaching literature is not lawful to God's servants, neither will learning be likewise;</q> and, <q>How could one be trained unto ordinary <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> intelligence, or unto any sense or action whatever, since literature is the means of training for all life? How do we repudiate secular studies, without which divine studies cannot be pursued?</q> Let us see, then, the <a href="../cathen/10733a.htm">necessity</a> of literary erudition; let us reflect that partly it cannot be admitted, partly cannot be avoided. Learning literature is allowable for <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, rather than teaching; for the principle of learning and of teaching is different. If a believer teach literature, while he is teaching doubtless he commends, while he delivers he affirms, while he recalls he bears testimony to, the praises of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> interspersed therein. He seals the gods themselves with this name;  whereas the Law, as we have said, prohibits <q>the names of gods to be pronounced,</q>  and this name  to be conferred on vanity.  Hence the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> gets men's early <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> built up from the beginnings of their erudition. Inquire whether he who catechizes about <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> commit <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. But when a believer <em>learns</em> these things, if he is already capable of understanding what <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is, he neither receives nor allows them; much more if he is not yet capable. Or, when he <em>begins</em> to understand, it behooves him first to understand what he has previously learned, that is, touching God and the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. Therefore he will reject those things, and will not receive them; and will be as safe as one who from one who <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> it not, knowingly <em>accepts</em> poison, but does not <em>drink</em> it. To <em>him</em> necessity is attributed as an excuse, because he has no other way to learn. Moreover, the not <em>teaching</em> literature is as much easier than the not <em>learning</em>, as it is easier, too, for the pupil not to attend, than for the master not to frequent, the rest of the defilements incident to the schools from public and scholastic solemnities.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11. Connection Between Covetousness and Idolatry. Certain Trades, However Gainful, to Be Avoided</h2>

<p>If we think over the rest of faults, tracing them from their generations, let us begin with <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a>, <q>a root of all <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030230"><a href="../bible/1ti006.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;6:10</a></span> wherewith, indeed, some having been ensnared, <q>have suffered shipwreck about <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030231"><a href="../bible/1ti001.htm#verse19">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;1:19</a></span> Albeit <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> is by the same apostle called <em><a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a></em>.  In the next place <em>proceeding to</em> mendacity, the minister of <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> (of false swearing I am silent, since even swearing is not lawful )&mdash; is <em>trade</em> adapted for a servant of God? But, <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> apart, what is the motive for acquiring? When the motive for acquiring ceases, there will be no necessity for trading. Grant now that there be some righteousness in business, secure from the duty of watchfulness against <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covetousness</a> and mendacity; I take it that that trade which pertains to the very <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and spirit of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, which pampers every <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>, falls under the charge of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Rather, is not that the <em>principal</em> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>? If the selfsame merchandises&mdash; frankincense, I mean, and all other foreign productions&mdash; used as <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, are of use likewise to men for medicinal ointments, to us <em><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a></em> also, over and above, for solaces of sepulture, let them see to it. At all events, while the pomps, while the priesthoods, while the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, are furnished by dangers, by losses, by inconveniences, by cogitations, by runnings to and fro, or trades, what else are you demonstrated to be but an <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols'</a> agent? Let none contend that, in this way, exception may be taken to <em>all</em> trades. All graver faults extend the sphere for diligence in watchfulness proportionably to the magnitude of the danger; in order that we may withdraw not only from the faults, but from the means through which they have being. For although the fault be done by others, it makes no difference if it be <em>by my means</em>. In no case ought I to be <em>necessary</em> to another, while he is doing what to me is unlawful. Hence I ought to understand that care must be taken by me, lest what I am forbidden to do be done <em>by my means</em>. In short, in another <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of no lighter guilt I observe that fore-judgment. In that I am interdicted from fornication, I furnish nothing of help or connivance to others for that purpose; in that I have separated my own flesh itself from stews, I acknowledge that I cannot exercise the trade of pandering, or keep that kind of places for my neighbour's behoof. So, too, the interdiction of <a href="../cathen/07441a.htm">murder</a> shows me that a trainer of gladiators also is excluded from the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; nor will any one fail to be the means of doing what he subministers to another to do. Behold, here is a more kindred fore-judgment: if a purveyor of the public victims come over to the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, will you permit him to remain permanently in that trade? Or if one who is already a believer shall have undertaken that business, will you think that he is to be retained in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>? No, I take it; unless any one will dissemble in the case of a frankincense-seller too. In truth, the agency of <em>blood</em> pertains to some, that of <em>odours</em> to others. If, before <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> were in the world, <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, hitherto shapeless, used to be transacted by these wares; if, even now, the work of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is perpetrated, for the most part, without the idol, by burnings of odours; the frankincense-seller is a something even more serviceable even toward <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, for <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is more easily carried on without the idol, than without the ware of the frankincense-seller.  Let us interrogate thoroughly the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> itself. With what mouth will a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> frankincense-seller, if he shall pass through temples, with what mouth will he spit down upon and blow out the smoking altars, for which himself has made provision? With what consistency will he <a href="../cathen/05709a.htm">exorcise</a> his own foster-children,  to whom he affords his own house as store-room? Indeed, if he shall have ejected a <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demon</a>,  let <em>him</em> not congratulate himself on his <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, for he has not ejected an <em>enemy</em>; he ought to have had his <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a> easily granted by one whom he is daily feeding.  No art, then, no profession, no trade, which administers either to equipping or forming <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, can be free from the title of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; unless we interpret <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> to be altogether something else than the service of idol-tendence.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12. Further Answers to the Plea, How Am I to Live?</h2>

<p>In vain do we flatter ourselves as to the necessities of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> maintenance, if&mdash; after <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> sealed &mdash; we say, <q>I have no means to live?</q>  For here I will now answer more fully that abrupt proposition. It is advanced <em>too late</em>. For after the similitude of that most <a href="../cathen/12517b.htm">prudent</a> builder,  who first computes the costs of the work, together with his own means, lest, when he has begun, he afterwards blush to find himself spent, deliberation should have been made <em>before</em>. But even now you have the Lord's sayings, as examples taking away from you all excuse. For what is it you say? <q>I shall be in need.</q> But the Lord calls the needy <q><a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happy</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030241"><a href="../bible/luk006.htm#verse20">Luke&nbsp;6:20</a></span> <q>I shall have no food.</q> But <q>think not,</q> says He, <q>about food;</q>  and as an example of clothing we have the lilies.  <q>My work was my subsistence.</q> Nay, but <q>all things are to be sold, and divided to the <a href="../cathen/12327a.htm">needy</a>.</q>  <q>But provision must be made for children and posterity.</q> <q>None, putting his hand on the plough, and looking back, is fit</q> for work.  <q>But I was under contract.</q> <q>None can serve two lords.</q>  If you wish to be the Lord's <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciple</a>, it is necessary you <q>take your cross, and follow the Lord:</q>  <em>your cross</em>; that is, your own <em>straits</em> and <em>tortures</em>, or your <em>body</em> only, which is after the manner of a <em>cross</em>. Parents, wives, children, will have to be left behind, for God's sake.  Do you hesitate about arts, and trades, and about professions likewise, for the sake of children and <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>? Even there was it demonstrated to us, that both <q>dear pledges,</q>  and handicrafts, and trades, are to be quite left behind for the Lord's sake; while James and John, called by the Lord, do leave quite behind both father and ship;  while Matthew is roused up from the toll-booth;  while even burying a father was too tardy a business for <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. <span class="stiki" id="note030252"><a href="../bible/luk009.htm#verse59">Luke&nbsp;9:59-60</a></span> None of them whom the Lord chose to Him said, <q>I have no means to live.</q> Faith fears not famine. It <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a>, likewise, that hunger is no less to be contemned by it for God's sake, than every kind of death. It has learned not to respect <em>life</em>; how much more <em>food</em>? [You ask] <q>How many have fulfilled these conditions?</q> But what with men is difficult, with God is easy.  Let us, however, comfort ourselves about the gentleness and clemency of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> in such wise, as not to indulge our <q>necessities</q> up to the point of affinities with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, but to avoid even from afar every breath of it, as of a pestilence. [And this] not merely in the cases forementioned, but in the universal series of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>; whether appropriated to its gods, or to the defunct, or to kings, as pertaining to the selfsame unclean spirits, sometimes through <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and priesthoods, sometimes through spectacles and the like, sometimes through holy-days.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13. Of the Observance of Days Connected with Idolatry</h2>

<p>But why speak of <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> and priesthoods? Of spectacles, moreover, and pleasures of that kind, we have already filled a volume of their own.  In this place must be handled the subject of holidays and other extraordinary solemnities, which we accord sometimes to our wantonness, sometimes to our timidity, in opposition to the common <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and Discipline. The first point, indeed, on which I shall join issue is this: whether a servant of God ought to share with the very nations themselves in matters of his kind either in dress, or in food, or in any other kind of their <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">gladness</a>. <q>To <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with the rejoicing, and grieve with the grieving,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030255"><a href="../bible/rom012.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;12:15</a></span> is said about <em>brethren</em> by the apostle when exhorting to unanimity. But, for <em>these</em> purposes, <q>There is nought of communion between light and darkness,</q>  between life and death or else we rescind what is written, <q>The world shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, but you shall grieve.</q>  If we <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> with the world, there is reason to <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that with the world we shall grieve too. But when the world rejoices, let us grieve; and when the world afterward grieves, we shall <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>. Thus, too, Eleazar  in Hades,  (attaining refreshment in <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham's</a> bosom) and the rich man, (on the other hand, set in the torment of fire) compensate, by an answerable retribution, their alternate vicissitudes of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and good. There are certain gift-days, which with some adjust the claim of <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, with others the debt of wages. <q>Now, then,</q> you say, <q>I shall receive back what is mine, or pay back what is another's.</q> If men have <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> for themselves this custom from <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, why do you, estranged as you are from all their vanity, participate in solemnities <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>; as if for you also there were some prescript about a day, short of the observance of a particular day, to prevent your paying or receiving what you owe a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, or what is owed you by a man? Give me the form after which you wish to be dealt with. For why should you skulk withal, when you contaminate your own <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a> by your neighbour's <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a>? If you are not unknown to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>, you are tempted, and you act as if you were not a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> against your neighbour's <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>; if, however, you shall be disguised withal,  you are the slave of the <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a>. At all events, whether in the latter or the former way, you are guilty of being <q>ashamed of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q>  But <q>whosoever shall be ashamed of Me in the presence of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, of him will I too be ashamed,</q> says He, <q>in the presence of my Father who is in the heavens.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 14. Of Blasphemy. One of St. Paul's Sayings</h2>

<p>But, however, the majority (of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>) have by this time induced the belief in their mind that it is pardonable if at any time they do what the <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> do, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> <q>the Name be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>.</q> Now the <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> which must quite be shunned by us in every way is, I take it, this: If any of us lead a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> into <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> with good <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a>, either by fraud, or by injury, or by contumely, or any other matter of worthy complaint, in which <q>the Name</q> is deservedly impugned, so that the Lord, too, be deservedly <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a>. Else, if of <em>all</em> <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a> it has been said, <q>By your means My Name is <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>,</q>  we all perish at once; since the whole circus, with no desert of ours, assails <q>the Name</q> with <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> suffrages. Let us cease (to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>) and it will not be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>! On the contrary, while we are, let it be <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemed</a>: in the observance, not the overstepping, of discipline; while we are being approved, not while we are being reprobated. Oh <a href="../cathen/02595a.htm">blasphemy</a>, bordering on <a href="../cathen/09736b.htm">martyrdom</a>, which now <em>at</em>tests me to be a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a>,  while for that very account it <em>de</em>tests me! The cursing of well-maintained Discipline is a blessing of the Name. <q>If,</q> says he, <q>I wished to please men, I should not be Christ's servant.</q>  But the same apostle elsewhere bids us take care to please all: <q>As I,</q> he says, <q>please all by all means.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030266"><a href="../bible/1co010.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;10:32-33</a></span> No <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> he used to please them by celebrating the Saturnalia and New-year's day! [Was it so] or was it by moderation and patience? By gravity, by kindness, by integrity? In like manner, when he is saying, <q>I have become all things to all, that I may gain all,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030267"><a href="../bible/1co009.htm#verse22">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;9:22</a></span> does he mean <q>to idolaters an idolater?</q> <q>to <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>?</q> <q>to the worldly worldly?</q> But albeit he does not prohibit us from having our conversation with idolaters and adulterers, and the other criminals, saying, <q>Otherwise you would go out from the world,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030268"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> of course he does not so slacken those reins of conversation that, since it is necessary for us both to <em>live</em> and to <em>mingle</em> with sinners, we may be able to <em><a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a></em> with them too. Where there is the intercourse of life, which the apostle concedes, there is sinning, which no one permits. To live with <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> is lawful, to die with them  is not. Let us live with all;  let us be glad with them, out of community of nature, not of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. We are peers in <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, not in discipline; fellow-possessors of the world, not of <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a>. But if we have no right of communion in matters of this kind with strangers, how far more <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> to celebrate them among brethren! Who can maintain or defend this? The <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> upbraids the <a href="../cathen/08399a.htm">Jews</a> with their holy-days. <q>Your <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a>, and new moons, and ceremonies,</q> says He, <q>My <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a>.</q>  By us, to whom <a href="../cathen/13287b.htm">Sabbaths</a> are strange,  and the new moons and festivals formerly beloved by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the Saturnalia and New-year's and Midwinter's festivals and Matronalia are frequented&mdash; presents come and go&mdash; New-year's gifts&mdash; games join their noise&mdash; banquets join their din! Oh better fidelity of the nations to their own <a href="../cathen/13674a.htm">sect</a>, which claims no <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a> of the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a> for itself! Not the Lord's day, not Pentecost, even it they had <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">known</a> them, would they have shared with us; for they would <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> lest they should seem to be <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. <em>We</em> are not apprehensive lest we seem to be <em><a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a></em>! If any indulgence is to be granted to the flesh, you have it. I will not say your own days,  but more too; for to the <em><a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a></em> each festive day occurs but once annually: <em>you</em> have a festive day every eighth day.  Call out the individual solemnities of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, and set them out into a row, they will not be able to make up a Pentecost. </p>

<h2>Chapter 15. Concerning Festivals in Honour of Emperors, Victories, and the Like. Examples of the Three Children and Daniel</h2>

<p>But <q>let your works shine,</q> says He; <span class="stiki" id="note030276"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;5:16</a></span> but now all our shops and gates shine! You will now-a-days find more doors of <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> without lamps and laurel-wreaths than of <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>. What does the case seem to be with regard to that species (of ceremony) also? If it is an idol's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, without <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> an idol's <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. If it is for a man's sake, let us again consider that all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is for man's sake;  let us again consider that all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is a worship done to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, since it is generally agreed even among their worshippers that aforetime the gods themselves of the nations were men; and so it makes no difference whether that superstitious homage be rendered to men of a former age or of this. Idolatry is condemned, not on account of the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> which are set up for worship, but on account of those its observances, which pertain to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. <q>The things which are C&aelig;sar's are to be rendered to C&aelig;sar.</q>  It is enough that He set in apposition thereto, <q>and to God the things which are God's.</q> What things, then, are C&aelig;sar's? Those, to wit, about which the consultation was then held, whether the poll-tax should be furnished to C&aelig;sar or no. Therefore, too, the Lord demanded that the money should be shown Him, and inquired about the image, whose it was; and when He had heard it was C&aelig;sar's, said, <q>Render to C&aelig;sar what are C&aelig;sar's, and what are God's to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>;</q> that is, the image of C&aelig;sar, which is on the coin, to C&aelig;sar, and the image of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, which is on man,  to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; so as to render to C&aelig;sar indeed money, to God yourself. Otherwise, what will be God's, if all things are C&aelig;sar's? <q>Then,</q> do you say, <q>the lamps before my doors, and the laurels on my posts are an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to God?</q> <em>They are there</em> of course, not because they are an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but to him who is <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> in God's stead by ceremonial observances of that kind, so far as is manifest, saving the religious performance, which is in secret appertaining to <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>. For we ought to be sure if there are any whose notice it escapes through <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> of this world's literature, that there are among the Romans even gods of entrances; Cardea (Hinge-goddess), called after hinges, and Forculus (Door-god) after doors, and Limentinus (Threshold-god) after the threshold, and Janus himself (Gate-god) after the gate: and of course we <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that, though names be empty and feigned, yet, when they are drawn down into <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> and every unclean spirit seize them for themselves, through the bond of consecration. Otherwise <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> have no name individually, but they there find a name where they find also a token. Among the Greeks likewise we read of Apollo Thyr&aelig;us, <em>i.e.</em> of the door, and the Antelii, or Anthelii, <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>, as presiders over entrances. These things, therefore, the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> foreseeing from the beginning, fore-chanted, through the most ancient <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> <a href="../cathen/07218a.htm">Enoch</a>, that even entrances would come into superstitious use. For we see too that other entrances  are adored in the baths. But if there are beings which are adored in <em>entrances</em>, it is to them that both the lamps and the laurels will pertain. To an idol you will have done whatever you shall have done to an <em>entrance</em>. In this place I call a <a href="../cathen/15677a.htm">witness</a> on the authority also of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; because it is not safe to suppress whatever may have been shown to <em>one</em>, of course for the sake of <em>all</em>. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that a brother was severely chastised, the same night, through a vision, because on the sudden announcement of public rejoicings his servants had wreathed his gates. And yet himself had not wreathed, or commanded them to be wreathed; for he had gone forth <em>from home</em> before, and on his return had reprehended the deed. So strictly are we appraised with God in matters of this kind, even with regard to the discipline of our <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">family</a>.  Therefore, as to what relates to the honours due to kings or emperors, we have a prescript sufficient, that it behooves us to be in all <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a>, according to the apostle's precept,  <q>subject to magistrates, and princes, and powers;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030283"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse1">Titus&nbsp;3:1</a></span> but within the limits of discipline, so long as we keep ourselves separate from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. For it is for this reason, too, that that example of the three brethren has forerun us, who, in other respects <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedient</a> toward king Nebuchodonosor rejected with all constancy the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to his image, <span class="stiki" id="note030284"><a href="../bible/dan002.htm">Daniel 2-3</a></span> proving that whatever is extolled beyond the measure of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, unto the resemblance of divine sublimity, is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. So too, Daniel, in all other points submissive to Darius, remained in his duty so long as it was free from danger to his religion; <span class="stiki" id="note030285"><a href="../bible/dan006.htm">Daniel&nbsp;vi</a></span> for, to avoid undergoing <em>that</em> danger, <em>he</em> feared the royal lions no more than <em>they</em> the royal fires. Let, therefore, them who have no light, light their lamps daily; let them over whom the fires of <a href="../cathen/07207a.htm">hell</a> are imminent, affix to their posts, laurels doomed presently to burn: to them the testimonies of darkness and the omens of their penalties are suitable. <em>You</em> are a light of the world,  and a tree ever green.  If you have renounced temples, make not your own gate a temple. I have said too little. If you have renounced stews, clothe not your own house with the appearance of a new brothel.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16. Concerning Private Festivals</h2>

<p>Touching the ceremonies, however, of private and social solemnities&mdash; as those of the white toga, of espousals, of nuptials, of name-givings&mdash; I should think no danger need be guarded against from the breath of the <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> which is mixed up with them. For the causes are to be considered to which the ceremony is due. Those above-named I take to be clean in themselves, because neither manly garb, nor the marital ring or union, descends from honours done to any idol. In short, I find no dress cursed by <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> dress on a man:  for <q>cursed,</q> says He, <q>is every man who clothes himself in <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman's</a> attire.</q> The toga, however, is a dress of manly <em>name</em> as well as <em>of manly use</em>.  God no more prohibits nuptials to be celebrated than a name to be given. <q>But there are <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> appropriated to these occasions.</q> Let me be invited, and let not the title of the ceremony be <q>assistance at a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>,</q> and the discharge of my good offices is at the service <em>of my friends</em>. Would that it were <q>at <em>their</em> service</q> indeed, and that we could escape <em>seeing</em> what is unlawful for us to <em>do</em>. But since the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> one has so surrounded the world with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, it will be lawful for us to be present at some ceremonies which see us doing service to a <em>man</em>, not to an <em>idol</em>. Clearly, if invited unto <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> function and <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>, I will not go, for that is service peculiar to an idol; but neither will I furnish advice, or expense, or any other good office in a matter of <em>that</em> kind. If it is on account of the <em><a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a></em> that I be invited, and stand by, I shall be partaker of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; if any <em>other</em> <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> conjoins me to the sacrificer, I shall be merely a spectator of the <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a>. </p>

<h2>Chapter 17. The Cases of Servants and Other Officials. What Offices a Christian Man May Hold</h2>

<p>But what shall believing servants or children  do? Officials likewise, when attending on their lords, or patrons, or superiors, when <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a>? Well, if any one shall have handed the wine to a sacrificer, nay, if by any single word necessary or belonging to a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> he shall have aided him, he will be held to be a minister of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Mindful of this rule, we can render service even <q>to magistrates and powers,</q> after the example of the patriarchs and the other forefathers,  who <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatrous</a> kings up to the confine of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Hence arose, very lately, a dispute whether a servant of God should take the administration of any dignity or power, if he be able, whether by some special <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, or by adroitness, to keep himself intact from every species of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>; after the example that both Joseph and Daniel, clean from <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, administered both dignity and power in the livery and purple of the prefecture of entire <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> or Babylonia. And so let us grant that it is possible for any one to succeed in moving, in whatsoever office, under the mere <em>name</em> of the office, neither <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrificing</a> nor lending his authority to <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a>; not farming out victims; not assigning to others the care of temples; not looking after their tributes; not giving spectacles at his own or the public charge, or presiding over the giving them; making proclamation or edict for no <a href="../cathen/14133a.htm">solemnity</a>; not even taking oaths: moreover (what comes under the head of <em>power</em>), neither sitting in judgment on any one's life or character, for you might bear with his judging about <em>money</em>; neither condemning nor fore-condemning;  binding no one, imprisoning or torturing no one&mdash; if it is credible that all this is possible.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18. Dress as Connected with Idolatry</h2>

<p>But we must now treat of the garb only and apparatus of office. There is a dress proper to every one, as well for daily use as for office and dignity. That famous purple, therefore, and the gold as an ornament of the neck, were, among the Egyptians and <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylonians</a>, ensigns of dignity, in the same way as bordered, or striped, or palm-embroidered togas, and the golden wreaths of provincial <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priests</a>, are now; but not on the same terms. For they used only to be conferred, under the name of <em><a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a></em>, on such as deserved the familiar friendship of kings (whence, too, such used to be styled the <q>purpled-men</q>  of kings, just as among us,  some, from their white toga, are called <q>candidates</q> ); but <em>not</em> on the understanding that that garb should be tied to <em>priesthoods</em> also, or <em>to any idol-ceremonies</em>. For if <em>that</em> were the case, of course men of such <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and constancy  would instantly have refused the defiled dresses; and it would instantly have appeared that Daniel had been no <a href="../cathen/15753a.htm">zealous</a> slave to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, nor worshipped Bel, nor the dragon, which long after <em>did</em> appear. That purple, therefore, was simple, and used not at that time to be a mark of <em>dignity</em>  among the barbarians, but of <em>nobility</em>.  For as both Joseph, who had been a slave, and Daniel, who through  captivity had changed his state, attained the freedom of the states of <a href="../cathen/02179b.htm">Babylon</a> and <a href="../cathen/05329b.htm">Egypt</a> through the dress of barbaric nobility;  so among us <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> also, if need so be, the bordered toga will be proper to be conceded to boys, and the stole to girls,  as ensigns of birth, not of power; of race, not of office; of rank, not of <a href="../cathen/14339a.htm">superstition</a>. But the purple, or the other ensigns of dignities and powers, dedicated from the beginning to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> engrafted on the dignity and the powers, carry the spot of their own profanation; since, moreover, bordered and striped togas, and broad-barred ones, are put even on <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> themselves; and <em>fasces</em> also, and rods, are borne before them; and deservedly, for <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> are the magistrates of this world: they bear the <em>fasces</em> and the purples, the ensigns of one college. What end, then, will you advance if you use the garb indeed, but administer not the functions of it? In things unclean, none can appear clean. If you put on a tunic defiled in itself, it perhaps may not be defiled through you; but you, through it, will be unable to be clean. Now by this time, you who argue about <q>Joseph</q> and <q>Daniel,</q> <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that things old and new, rude and polished, begun and developed, slavish and free, are not always comparable. For they, even by their circumstances, were slaves; but you, the slave of none,  in so far as you are the slave of Christ alone,  who has freed you likewise from the captivity of the world, will incur the duty of acting after your Lord's pattern. That Lord walked in humility and obscurity, with no definite home: for <q>the <a href="../cathen/14144a.htm">Son of man</a>,</q> said He, <q>has not where to lay His head;</q>  unadorned in dress, for else He had not said, <q>Behold, they who are clad in soft raiment are in kings' houses:</q>  in short, inglorious in countenance and aspect, just as Isaiah withal had fore-announced. <span class="stiki" id="note030307"><a href="../bible/isa053.htm#verse2">Isaiah&nbsp;53:2</a></span> If, also, He exercised no right of power even over His own followers, to whom He discharged menial ministry;  if, in short, though conscious of His own kingdom,  He shrank back from being made a king, <span class="stiki" id="note030310"><a href="../bible/joh006.htm#verse15">John&nbsp;6:15</a></span> He in the fullest manner gave His own an example for turning coldly from all the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> and garb, as well of dignity as of power. For <em>if they were to be used</em>, who would rather have used them than the <a href="../cathen/14142b.htm">Son of God</a>? What kind and what number of <em>fasces</em> would escort Him? What kind of purple would bloom from His shoulders? What kind of gold would beam from His head, had He not judged the <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a> of the world to be alien both to Himself and to His? Therefore what He was unwilling to accept, He has rejected; what He rejected, He has condemned; what He condemned, He has counted as part of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> pomp. For He would not have condemned things, except such as were not His; but things which are not God's, can be no other's but the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a>. If you have forsworn <q>the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> pomp,</q>  <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that whatever there you touch is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. Let even this fact help to remind you that all the powers and dignities of this world are not only alien to, but enemies of, <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; that through them punishments have been determined against God's servants; through them, too, penalties prepared for the impious are ignored. But <q>both your birth and your substance are troublesome to you in resisting <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>.</q>  For avoiding it, remedies cannot be lacking; since, even if they be lacking, there remains that one by which you will be made a happier magistrate, not in the earth, but in the heavens. </p>

<h2>Chapter 19. Concerning Military Service</h2>

<p>In that last section, decision may seem to have been given likewise concerning military service, which is between dignity and power.  But now inquiry is made about this point, whether a believer may turn himself unto military service, and whether the military may be admitted unto the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, even the rank and file, or each inferior grade, to whom there is no necessity for taking part in <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifices</a> or capital punishments. There is no agreement between the divine and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> sacrament,  the standard of Christ and the standard of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, the camp of light and the camp of darkness. One <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> cannot be due to two <em>masters</em>&mdash; God and C&aelig;sar. And yet <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> carried a rod,  and <a href="../cathen/01003a.htm">Aaron</a> wore a buckle,  and John (Baptist) is girt with leather  and Joshua the son of Nun leads a line of march; and the People warred: if it pleases you to sport with the subject. But how will <em>a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> man</em> <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">war</a>, nay, how will he serve even in peace, without a sword, which the Lord has taken away?  For albeit soldiers had come unto John, and had received the formula of their rule;  albeit, likewise, a centurion had <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a>;  <em>still</em> the Lord afterward, in disarming Peter, unbe**d every soldier. No dress is lawful among us, if assigned to any unlawful action.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20. Concerning Idolatry in Words</h2>

<p>But, however, since the conduct according to the divine rule is imperilled, not merely by <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, but likewise by words, (for, just as it is written, <q>Behold the man and his <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>;</q>  so, <q>Out of your own mouth shall you be justified</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030323"><a href="../bible/mat012.htm#verse37">Matthew&nbsp;12:37</a></span>), we ought to remember that, even in <em>words</em>, also the inroad of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> must be foreguarded against, either from the defect of custom or of timidity. The law prohibits the gods of the nations from being named,  not of course that we are not to pronounce their names, the speaking of which common intercourse extorts from us: for this must very frequently be said, <q>You find him in the temple of &AElig;sculapius;</q> and, <q>I live in Isis Street;</q> and, <q>He has been made <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priest</a> of Jupiter;</q> and much else after this manner, since even on <em>men</em> names of this kind are bestowed. I do not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> Saturnus if I call a man so, by his own name. I <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> him no more than I do Marcus, if I call a man Marcus. But it says, <q>Make not mention of the name of other gods, neither be it heard from your mouth.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030325"><a href="../bible/exo023.htm#verse13">Exodus&nbsp;23:13</a></span> The precept it gives is this, that we do not call them <em>gods</em>. For in the first part of the law, too, <q>You shall not,</q> says He, <q>use the name of the Lord your God in a vain thing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030326"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;20:7</a></span> that is, in an idol.  Whoever, therefore, honours an idol with the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, has fallen into <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. But if I speak of them as gods, something must be added to make it appear that <em>I</em> do not call them gods. For even the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> names <q>gods,</q> but adds <q>their,</q> viz. <q>of the nations:</q> just as David does when he had named <q>gods,</q> where he says, <q>But the gods of the nations are <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a>.</q>  But this has been laid by me rather as a foundation for ensuing observations. However, it is a defect of custom to say, <q>By Hercules, So help me the god of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>;</q>  while to the <em>custom</em> is added the <em><a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a></em> of some, who are <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> that it is an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> by Hercules. Further, what will an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a> be, in the name of gods whom you have forsworn, but a collusion of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> with <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>? For who does not <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> them in whose name he swears?</p>

<h2>Chapter 21. Of Silent Acquiescence in Heathen Formularies</h2>

<p>But it is a mark of timidity, when some other man binds you in the name of his gods, by the making of an <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, or by some other form of attestation, and you, for <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of discovery,  remain quiet. For you equally, by remaining quiet, affirm their majesty, by reason of which <em>majesty</em> you will seem to be bound. What matters it, whether you affirm the gods of the nations by calling them gods, or by hearing them so called? Whether you <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a> by <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, or, when adjured by another, acquiesce? Why should we not recognize the subtleties of <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a>, who makes it his aim that, what he cannot effect by <em>our</em> mouth, he may effect by the mouth of his servants, introducing <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> into us through our ears? At all events, whoever the adjurer is, he binds you to himself either in friendly or unfriendly conjunction. If in unfriendly, you are now challenged unto battle, and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that you must fight. If in friendly, with how far greater security will you transfer your engagement unto the Lord, that you may dissolve the obligation of him through whose means the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Evil One</a> was seeking to annex you to the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, that is, to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>! All sufferance of that kind is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. You <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> those to whom, when imposed as authorities, you have rendered respect. I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that one (whom the Lord pardon!), when it had been said to him in public during a law-suit, <q>Jupiter be <a href="../cathen/01489a.htm">angry</a> with you,</q> answered, <q>On the contrary, with <em>you</em>.</q> What else would a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a> have done who <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believed</a> Jupiter to be a god? For even had he not retorted the malediction by Jupiter (or other such like), yet, <em>by merely</em> returning a curse, he would have confirmed the divinity of Jove, showing himself irritated by a malediction in Jove's name. For what is there to be indignant at, (if cursed) in the name of one whom you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> to be nothing? For if you rave, you immediately affirm his <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, and the profession of your <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> will be an act of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. How much more, while you are returning the malediction in the name of Jupiter himself, are you doing <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to Jupiter in the same way as he who provoked you! But a believer ought to laugh in such cases, not to rave; nay, according to the precept,  not to return a curse in the name of God even, but dearly to <em>bless</em> in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, that you may both demolish <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a> and preach <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and fulfil discipline.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22. Of Accepting Blessing in the Name of Idols</h2>

<p>Equally, one who has been initiated into Christ will not endure to be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the name of the gods of the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">nations</a>, so as not always to reject the unclean benediction, and to cleanse it out for himself by converting it Godward. To be <a href="../cathen/02599b.htm">blessed</a> in the name of the gods of the nations is to be cursed in the name of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. If I have given an <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, or shown any other kindness, and the recipient <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">pray</a> that his gods, or the Genius of the colony, may be propitious to me, my oblation or act will immediately be an <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>, in whose name he returns me the favour of blessing. But why should he not <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that I have done it for God's sake; that God may rather be <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorified</a>, and <a href="../cathen/04710a.htm">demons</a> may not be honoured in that which I have done for the sake of God? If God sees that I have done it for His sake, He equally sees that I have been unwilling to <em>show</em> that I did it for His sake, and have in a manner made His precept  a <a href="../cathen/13309a.htm">sacrifice</a> to <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idols</a>. Many say, <q>No one ought to divulge himself;</q> but I think neither ought he to <em>deny</em> himself. For whoever dissembles in any <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> whatever, by being held as a <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathen</a>, does deny; and, of course, all denial is <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, just as all <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a> is denial, whether in <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a> or in words. </p>

<h2>Chapter 23. Written Contracts in the Name of Idols. Tacit Consent</h2>

<p>But there is a certain species of that class, doubly sharpened in deed and word, and mischievous on either side, although it flatter you, as if it were free of danger in each; while it does not seem to be a <em>deed</em>, because it is not laid hold of as a <em>word</em>. In borrowing money from <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a> under pledged  securities, <em><a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a></em> give a guarantee under <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">oath</a>, and deny themselves <em>to have done so</em>. Of course, the time of the prosecution, and the place of the judgment seat, and the person of the presiding judge, decide that they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> themselves <em>to have so done</em>.  Christ prescribes that there is to be no swearing. <q>I wrote,</q> says the debtor, <q>but I said nothing. It is the tongue, not the written letter, which kills.</q> Here I call Nature and Conscience as my witnesses: Nature, because even if the <em>tongue</em> in dictating remains motionless and quiet, the hand can write nothing which the <em><a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a></em> has not dictated; albeit even to the tongue itself the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> may have dictated either something conceived by itself, or else something delivered by another. Now, lest it be said, <q>Another dictated,</q> I here appeal to Conscience whether, what another dictated, the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> entertains,  and transmits unto the hand, whether with the concomitance or the inaction of the tongue. Enough, that the Lord has said faults are committed in the mind and the <a href="../cathen/04268a.htm">conscience</a>. If concupiscence or <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">malice</a> have ascended into a man's heart, He says it is held as a deed.  You therefore have given a guarantee; which clearly has <q>ascended into your heart,</q> which you can neither contend you were <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of nor unwilling; for when you gave the guarantee, you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> <em>that you did it</em>; when you <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a>, of course you were willing: you did it as well in act as in thought; nor can you by the lighter charge exclude the heavier,  so as to say that it is clearly rendered false, by giving a guarantee for what you do not actually perform. <q>Yet I have not denied, because I have not <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a>.</q> <em>But you have <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">sworn</a></em>, since, even if you had done no such thing, you would still be said to <a href="../cathen/11176a.htm">swear</a>, if you have even <em>consented</em> to so doing. Silence of voice is an unavailing plea in a case of <em>writing</em>; and muteness of sound in a case of <em>letters</em>. For Zacharias, when punished with a temporary privation of <em>voice</em>, holds colloquy with his <em>mind</em>, and, passing by his bootless tongue, with the help of his hands dictates from his heart, and without his mouth pronounces the name of his son.  Thus, in his pen there speaks a hand clearer than every sound, in his waxen tablet there is heard a letter more vocal that every mouth.  Inquire whether a man have <em>spoken</em> who is <em>understood</em> to have spoken.  Pray we the Lord that no necessity for that kind of contract may ever encompass us; and if it <em>should</em> so fall out, may He give our brethren the means of helping us, or give us constancy to break off all <em>such</em> necessity, lest those denying letters, the substitutes for our mouth, be brought forward against us in the day of judgment, sealed with the seals, not now of witnesses, but of <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>!</p>

<h2>Chapter 24. General Conclusion</h2>

<p>Amid these reefs and inlets, amid these shallows and straits of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, Faith, her sails filled by the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit of God</a>, navigates; safe if cautious, secure if intently watchful. But to such as are washed overboard is a deep whence is no out-swimming; to such as are run aground is inextricable shipwreck; to such as are engulphed is a whirlpool, where there is no breathing&mdash; even in <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. All waves thereof whatsoever suffocate; every eddy thereof sucks down unto Hades. Let no one say, <q>Who will so safely foreguard himself? We shall have to go out of the world!</q> <span class="stiki" id="note030342"><a href="../bible/1co005.htm#verse10">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;5:10</a></span> As if it were not as well worth while to go out, as to stand in the world as an idolater! Nothing can be easier than caution against <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>, if the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> of it be our leading <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a>; any <q>necessity</q> whatever is too trifling compared to such a peril. The reason why the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Spirit</a> did, when the <a href="../cathen/01626c.htm">apostles</a> at that time were consulting, relax the bond and yoke for us, <span class="stiki" id="note030343"><a href="../bible/act015.htm#verse1">Acts&nbsp;15:1-31</a></span> was that we might be free to devote ourselves to the shunning of <a href="../cathen/07636a.htm">idolatry</a>. This shall be our Law, the more fully to be administered the more ready it is to hand; (a Law) peculiar to <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christians</a>, by means whereof we are recognised and examined by <a href="../cathen/11388a.htm">heathens</a>. This Law must be set before such as approach unto the Faith, and inculcated on such as are entering it; that, in approaching, they may deliberate; observing it, may persevere; not observing it, may renounce their name.  We will see to it, if, after the type of the Ark, there shall be in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> raven, kite, dog, and serpent. At all events, an idolater is not found in the type of the Ark: no animal has been fashioned to represent an idolater. Let not that be in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> which was not in the Ark. </p>
