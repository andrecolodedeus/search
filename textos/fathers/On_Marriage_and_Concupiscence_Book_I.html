<h1>On Marriage and Concupiscence (Book I)</h1>

<p> <span class="stiki">Wherein He expounds the peculiar and natural blessings of marriage. He shows that among these blessings must not be reckoned fleshly concupiscence; insomuch as this is wholly <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, such as does not proceed from the very nature of marriage, but is an accident thereof arising from original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. This <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, notwithstanding, is rightly employed by marriage for the procreation of children. But, as the result of this concupiscence, it comes to pass that, even from the lawful marriage of the children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, men are not born children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but of the world, and are bound with the chain of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although their <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> have been liberated therefrom by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>; and are led captive by the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, if they be not in like manner rescued by the self-same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. He explains how it is that concupiscence remains in the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> in act though not in guilt. He teaches, that by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">sanctity</a> of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, not merely this original guilt, but all other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> of men whatever, are taken away. He lastly quotes the authority of Ambrose to show that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of concupiscence must be distinguished from the good of marriage.</span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 1.&mdash; Concerning the Argument of This Treatise.</h2>

<p>Our new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, my dearest son Valerius, who maintain that infants born in the flesh have no need of that medicine of Christ whereby <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are healed, are constantly affirming, in their excessive <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hatred</a> of us, that we condemn marriage and that divine procedure by which <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> creates <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings by means of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, inasmuch as we assert that they who are born of such a union contract that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of which the apostle says, <q>By one man <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> entered into the world, and death by <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and so death passed upon all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a>, for in him all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>;</q>  and because we do not deny, that of whatever kind of <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> they are born, they are still under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> dominion, unless they be born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and by His <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> be removed from the power of darkness and translated into His kingdom, <span class="stiki" id="note152061"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse15">Colossians&nbsp;1:15</a></span> who willed not to be born from the same union of the two sexes. Because, then, we affirm this doctrine, which is contained in the oldest and unvarying rule of the catholic <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, these propounders of the novel and perverse dogma, who assert that there is no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in infants to be washed away in the laver of regeneration,  <span class="stiki" id="note152062"><a href="../bible/tit003.htm#verse5">Titus&nbsp;3:5</a></span> in their unbelief or <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> <a href="../cathen/03190c.htm">calumniate</a> us, as if we condemned marriage, and as if we asserted to be the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> work what is God's own work&mdash; the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being which is born of marriage. Nor do they reflect that the good of marriage is no more impeachable on account of the original <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is derived therefrom, than the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> and fornication is excusable on account of the natural good which is born of them. For as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is the work of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, from whencesoever contracted by infants; so man is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, from whencesoever born. Our purpose, therefore, in this book, so far as the Lord vouchsafes us in His help, is to distinguish between the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of carnal concupiscence from which man who is born therefrom contracts original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and the good of marriage. For there would have been none of this shame-producing concupiscence, which is impudently praised by impudent men, if man had not previously <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>; while as to marriage, it would still have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> even if no man had <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, since the procreation of children in the body that belonged to that life would have been effected without that malady which in <q>the body of this death</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152063"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> cannot be separated from the process of procreation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2. [II.]&mdash; Why This Treatise Was Addressed to Valerius.</h2>

<p>Now there are three very special reasons, which I will briefly indicate, why I wished to write to you particularly on this subject. One is, because by the gift of Christ you are a strict observer of conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. Another is, because by your great care and diligence you have effectually withstood those profane novelties which we are resisting in our present discussion. The third is, because of my learning that something which they had committed to writing had found its way into your hands; and although in your robust <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> you could despise such an attempt, it is still a good thing for us also to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to bring aid to our <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> by defending it. For the Apostle Peter instructs us to be <q>ready always to give an answer to every one that asks us a reason of the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> and hope that is in us;</q>  and the <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">Apostle Paul</a> says, <q>Let your speech be always with <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, seasoned with <a href="../cathen/13403b.htm">salt</a>, that you may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how you ought to answer every man.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152065"><a href="../bible/col004.htm#verse6">Colossians&nbsp;4:6</a></span> These are the motives which chiefly impel me to hold such converse with you in this volume, as the Lord shall enable me. I have never liked, indeed, to intrude the perusal of any of my <a href="../cathen/07543b.htm">humble</a> labours on any eminent person, who is like yourself conspicuous to all from the elevation of his office, without his own request,&mdash; especially when he is not blessed with the enjoyment of a dignified retirement, but is still occupied in the public duties of a soldier's profession; this has always seemed to me to savour more impertinence than of respectful esteem. If, then, I have incurred censure of this kind, while acting on the reasons which I have now mentioned, I crave the favour of your forgiveness, and kindly regard to the following arguments.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3 [III.]&mdash; Conjugal Chastity the Gift of God.</h2>

<p>That <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in the married state is God's gift, is shown by the most <a href="../cathen/11567b.htm">blessed Paul</a>, when, speaking on this very subject, he says: <q>But I would that all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> were even as I myself: but every man has his proper gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, one after this manner, and another after that.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152066"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse7">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:7</a></span> Observe, he tells us that this gift is from <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and although he classes it below that continence in which he would have all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> to be like himself, he still describes it as a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. Whence we understand that, when these precepts are given to us in order that we should do them, nothing else is stated than that there ought to be within us our own will also for receiving and having them. When, therefore, these are shown to be gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, it is meant that they must be sought from Him if they are not already possessed; and if they are possessed, thanks must be given to Him for the possession; moreover, that our own wills have but small avail for seeking, obtaining, and holding fast these gifts, unless they be assisted by God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 4.&mdash; A Difficulty as Regards the Chastity of Unbelievers. None But a Believer is Truly a Chaste Man.</h2> 

<p>What, then, have we to say when conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is discovered even in some unbelievers? Must it be said that they <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, in that they make a bad use of a gift of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in not restoring it to the worship of Him from whom they received it? Or must these endowments, perchance, be not regarded as gifts of God at all, when they are not <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> who exercise them; according to the apostle's sentiment, when he says, <q>Whatsoever is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152068"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;14:23</a></span> But who would dare to say that a gift of God is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? For the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body, and all the natural endowments which are implanted in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> and the body, even in the <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of sinful men, are still gifts of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for it is God who made them, and not they themselves. When it is said, <q>Whatsoever is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> only those things are meant which men themselves do. When men, therefore, do without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> those things which seem to appertain to conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, they do them either to please men, whether themselves or others, or to avoid incurring such troubles as are incidental to <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> in those things which they corruptly desire, or to pay service to devils. Sins are not really resigned, but some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are overpowered by other <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. God forbid, then, that a man be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> called chaste who observes connubial fidelity to his wife from any other motive than devotion to the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5 [IV.]&mdash; The Natural Good of Marriage. All Society Naturally Repudiates a Fraudulent Companion. What is True Conjugal Purity? No True Virginity and Chastity Except in Devotion to True Faith.</h2>

<p>The union, then, of male and female for the purpose of procreation is the natural good of marriage. But he makes a bad use of this good who uses it bestially, so that his intention is on the gratification of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, instead of the desire of offspring. Nevertheless, in sundry animals unendowed with reason, as, for instance, in most birds, there is both preserved a certain kind of confederation of pairs, and a social combination of skill in nest-building; and their mutual division of the periods for cherishing their eggs and their alternation in the labor of feeding their young, give them the appearance of so acting, when they mate, as to be intent rather on securing the continuance of their kind than on gratifying <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Of these two, the one is the likeness of man in a brute; the other, the likeness of the brute in man. With respect, however, to what I ascribed to the <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> of marriage, that the male and the female are united together as associates for procreation, and consequently do not defraud each other (forasmuch as every associated state has a natural abhorrence of a fraudulent companion), although even men without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> possess this palpable blessing of nature, yet, since they use it not in <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, they only turn it to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. In like manner, therefore, the marriage of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> converts to the use of righteousness that carnal concupiscence by which <q>the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the Spirit.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152069"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> For they entertain the firm purpose of generating offspring to be regenerated&mdash; that the children who are born of them as <q>children of the world</q> may be born again and become <q>sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> Wherefore all <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> who do not beget children with this intention, this will, this purpose, of transferring them from being members of the first man into being members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, but boast as unbelieving <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> over unbelieving children&mdash;however circumspect they be in their cohabitation, studiously limiting it to the begetting of children&mdash;really have no conjugal <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> in themselves. For inasmuch as <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> is a <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtue</a>, hating unchastity as its contrary <a href="../cathen/15403c.htm">vice</a>, and as all the <a href="../cathen/15472a.htm">virtues</a> (even those whose operation is by means of the body) have their seat in the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>, how can the body be in any <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> sense said to be chaste, when the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> itself is committing fornication against the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> God? Now such fornication the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> psalmist censures when he says: <q>For, lo, they that are far from You shall perish: You have destroyed all them that go a whoring from You.</q>  There is, then, no <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, whether conjugal, or vidual, or virginal, except that which devotes itself to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>. For though <a href="../cathen/04276a.htm">consecrated</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virginity</a> is rightly preferred to marriage, yet what <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> in his sober mind would not prefer catholic <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> who have been even more than once married, to not only vestals, but also to <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> <a href="../cathen/15458a.htm">virgins</a>? So great is the avail of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, of which the apostle says, <q>Whatsoever is not of <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152071"><a href="../bible/rom014.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;14:23</a></span> and of which it is written in the Epistle to the Hebrews, <q>Without <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> it is impossible to please God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152072"><a href="../bible/heb011.htm#verse6">Hebrews&nbsp;11:6</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 6 [V.]&mdash; The Censuring of Lust is Not a Condemnation of Marriage; Whence Comes Shame in the Human Body. Adam and Eve Were Not Created Blind; Meaning of Their <q>Eyes Being Opened.</q></h2>

<p>Now, this being the real state of the question, they undoubtedly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">err</a> who suppose that, when fleshly <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> is censured, marriage is condemned; as if the malady of concupiscence was the outcome of marriage and not of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Were not those first spouses, whose nuptials God blessed with the words, <q>Be fruitful and multiply,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152073"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse28">Genesis&nbsp;1:28</a></span> naked, and yet not ashamed? Why, then, did shame arise out of their members after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, except because an indecent motion arose from them, which, if men had not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, would certainly never have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existed</a> in marriage? Or was it, forsooth, as some hold (who give little heed to what they read), that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> beings were, like dogs, at first created blind; and&mdash; absurder still&mdash; obtained sight, not as dogs do, by growing, but by sinning? Far be it from us to entertain such an opinion. But they gather that opinion of theirs from reading: <q>She took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat: and the eyes of them both were opened, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> that they were naked.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152074"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;3:6-7</a></span> This accounts for the opinion of unintelligent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, that the eyes of the first man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> were previously closed, because <a href="../bible/index.html">Holy Scripture</a> testifies that they were then opened. Well, then, were Hagar's eyes, the handmaid of Sarah, previously shut, when, with her thirsty and sobbing child, she opened her eyes <span class="stiki" id="note152075"><a href="../bible/gen021.htm#verse17">Genesis&nbsp;21:17-19</a></span> and saw the well? Or did those two <a href="../cathen/05029a.htm">disciples</a>, after the Lord's resurrection, walk in the way with Him with their eyes shut, since the <a href="../cathen/05645a.htm">evangelist</a> says of them that <q>in the breaking of bread their eyes were opened, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> Him</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152076"><a href="../bible/luk024.htm#verse31">Luke&nbsp;24:31</a></span> What, therefore, is written concerning the first man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, that <q>the eyes of them both were opened,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152077"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> we ought to understand as that they gave attention to perceiving and recognising the new state which had befallen their body. Now that their eyes were opened, their body appeared to them naked, and they <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it. If this were not the meaning, how, when the beast of the field and the fowls of the air were brought unto him, <span class="stiki" id="note152078"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse19">Genesis&nbsp;2:19</a></span> could <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> have given them names if his eyes were shut? He could not have done this without distinguishing them; and he could not distinguish them without seeing them. How, too, could the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> herself have been beheld so clearly by him when he said, <q>This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152079"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse23">Genesis&nbsp;2:23</a></span> If, indeed, any one shall be so determined on cavilling as to insist that <a href="../cathen/01129a.htm">Adam</a> might have acquired a discernment of these objects, not by sight but by touch, what explanation will he have to give of the passage wherein we are told how the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> <q>saw that the tree,</q> from which she was about to pluck the forbidden fruit, <q>was pleasant for the eyes to behold</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152080"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse6">Genesis&nbsp;3:6</a></span> No; <q>they were both naked, and were not ashamed,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152081"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse25">Genesis&nbsp;2:25</a></span> not because they had no eyesight, but because they perceived no reason to be ashamed in their members, which had all along been seen by them. For it is not said: They were both naked, <em>and <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knew</a> it not</em>; but <q>they were not ashamed.</q> Because, indeed, nothing had previously happened which was not lawful, so nothing had ensued which could <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> them shame.</p>

<h2>Chapter 7 [VI.]&mdash; Man's Disobedience Justly Requited in the Rebellion of His Own Flesh; The Blush of Shame for the Disobedient Members of the Body.</h2>

<p>When the first man transgressed the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, he began to have another law in his members which was repugnant to the law of his <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and he felt the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of his own disobedience when he experienced in the disobedience of his flesh a most righteous retribution recoiling on himself. Such, then, was <q>the opening of his eyes</q> which the serpent had promised him in his <a href="../cathen/14504a.htm">temptation</a> <span class="stiki" id="note152082"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse5">Genesis&nbsp;3:5</a></span> &mdash; the <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a>, in fact, of something which he had better been <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorant</a> of. Then, indeed, did man perceive within himself what he had done; then did he distinguish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> from good&mdash;not by avoiding it, but by enduring it. For it certainly was not just that <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> should be rendered by his servant, that is, his body, to him, who had not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> his own Lord. Well, then, how significant is the fact that the eyes, and lips, and tongue, and hands, and feet, and the bending of back, and neck, and sides, are all placed within our power&mdash; to be applied to such operations as are suitable to them, when we have a body free from impediments and in a sound state of health; but when it must come to man's great function of the procreation of children the members which were expressly created for this purpose will not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the direction of the will, but <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> has to be waited for to set these members in motion, as if it had legal right over them, and sometimes it refuses to act when the mind wills, while often it acts against its will! Must not this bring the blush of shame over the freedom of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> will, that by its contempt of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, its own Commander, it has lost all proper command for itself over its own members? Now, wherein could be found a more fitting demonstration of the just depravation of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/10715a.htm">nature</a> by reason of its disobedience, than in the disobedience of those parts whence nature herself derives subsistence by succession? For it is by a special propriety that those parts of the body are designated as <em>natural</em>. This, then, was the reason why the first <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> pair, on experiencing in the flesh that motion which was indecent because disobedient, and on feeling the shame of their nakedness, covered these offending members with fig-leaves; <span class="stiki" id="note152083"><a href="../bible/gen003.htm#verse7">Genesis&nbsp;3:7</a></span> in order that, at the very least, by the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the ashamed offenders, a veil might be thrown over that which was put into motion without the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of those who wished it: and since shame arose from what indecently pleased, decency might be attained by concealment.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8 [VII.]&mdash; The Evil of Lust Does Not Take Away the Good of Marriage.</h2>

<p>Forasmuch, then, as the good of marriage could not be lost by the addition of this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, some imprudent <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> suppose that this is not an added <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, but something which appertains to the original good. A distinction, however, occurs not only to subtle reason, but even to the most ordinary natural judgment, which was both apparent in the case of the first man and <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, and also holds good still in the case of married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> today. What they afterward effected in propagation&mdash;that is the good of marriage; but what they first veiled through shame&mdash;that is the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of concupiscence, which everywhere shuns sight, and in its shame seeks privacy. Since, therefore, marriage effects some good even out of that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it has whereof to <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glory</a>; but since the good cannot be effected without the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, it has reason for feeling shame. The case may be illustrated by the example of a lame man. Suppose him to attain to some good object by limping after it, then, on the one hand, the attainment itself is not <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> because of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of the man's lameness; nor, on the other hand, is the lameness good because of the goodness of the attainment. So, on the same principle, we ought not to condemn marriage because of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>; nor must we praise <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> because of the good of marriage.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9 [VIII.]&mdash; This Disease of Concupiscence in Marriage is Not to Be a Matter of Will, But of Necessity; What Ought to Be the Will of Believers in the Use of Matrimony; Who is to Be Regarded as Using, and Not Succumbing To, the Evil of Concupiscence; How the Holy Fathers of the Old Testament Formerly Used Wives.</h2>

<p>This disease of concupiscence is what the apostle refers to, when, speaking to married <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, he says: <q>This is the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication: that every one of you should <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> how to possess his vessel in sanctification and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>; not in the disease of desire, even as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not God.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152084"><a href="../bible/1th004.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Thessalonians&nbsp;4:3-5</a></span> The married believer, therefore, must not only not use another man's vessel, which is what they do who <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> after others' wives; but he must <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that even his own vessel is not to be possessed in the disease of carnal concupiscence. And this counsel is not to be understood as if the apostle prohibited conjugal&mdash; that is to say, lawful and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>&mdash; cohabitation; but so as that that cohabitation (which would have no adjunct of unwholesome <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, were it not that man's perfect freedom of choice had become by preceding <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> so disabled that it has this fatal adjunct) should not be a matter of will, but of necessity, without which, nevertheless, it would be impossible to attain to the fruition of the will itself in the procreation of children. And this wish is not in the marriages of <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> determined by the purpose of having such children born as shall pass through life in this present world, but such as shall be born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, and remain in Him for evermore. Now if this result should come about, the reward of a full felicity will spring from marriage; but if such result be not realized, there will yet ensue to the married pair the peace of their good will. Whosoever possesses his vessel (that is, his wife) with this intention of heart, certainly does not possess her in the <q>disease of desire,</q> as the <a href="../cathen/06422a.htm">Gentiles</a> which <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but in sanctification and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honour</a>, as <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> who <a href="../cathen/07465b.htm">hope</a> in <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. A man turns to use the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of concupiscence, and is not overcome by it, when he bridles and restrains its rage, as it works in inordinate and indecorous motions; and never relaxes his hold upon it except when intent on offspring, and then controls and applies it to the carnal generation of children to be spiritually regenerated, not to the subjection of the spirit to the flesh in a sordid servitude. That the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers of olden times after <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, and before him, to whom God gave His testimony that <q>they pleased Him,</q>  thus used their wives, no one who is a <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> ought to <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, since it was permitted to certain individuals among them to have a plurality of wives, where the reason was for the multiplication of their offspring, not the desire of varying gratification.</p>

<h2>Chapter 10 [IX.]&mdash; Why It Was Sometimes Permitted that a Man Should Have Several Wives, Yet No Woman Was Ever Allowed to Have More Than One Husband. Nature Prefers Singleness in Her Dominations.</h2>

<p>Now, if to the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> of our fathers, who is likewise our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, such a plurality of wives had not been displeasing for the purpose that <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> might have a fuller range of indulgence; then, on such a supposition, the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> also ought each to have rendered service to several husbands. But if any <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> had so acted, what feeling but that of a disgraceful concupiscence could impel her to have more husbands, seeing that by such licence she could not have more children? That the good purpose of marriage, however, is better promoted by one husband with one wife, than by a husband with several wives, is shown plainly enough by the very first union of a married pair, which was made by the Divine Being Himself, with the intention of marriages taking their beginning therefrom, and of its affording to them a more <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> precedent. In the advance, however, of the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>, it came to pass that to certain good men were united a plurality of good wives&mdash;many to each; and from this it would seem that moderation sought rather unity on one side for dignity, while nature permitted plurality on the other side for fecundity. For on natural principles it is more feasible for one to have dominion over many, than for many to have dominion over one. Nor can it be <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubted</a>, that it is more consonant with the order of nature that men should bear rule over <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, than <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> over men. It is with this principle in view that the apostle says, <q>The head of the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is the man;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152086"><a href="../bible/1co011.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;11:3</a></span> and, <q>Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152087"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse18">Colossians&nbsp;3:18</a></span> So also the Apostle Peter writes: <q>Even as Sara <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a> <a href="../cathen/01051a.htm">Abraham</a>, calling him lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152088"><a href="../bible/1pe003.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;3:6</a></span> Now, although the fact of the matter is, that while nature loves singleness in her dominations, but we may see plurality existing more readily in the subordinate portion of our race; yet for all that, it was at no time lawful for one man to have a plurality of wives, except for the purpose of a greater number of children springing from him. Wherefore, if one <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> cohabits with several men, inasmuch as no increase of offspring accrues to her therefrom, but only a more frequent gratification of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, she cannot possibly be a wife, but only a harlot.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11 [X.]&mdash; The Sacrament of Marriage; Marriage Indissoluble; The World's Law About Divorce Different from the Gospel's.</h2>

<p>It is certainly not fecundity only, the fruit of which consists of offspring, nor <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a> only, whose bond is fidelity, but also a certain sacramental bond  in marriage which is recommended to <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a> in wedlock. Accordingly it is enjoined by the apostle: <q>Husbands, <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> your wives, even as Christ also loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152090"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians&nbsp;5:25</a></span> Of this bond the substance  undoubtedly is this, that the man and the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> who are joined together in matrimony should remain inseparable as long as they live; and that it should be unlawful for one consort to be parted from the other, except for the <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of fornication. <span class="stiki" id="note152092"><a href="../bible/mat005.htm#verse32">Matthew&nbsp;5:32</a></span> For this is preserved in the case of Christ and the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>; so that, as a living one with a living one, there is no <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>, no separation for ever. And so complete is the observance of this bond in the city of our <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, in His <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> mountain &mdash; that is to say, in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>&mdash; by all married <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, who are undoubtedly members of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, that, although <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> marry, and men take wives, for the purpose of procreating children, it is never permitted one to put away even an unfruitful wife for the sake of having another to bear children. And whosoever does this is held to be guilty of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> by the law of the gospel; though not by this world's rule, which allows a <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> between the parties, without even the allegation of guilt, and the contraction of other nuptial engagements,&mdash; a concession which, the Lord tells us, even the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> <a href="../cathen/10596a.htm">Moses</a> extended to the people of <a href="../cathen/08193a.htm">Israel</a>, because of the hardness of their hearts. <span class="stiki" id="note152094"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse8">Matthew&nbsp;19:8</a></span> The same condemnation applies to the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>, if she is married to another man. So enduring, indeed, are the rights of marriage between those who have contracted them, as long as they both live, that even they are looked on as man and wife still, who have separated from one another, rather than they between whom a new connection has been formed. For by this new connection they would not be guilty of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, if the previous matrimonial relation did not still continue. If the husband die, with whom a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage was made, a <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> marriage is now possible by a connection which would before have been <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>. Thus between the conjugal pair, as long as they live, the nuptial bond has a permanent obligation, and can be cancelled neither by separation nor by union with another. But this permanence avails, in such cases, only for injury from the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, not for a bond of the covenant. In like manner the <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a> of an <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostate</a>, which renounces as it were its marriage union with Christ, does not, even though it has cast its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> away, lose the sacrament of its <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>, which it received in the laver of regeneration. It would undoubtedly be given back to him if he were to return, although he lost it on his departure from Christ. He retains, however, the sacrament after his <a href="../cathen/01624b.htm">apostasy</a>, to the aggravation of his punishment, not for meriting the reward.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12 [XI.]&mdash; Marriage Does Not Cancel a Mutual Vow of Continence; There Was True Wedlock Between Mary and Joseph; In What Way Joseph Was the Father of Christ.</h2>

<p>But God forbid that the nuptial bond should be regarded as broken between those who have by mutual consent agreed to observe a perpetual abstinence from the use of carnal concupiscence. Nay, it will be only a firmer one, whereby they have exchanged pledges together, which will have to be kept by a special endearment and concord&mdash;not by the voluptuous links of bodies, but by the <a href="../cathen/15506a.htm">voluntary</a> affections of <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">souls</a>. For it was not deceitfully that the <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angel</a> said to Joseph: <q>Fear not to take unto you Mary your wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152095"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse20">Matthew&nbsp;1:20</a></span> She is called his wife because of her first troth of betrothal, although he had had no carnal <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of her, nor was destined to have. The designation of wife was neither destroyed nor made untrue, where there never had been, nor was meant to be, any carnal connection. That virgin wife was rather a holier and more wonderful <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a> to her husband because of her very pregnancy without man, with disparity as to the child that was born, without disparity in the <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> they cherished. And because of this conjugal fidelity they are both deservedly called <q><a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a></q> <span class="stiki" id="note152096"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;2:41</a></span> of Christ (not only she as His mother, but he as His father, as being her husband), both having been such in mind and purpose, though not in the flesh. But while the one was His father in purpose only, and the other His mother in the flesh also, they were both of them, for all that, only the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of His humility, not of His sublimity; of His weakness, not of His divinity. For the <a href="../cathen/06655b.htm">Gospel</a> does not lie, in which one reads, <q>Both His father and His mother marvelled at those things which were spoken about Him;</q>  and in another passage, <q>Now His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> went to Jerusalem every year;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152098"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse41">Luke&nbsp;2:41</a></span> and again a little afterwards, <q>His mother said unto Him, Son, why have You thus dealt with us? Behold, Your father and I have sought You sorrowing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152099"><a href="../bible/luk002.htm#verse48">Luke&nbsp;2:48</a></span> In order, however, that He might show them that He had a Father besides them, who begot Him without a mother, He said to them in answer: <q>How is it that you sought me?

And who was the subject but <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, <q>who, being in the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, thought it not <a href="../cathen/14564b.htm">robbery</a> to be equal with God</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152102"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse6">Philippians&nbsp;2:6</a></span> And wherefore subject to them,who were far beneath the form of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except that <q>He emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152103"><a href="../bible/phi002.htm#verse7">Philippians&nbsp;2:7</a></span> &mdash; the form in which His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> lived? Now, since she bore Him without his engendering, they could not surely have both been His <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, of that form of a servant, if they had not been conjugally united, though without carnal connection. Accordingly the genealogical series (although both <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of Christ are mentioned together in the succession) <span class="stiki" id="note152104"><a href="../bible/mat001.htm#verse16">Matthew&nbsp;1:16</a></span> had to be extended, as it is in fact,  down rather to Joseph's name, that no wrong might be done, in the case of this marriage, to the male, and indeed the stronger sex, while at the same time there was nothing detrimental to <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, since Joseph, no less than Mary, was of the seed of <a href="../cathen/04642b.htm">David</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note152106"><a href="../bible/luk001.htm#verse27">Luke&nbsp;1:27</a></span> of whom it was foretold that Christ should come.</p>

<h2>Chapter 13.&mdash; In the Marriage of Mary and Joseph There Were All the Blessings of the Wedded State; All that is Born of Concubinage is Sinful Flesh.</h2>

<p>The entire good, therefore, of the nuptial institution was effected in the case of these <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> of Christ: there was offspring, there was faithfulness, there was the bond.  As offspring, we recognise the Lord Jesus Himself; the fidelity, in that there was no <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>; the bond,  because there was no <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a>. [XII.] Only there was no nuptial cohabitation; because He who was to be without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and was sent not in sinful flesh, but in <em>the likeness</em> of sinful flesh, <span class="stiki" id="note152109"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse3">Romans&nbsp;8:3</a></span> could not possibly have been made in sinful flesh itself without that shameful <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh which comes from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and without which He willed to be born, in order that He might teach us, that every one who is born of sexual intercourse is in fact sinful flesh, since that alone which was not born of such intercourse was not sinful flesh. Nevertheless conjugal intercourse is not in itself <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, when it is had with the intention of producing children; because the mind's good-will leads the ensuing bodily pleasure, instead of following its lead; and the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> choice is not distracted by the yoke of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> pressing upon it, inasmuch as the blow of the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is rightly brought back to the purposes of procreation. This blow has a certain prurient activity which plays the king in the foul indulgences of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, and fornication, and lasciviousness, and uncleanness; while in the indispensable duties of the marriage state, it exhibits the docility of the slave. In the one case it is condemned as the shameless effrontery of so violent a master; in the other, it gets modest praise as the honest service of so submissive an attendant. This <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, then, is not in itself the good of the nuptial institution; but it is obscenity in sinful men, a necessity in procreant <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a>, the fire of lascivious indulgences, the shame of nuptial pleasures. Wherefore, then, may not <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> remain man and wife when they cease by mutual consent from cohabitation; seeing that <a href="../cathen/08504a.htm">Joseph</a> and <a href="../cathen/15464b.htm">Mary</a> continued such, though they never even began to cohabit?</p>

<h2>Chapter 14 [XIII.]&mdash; Before Christ It Was a Time for Marrying; Since Christ It Has Been a Time for Continence.</h2>

<p>Now this propagation of children which among the ancient <a href="../cathen/04171a.htm">saints</a> was a most bounden duty for the purpose of begetting and preserving a people for <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, among whom the <a href="../cathen/12473a.htm">prophecy</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ's</a> coming must needs have had precedence over everything, now has no longer the same necessity. For from among all nations the way is open for an abundant offspring to receive spiritual regeneration, from whatever quarter they derive their natural birth. So that we may acknowledge that the scripture which says there is <q>a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152110"><a href="../bible/ecc003.htm#verse5">Ecclesiastes&nbsp;3:5</a></span> is to be distributed in its clauses to the periods before Christ and since. The former was the time to embrace, the latter to refrain from embracing.</p>

<h2>Chapter 15.&mdash; The Teaching of the Apostle on This Subject.</h2>

<p>Accordingly the apostle also, speaking apparently with this passage in view, declares: <q>But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had them not; and they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; and they that use this world, as though they used it not: for the fashion of this world passes away. But I would have you without solicitude.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152111"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse29">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:29-31</a></span> This entire passage (that I may express my view on this subject in the shape of a brief exposition of the apostle's words) I think must be understood as follows: <q>This I say, brethren, the time is short.</q> No longer is God's people to be propagated by carnal generation; but, henceforth, it is to be gathered out by spiritual regeneration. <q>It remains, therefore, that they that have wives</q> be not subject to carnal concupiscence; <q>and they that weep,</q> under the sadness of present <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, should <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a> in the hope of future blessing; <q>and they that <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">rejoice</a>,</q> over any temporary advantage, should <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> the <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> judgment; <q>and they that buy,</q> should so hold their possessions as not to cleave to them by overmuch <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>; <q>and they that use this world</q> should reflect that it is passing away, and does not remain. <q>For the fashion of this world passes away: but,</q> he says, <q>I would have you to be without solicitude,</q>&mdash; in other words: I would have you lift up your heart, that it may dwell among those things which do not pass away. He then goes on to say: <q>He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: but he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152112"><a href="../bible/1co003.htm#verse32">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;3:32-33</a></span> And thus to some extent he explains what he had already said: <q>Let them that have wives be as though they had none.</q> For they who have wives in such a way as to care for the things of the Lord, how they may please the Lord, without having any care for the things of the world in order to please their wives, are, in fact, just as if they had no wives. And this is effected with greater ease when the wives, too, are of such a disposition, because they please their husbands not merely because they are rich, because they are high in rank, noble in race, and amiable in natural temper, but because they are <a href="../cathen/05769a.htm">believers</a>, because they are religious, because they are chaste, because they are good men.</p>

<h2>Chapter 16 [XIV.]&mdash; A Certain Degree of Intemperance is to Be Tolerated in the Case of Married Persons; The Use of Matrimony for the Mere Pleasure of Lust is Not Without Sin, But Because of the Nuptial Relation the Sin is Venial.</h2>

<p>But in the married, as these things are desirable and praiseworthy, so the others are to be tolerated, that no lapse occur into damnable <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; that is, into fornications and adulteries. To escape this <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, even such embraces of husband and wife as have not procreation for their object, but serve an overbearing concupiscence, are permitted, so far as to be within range of forgiveness, though not prescribed by way of commandment: <span class="stiki" id="note152113"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse6">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:6</a></span> and the married pair are enjoined not to defraud one the other, lest <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> should tempt them by reason of their incontinence. <span class="stiki" id="note152114"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse5">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:5</a></span> For thus says the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a>: <q>Let the husband render unto the wife her due:  and likewise also the wife unto the husband. The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife. Defraud not one the other; except it be with consent for a time, that you may have leisure for <a href="../cathen/12345b.htm">prayer</a>;  and then come together again, that <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">Satan</a> tempt you not for your incontinency. But I speak this by permission,  and not of commandment.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152118"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse3">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:3-6</a></span> Now in a case where permission  must be given, it cannot by any means be contended that there is not some amount of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Since, however, the cohabitation for the purpose of procreating children, which must be admitted to be the proper end of marriage, is not sinful, what is it which the apostle allows to be permissible,  but that married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, when they have not the gift of continence, may require one from the other the due of the flesh&mdash; and that not from a wish for procreation, but for the pleasure of concupiscence? This gratification incurs not the imputation of guilt on account of marriage, but receives permission  on account of marriage. This, therefore, must be reckoned among the praises of matrimony; that, on its own account, it makes pardonable that which does not essentially appertain to itself. For the nuptial embrace, which subserves the demands of concupiscence, is so effected as not to impede the child-bearing, which is the end and aim of marriage.</p>

<h2>Chapter 17 [XV.]&mdash; What is Sinless in the Use of Matrimony? What is Attended With Venial Sin, and What with Mortal?</h2>

<p>It is, however, one thing for married <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> to have intercourse only for the wish to beget children, which is not sinful: it is another thing for them to desire carnal pleasure in cohabitation, but with the spouse only, which involves venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For although propagation of offspring is not the motive of the intercourse, there is still no attempt to prevent such propagation, either by wrong desire or <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> appliance. They who resort to these, although called by the name of spouses, are really not such; they retain no vestige of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> matrimony, but pretend the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> designation as a cloak for criminal conduct. Having also proceeded so far, they are betrayed into exposing their children, which are born against their will. They <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a> to nourish and retain those whom they were afraid they would beget. This infliction of cruelty on their offspring so reluctantly begotten, unmasks the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which they had practised in darkness, and drags it clearly into the light of day. The open cruelty reproves the concealed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Sometimes, indeed, this lustful cruelty, or, if you please, cruel <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, resorts to such extravagant methods as to use poisonous drugs to secure barrenness; or else, if unsuccessful in this, to destroy the conceived seed by some means previous to birth, preferring that its offspring should rather perish than receive vitality; or if it was advancing to life within the womb, should be slain before it was born. Well, if both parties alike are so flagitious, they are not husband and wife; and if such were their character from the beginning, they have not come together by wedlock but by debauchery. But if the two are not alike in such <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, I boldly declare either that the <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> is, so to say, the husband's harlot; or the man the wife's adulterer.</p>

<h2>Chapter 18 [XVI.]&mdash; Continence Better Than Marriage; But Marriage Better Than Fornication.</h2>

<p>Forasmuch, then, as marriage cannot be such as that of the primitive men might have been, if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had not preceded; it may yet be like that of the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> fathers of the olden time, in such wise that the carnal concupiscence which causes shame (which did not exist in paradise previous to the fall, and after that event was not allowed to remain there), although necessarily forming a part of the body of this death, is not subservient to it, but only submits its function, when forced thereto, for the sole purpose of assisting in the procreation of children; otherwise, since the present time (as we have already  said) is the period for abstaining from the nuptial embrace, and therefore makes no necessary demand on the exercise of the said function, seeing that all nations now contribute so abundantly to the production of an offspring which shall receive spiritual birth, there is the greater room for the blessing of an excellent continence. <q>He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152123"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;19:12</a></span> He, however, who cannot receive it, <q>even if he marry, <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> not;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152124"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse28">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:28</a></span> and if a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> have not the gift of continence, let her also marry. <span class="stiki" id="note152125"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse9">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:9</a></span> <q>It is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, indeed, for a man not to touch a <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152126"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse1">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:1</a></span> But since <q>all <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">men</a> cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152127"><a href="../bible/mat019.htm#verse9">Matthew&nbsp;19:9</a></span> it remains that <q>to avoid fornication, every man ought to have his own wife, and every <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">woman</a> her own husband.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152128"><a href="../bible/1co007.htm#verse2">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;7:2</a></span> And thus the weakness of incontinence is hindered from falling into the ruin of profligacy by the <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> estate of matrimony. Now that which the apostle says of <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a>, <q>I will therefore that the younger <a href="../cathen/15687b.htm">women</a> marry,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152129"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:14</a></span> is also applicable to males: I will that the younger men take wives; that so it may appertain to both sexes alike <q>to bear children, to be</q> fathers and <q>mothers of <a href="../cathen/05782a.htm">families</a>, to give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152130"><a href="../bible/1ti005.htm#verse14">1&nbsp;Timothy&nbsp;5:14</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 19 [XVII.]&mdash; Blessing of Matrimony.</h2>

<p>In matrimony, however, let these nuptial blessings be the objects of our <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a>&mdash; offspring, fidelity, the sacramental bond.  Offspring, not that it be born only, but born again; for it is born to punishment unless it be born again to life. Fidelity, not such as even unbelievers observe one towards the other, in their ardent <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the flesh. For what husband, however impious himself, likes an adulterous wife? Or what wife, however impious she be, likes an adulterous husband? This is indeed a natural good in marriage, though a carnal one. But a member of Christ ought to be afraid of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, not on account of himself, but of his spouse; and ought to hope to receive from Christ the reward of that fidelity which he shows to his spouse. The sacramental bond, again, which is lost neither by <a href="../cathen/05054c.htm">divorce</a> nor by <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, should be guarded by husband and wife with concord and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>. For it alone is that which even an unfruitful marriage retains by the law of <a href="../cathen/12748a.htm">piety</a>, now that all that hope of fruitfulness is lost for the purpose of which the couple married. Let these nuptial blessings be praised in marriage by him who wishes to extol the nuptial institution. Carnal concupiscence, however, must not be ascribed to marriage: it is only to be tolerated in marriage. It is not a good which comes out of the <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">essence</a> of marriage, but an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which is the accident of original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 20 [XVIII]&mdash; Why Children of Wrath are Born of Holy Matrimony.</h2>

<p>This is the reason, indeed, why of even the just and lawful marriages of the children of God are born, not children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but children of the world; because also those who generate, if they are already regenerate, beget children not as children  of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but as still children of the world. <q>The children of this world,</q> says our Lord, <q>beget and are begotten.</q>  From the fact, therefore, that we are still children of this world, our outer man is in a state of corruption; and on this account our offspring are born as children of the present world; nor do they become sons of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, except they be regenerated.  Yet inasmuch as we are children of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, our inner man is renewed from day to day. <span class="stiki" id="note152134"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> And yet even our outer man has been sanctified through the laver of regeneration, and has received the hope of future incorruption, on which account it is <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">justly</a> designated as <q>the temple of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>.</q> <q>Your bodies,</q> says the apostle, <q>are the temples of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, which is in you, and which you have of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and you are not your own, for you are bought with a great price: therefore glorify and carry God in your body.</q>  The whole of this statement is made in reference to our present sanctification, but especially in consequence of that hope of which he says in another passage, <q>We ourselves also, which have the <a href="../cathen/06082a.htm">first-fruits</a> of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152136"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;8:23</a></span> If, then, the redemption of our body is expected, as the apostle declares, it follows, that being an expectation, it is as yet a matter of hope, and not of actual possession. Accordingly the apostle adds: <q>For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152137"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;8:24-25</a></span> Not, therefore, by that which we are waiting for, but by that which we are now enduring, are the children of our flesh born. God forbid that a man who possesses <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> should, when he hears the apostle bid men <q><a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> their wives,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152138"><a href="../bible/col003.htm#verse19">Colossians&nbsp;3:19</a></span> <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that carnal concupiscence in his wife which he ought not to <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> even in himself; as he may <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a>, if he listens to the words of another apostle: <q>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> the world, the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the eyes, and the <a href="../cathen/12405a.htm">pride</a> of life, is not of the <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">Father</a>, but is of the world. And the world passes away, and the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> thereof: but he that does the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a> abides for ever, even as also God abides for ever.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 21 [XIX.]&mdash; Thus Sinners are Born of Righteous Parents, Even as Wild Olives Spring from the Olive.</h2>

<p>That, therefore, which is born of the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of the flesh is really born of the world, and not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; but it is born of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, when it is born again of water and of the Spirit. The guilt of this concupiscence, regeneration alone remits, even as natural generation contracts it. What, then, is generated must be regenerated, in order that likewise since it cannot be otherwise, what has been contracted may be remitted. It is, no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a>, very wonderful that what has been remitted in the parent should still be contracted in the offspring; but nevertheless such is the case. That this <a href="../cathen/10662a.htm">mysterious</a> verity, which unbelievers neither see nor <a href="../cathen/02408b.htm">believe</a>, might get some palpable evidence in its support, God in His <a href="../cathen/12510a.htm">providence</a> has secured in the example of certain trees. For why should we not suppose that for this very purpose the wild olive springs from the olive? Is it not indeed credible that, in a thing which has been created for the use of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">mankind</a>, the Creator provided and appointed what should afford an instructive example, applicable to the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a>? It is a wonderful thing, then, how those who have been themselves delivered by <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> from the bondage of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, should still beget those who are tied and bound by the self-same chain, and who require the same process of loosening? Yes; and we admit the wonderful fact. But that the embryo of wild olive trees should latently exist in the germs of <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> olives, who would deem credible, if it were not <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proved</a> <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> by experiment and observation? In the same manner, therefore, as a wild olive grows out of the seed of the wild olive, and from the seed of the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> olive springs also nothing but a wild olive, notwithstanding the very great difference there is between the wild olive and the olive; so what is born in the flesh, either of a sinner or of a <a href="../cathen/08571c.htm">just</a> man, is in both instances a sinner, notwithstanding the vast distinction which exists between the sinner and the righteous man. He that is begotten is no sinner as yet in act, and is still new from his birth; but in guilt he is old. Human from the Creator, he is a captive of the destroyer, and needs a redeemer. The difficulty, however, is how a state of captivity can possibly befall the offspring, when the <a href="../cathen/11478c.htm">parents</a> have been themselves previously redeemed from it. Now it is no easy matter to unravel this intricate point, or to explain it in a set discourse; therefore unbelievers refuse to accept it as <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>; just as if in that other point about the wild olive and the olive, which we gave in illustration, any reason could be easily found, or explanation clearly given, why the self-same shoot should sprout out of so dissimilar a stock. The <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a>, however, of this can be discovered by any one who is willing to make the experiment. Let it then serve for a good example for suggesting belief of what admits not of ocular demonstration.</p>

<h2>Chapter 22 [XX.]&mdash; Even Infants, When Unbaptized, are in the Power of the Devil; Exorcism in the Case of Infants, and Renunciation of the Devil.</h2>

<p>Now the <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> unfalteringly declares, what our new <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a> have begun to deny, both that they who are cleansed in the laver of regeneration are redeemed from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, and that those who have not yet been redeemed by such regeneration are still captive in the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, even if they be infant children of the redeemed, unless they be themselves redeemed by the self-same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>. For we cannot <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> that that blessing of God applies to every stage of <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> life, which the apostle describes when he says concerning Him: <q>Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of His dear Son.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152140"><a href="../bible/col001.htm#verse13">Colossians&nbsp;1:13</a></span> From this power of darkness, therefore, of which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is the prince&mdash;in other words, from the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> and his <a href="../cathen/01476d.htm">angels</a>&mdash;infants are delivered when they are <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>; and whosoever denies this, is convicted by the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> of the Church's very <a href="../cathen/13295a.htm">sacraments</a>, which no <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretical</a> novelty in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> of <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a> is permitted to destroy or change, so long as the Divine Head rules and helps the entire body which He owns&mdash; small as well as great. It is <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a>, then, and in no way false, that the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power is exorcised in infants, and that they renounce him by the hearts and mouths of those who bring them to <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, being unable to do so by their own; in order that they may be delivered from the power of darkness, and be translated into the kingdom of their Lord. What is that, therefore, within them which keeps them in the power of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> until they are delivered from it by Christ's sacrament of <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>? What is it, I ask, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? Nothing else, indeed, has the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> found which enables him to put under his own control that nature of man which the good Creator made good. But infants have committed no <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> of their own since they have been alive.

<h2>Chapter 23 [XXI.]&mdash; Sin Has Not Arisen Out of the Goodness of Marriage; The Sacrament of Matrimony a Great One in the Case of Christ and the Church&mdash; A Very Small One in the Case of a Man and His Wife.</h2>

<p>If now we interrogate, so to speak, those goods of marriage to which we have often referred,  and inquire how it is that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> could possibly have been propagated from them to infants, we shall get this answer from the first of them&mdash; the work of procreation of offspring: <q>My <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">happiness</a> would in paradise have been greater if <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had not been committed. For to me belongs that blessing of almighty God: 'Be fruitful, and multiply.' <span class="stiki" id="note152143"><a href="../bible/gen001.htm#verse29">Genesis&nbsp;1:29</a></span> For accomplishing this good work, various members were created suited to each sex; these members were, of course, in <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> before <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but they were not objects of shame.</q> This will be the answer of the second good&mdash; the fidelity of <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>: <q>If <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> had not been committed, what in paradise could have been more secure than myself, when there was no <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of my own to spur me, none of another to tempt me?</q> And then this will be the answer of the sacramental bond of marriage,&mdash; the third good: <q>Of me was that word spoken in paradise before the entrance of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>: 'A man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they two shall become one flesh.'</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152144"><a href="../bible/gen002.htm#verse24">Genesis&nbsp;2:24</a></span> This the apostle applies to the case of Christ and of the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and calls it then <q>a great sacrament.</q>  What, then, in Christ and in the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> is great, in the instances of each married pair it is but very small, but even then it is the sacrament of an inseparable union. What now is there in these three blessings of marriage out of which the bond of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> could pass over to posterity? Absolutely nothing. And in these blessings it is certain that the goodness of matrimony is entirely comprised; and even now good wedlock consists of these same blessings.</p>

<h2>Chapter 24.&mdash; Lust and Shame Come from Sin; The Law of Sin; The Shamelessness of the Cynics.</h2>

<p>But if, in like manner, the question be asked of the concupiscence of the flesh, how it is that acts now bring shame which once were free from shame, will not her answer be, that she only began to have <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a> in men's members after <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>? [XXII.] And, therefore, that the apostle designated her influence as <q>the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152146"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;7:23</a></span> inasmuch as she subjugated man to herself when he was unwilling to remain subject to his <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; and that it was she who made the first married pair ashamed at that moment when they covered their loins; even as all are still ashamed, and seek out secret retreats for cohabitation, and dare not have even the children, whom they have themselves thus begotten, to be witnesses of what they do. It was against this modesty of natural shame that the Cynic <a href="../cathen/12025c.htm">philosophers</a>, in the <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">error</a> of their astonishing shamelessness, struggled so hard: they thought that the intercourse indeed of husband and wife, since it was lawful and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a>, should therefore be done in public. Such barefaced obscenity deserved to receive the name of dogs; and so they went by the title of <q> <em><a href="../cathen/04582a.htm">Cynics</a></em>.</q> </p>

<h2>Chapter 25 [XXIII.]&mdash; Concupiscence in the Regenerate Without Consent is Not Sin; In What Sense Concupiscence is Called Sin.</h2>

<p>Now this concupiscence, this law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which dwells in our members, to which the law of righteousness forbids allegiance, saying in the words of the apostle, <q>Let not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore, reign in your mortal body, that you should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> it in the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof; neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>:</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152148"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;6:12-13</a></span> &mdash; this concupiscence, I say, which is cleansed only by the sacrament of regeneration, does undoubtedly, by means of natural birth, pass on the bond of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> to a man's posterity, unless they are themselves loosed from it by regeneration. In the case, however, of the regenerate, concupiscence is not itself <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> any longer, whenever they do not consent to it for illicit works, and when the members are not applied by the presiding mind to perpetrate such <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>. So that, if what is enjoined in one passage, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>,</q>  is not kept, that at any rate is observed which is commanded in another place, <q>You shall not go after your concupiscences.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152150"><a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse30">Sirach&nbsp;18:30</a></span> Inasmuch, however, as by a certain manner of speech it is called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, since it arose from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, and, when it has the upper hand, produces <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, the guilt of it prevails in the natural man; but this guilt, by Christ's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> through the remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, is not suffered to prevail in the regenerate man, if he does not yield <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to it whenever it urges him to the commission of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>. As arising from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, it is, I say, called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, although in the regenerate it is not actually <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; and it has this designation applied to it, just as speech which the tongue produces is itself called <q> <em>tongue</em>;</q> and just as the word <q> <em>hand</em></q> is used in the sense of writing, which the hand produces. In the same way concupiscence is called <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as producing <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> when it conquers the will: so to cold and frost the epithet <q> <em>sluggish</em></q> is given; not as arising from, but as productive of, sluggishness; benumbing us, in fact.</p>

<h2>Chapter 26.&mdash; Whatever is Born Through Concupiscence is Not Undeservedly in Subjection to the Devil by Reason of Sin; The Devil Deserves Heavier Punishment Than Men.</h2>

<p>This wound which the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> has inflicted on the <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human race</a> compels everything which has its birth in consequence of it to be under the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil's</a> power, as if he were rightly plucking fruit off his own tree. Not as if man's nature, which is only of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, came from him, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> alone, which is not of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>. For it is not on its own account that man's nature is under condemnation, because it is the work of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, and therefore laudable; but on account of that condemnable corruption by which it has been vitiated. Now it is by reason of this condemnation that it is in subjection to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, who is also in the same damnable state. For the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> is himself an unclean spirit: good, indeed, so far as he is a spirit, but <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> as being unclean; for by nature he is a spirit, by the corruption thereof an unclean one. Of these two, the one is of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the other of himself. His hold over men, therefore, whether of an advanced age or in infancy, is not because they are <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a>, but because they are polluted. He, then, who feels surprise that God's creature is a subject of the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, should cease from such feeling. For one creature of God is in subjection to another creature of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, the less to the greater, a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> being to an angelic one; and this is not owing to nature, but to a corruption of nature: polluted is the sovereign, polluted also the subject. All this is the fruit of that ancient stock of pollution which he has planted in man; himself being destined to suffer a heavier punishment at the last judgment, as being the more polluted; but at the same time even they who will have to bear a less heavy burden in that condemnation are subjects of him as the prince and author of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, for there will be no other <a href="../cathen/03459a.htm">cause</a> of condemnation than <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 27 [XXIV.]&mdash; Through Lust Original Sin is Transmitted; Venial Sins in Married Persons; Concupiscence of the Flesh, the Daughter and Mother of Sin.</h2>

<p>Wherefore the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a> holds infants guilty who are born, not of the good by which marriage is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>, but of the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> of concupiscence, which, indeed, marriage uses aright, but at which even marriage has occasion to feel shame. Marriage is itself <q><a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> in all</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152151"><a href="../bible/heb013.htm#verse4">Hebrews&nbsp;13:4</a></span> the goods which properly appertain to it; but even when it has its <q>bed undefiled</q> (not only by fornication and <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, which are damnable disgraces, but also by any of those excesses of cohabitation such as do not arise from any prevailing desire of children, but from an overbearing <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of pleasure, which are venial <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> in man and wife), yet, whenever it comes to the actual process of generation, the very embrace which is lawful and <a href="../cathen/07462a.htm">honourable</a> cannot be effected without the ardour of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>, so as to be able to accomplish that which appertains to the use of reason and not of <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a>. Now, this ardour, whether following or preceding the will, does somehow, by a power of its own, move the members which cannot be moved simply by the will, and in this manner it shows itself not to be the servant of a will which commands it, but rather to be the punishment of a will which disobeys it. It shows, moreover, that it must be excited, not by a free choice, but by a certain seductive stimulus, and that on this very account it produces shame. This is the carnal concupiscence, which, while it is no longer accounted <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the regenerate, yet in no case happens to nature except from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. It is the daughter of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, as it were; and whenever it yields assent to the commission of shameful <a href="../cathen/01115a.htm">deeds</a>, it becomes also the mother of many <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>. Now from this concupiscence whatever comes into being by natural birth is bound by original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, unless, indeed, it be born again in Him whom the Virgin conceived without this concupiscence. Wherefore, when He vouchsafed to be born in the flesh, He alone was born without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 28 [XXV.]&mdash; Concupiscence Remains After Baptism, Just as Languor Does After Recovery from Disease; Concupiscence is Diminished in Persons of Advancing Years, and Increased in the Incontinent.</h2>

<p>If the question arises, how this concupiscence of the flesh remains in the regenerate, in whose case has been effected a remission of all <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> whatever; seeing that <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> semination takes place by its means, even when the carnal offspring of even a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> parent is born: or, at all events, if it may be in the case of a <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> parent concupiscence and not be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, why should this same concupiscence be <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in the offspring?&mdash; the answer to be given is this: Carnal concupiscence is remitted, indeed, in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>; not so that it is put out of <a href="../cathen/05543b.htm">existence</a>, but so that it is not to be imputed for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Although its guilt is now taken away, it still remains until our entire infirmity be healed by the advancing renewal of our inner man, day by day, when at last our outward man shall be clothed with incorruption. <span class="stiki" id="note152152"><a href="../bible/1co015.htm#verse53">1&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;15:53</a></span> It does not remain, however, substantially, as a body, or a spirit; but it is nothing more than a certain affection of an <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> quality, such as languor, for instance. There is not, to be sure, anything remaining which may be remitted whenever, as the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> says, <q>the Lord forgives all our iniquities.</q>  But until that happens which immediately follows in the same passage, <q>Who heals all your infirmities, who redeems your life from corruption,</q>  there remains this concupiscence of the flesh in the body of this death. Now we are admonished not to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> its sinful desires to do <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>: <q>Let not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> reign in your mortal body.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152155"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;6:12</a></span> Still this concupiscence is daily lessened in <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> of continence and increasing years, and most of all when old age makes a near approach. The man, however, who yields to it a <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">wicked</a> service, receives such great energies that, even when all his members are now failing through age, and those special parts of his body are unable to be applied to their proper function, he does not ever cease to revel in a still increasing rage of disgraceful and shameless desire.</p>

<h2>Chapter 29 [XXVI.]&mdash; How Concupiscence Remains in the Baptized in Act, When It Has Passed Away as to Its Guilt.</h2>

<p>In the case, then, of those <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a> who are born again in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ</a>, when they receive an entire remission of all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it is of course necessary that the guilt also of the still indwelling concupiscence should be remitted, in order that (as I said) it should not be imputed to them for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For even as in the case of those <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> which cannot be themselves permanent, since they pass away as soon as they are committed, the guilt yet is permanent, and (if not remitted) will remain for evermore; so, when the concupiscence is remitted, the guilt of it also is taken away. For not to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> means this, not to be deemed guilty of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. If a man have (for example) committed <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a>, though he do not repeat the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, he is held to be guilty of <a href="../cathen/01163a.htm">adultery</a> until the indulgence in guilt be itself remitted. He has the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, therefore, remaining, although the particular act of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> no longer exists, since it has passed away along with the time when it was committed. For if to desist from sinning were the same thing as not to have <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it would be sufficient if Scripture were content to give us the simple warning, <q>My son, have you <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>? Do so no more.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152156"><a href="../bible/sir021.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;21:1</a></span> This, however, does not suffice, for it goes on to say, <q>Ask forgiveness for your former <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152157"><a href="../bible/sir021.htm#verse1">Sirach&nbsp;21:1</a></span> Sins remain, therefore, if they are not forgiven. But how do they remain if they are passed away? Only thus, they have passed away in their <em>act</em>, but they are permanent in their <em>guilt</em>. Contrariwise,  then, may it happen that a thing may remain in act, but pass away in guilt.</p>

<h2>Chapter 30 [XXVII.]&mdash; The Evil Desires of Concupiscence; We Ought to Wish that They May Not Be.</h2>

<p>For the concupiscence of the flesh is in some sort active, even when it does not exhibit either an assent of the heart, where its seat of empire is, or those members whereby, as its weapons, it fulfils what it is bent on. But what in this action does it effect, unless it be its <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> and shameful desires? For if these were good and lawful, the apostle would not forbid <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to them, saying, <q>Let not <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152158"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;6:12</a></span> He does not say, that you should have the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof, but <q>that you should <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> thereof;</q> in order that (as these desires are greater or less in different individuals, according as each shall have progressed in the renewal of the inner man) we may maintain the fight of <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> and <a href="../cathen/03637d.htm">chastity</a>, for the purpose of withholding <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to these <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>. Nevertheless, our wish ought to be nothing less than the nonexistence of these very desires, even if the accomplishment of such a wish be not possible in the body of this death. This is the reason why the same apostle, in another passage, addressing us as if in his own person, gives us this instruction: <q>For what I would,</q> says he, <q>that do I not; but what I <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hate</a>, that do I.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152159"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse15">Romans&nbsp;7:15</a></span> In a word, <q>I <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>.</q>  For he was unwilling to do this, that he might be perfect on every side. <q>If, then, I do that which I would not,</q> he goes on to say, <q>I consent unto the law that it is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152161"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse16">Romans&nbsp;7:16</a></span> Because the law, too, wills not that which I also would not. For it wills not that I should have concupiscence, for it says, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>;</q>  and I am no less unwilling to cherish so <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> a desire. In this, therefore, there is complete accord between the <a href="../cathen/15624a.htm">will</a> of the law and my own will. But because he was unwilling to <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>,  and yet did <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>,  and for all that did not by any means <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a> this concupiscence so as to yield assent to it, he immediately adds these words: <q>Now, then, it is no more I that do it, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that dwells in me.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152165"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;7:17</a></span> </p>

<h2>Chapter 31 [XXVIII.]&mdash; Who is the Man that Can Say, <q>It is No More I that Do It</q>?</h2>

<p>A man, however, is much deceived if, while consenting to the <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> of his flesh, and then both resolving in his mind to do its desires and setting about it, he supposes that he has still a right to say, <q>It is not I that do it,</q> even if he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> and loathes himself for assenting to <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires. The two things are simultaneous in his case: he <a href="../cathen/07149b.htm">hates</a> the thing himself because he <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knows</a> that it is <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>; and yet he does it, because he is bent on doing it. Now if, in addition to all this, he proceeds to do what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> forbids him, when it says, <q>Neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152166"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse13">Romans&nbsp;6:13</a></span> and completes with a bodily act what he was bent on doing in his mind; and says, <q>It is not I that do the thing, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that dwells in me,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152167"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;7:17</a></span> because he feels displeased with himself for resolving on and accomplishing the deed,&mdash; he so greatly <a href="../cathen/05525a.htm">errs</a> as not to <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> his own self. For, whereas he is altogether himself, his mind determining and his body executing his own purpose, he yet supposes that he is himself no longer! [XXIX.] That man, therefore, alone speaks the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> when he says, <q>It is no more I that do it, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that dwells in me,</q> who only feels the concupiscence, and neither resolves on doing it with the consent of his heart, nor accomplishes it with the ministry of his body.</p>

<h2>Chapter 32.&mdash; When Good Will Be Perfectly Done.</h2>

<p>The apostle then adds these words: <q>For I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perfect that which is <a href="../cathen/06636b.htm">good</a> I find not.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152168"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span> Now this is said, because a good thing is not then perfected, when there is an absence of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires, as <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is perfected when <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desires are <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>. But when they are present, but are not <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obeyed</a>, neither <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is performed, since <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> is not yielded to them; nor good, because of their inoperative presence. There is rather an intermediate condition of things: good is effected in some degree, because the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> concupiscence has gained no assent to itself; and in some degree there is a remnant of <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a>, because the concupiscence is present. This accounts for the apostle's precise words. He does not say, To <em>do</em> good is not present to him, but <q>how to perfect it.</q> For the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> is, one <em>does</em> a good deal of good when he does what the <a href="../bible/index.html">Scripture</a> enjoins, <q>Go not after your <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152169"><a href="../bible/sir018.htm#verse30">Sirach&nbsp;18:30</a></span> yet he falls short of perfection, in that he fails to keep the great commandment, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152170"><a href="../bible/exo020.htm#verse7">Exodus&nbsp;20:7</a></span> The law said, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a>,</q> in order that, when we find ourselves lying in this diseased state, we might seek the medicine of Grace, and by that commandment <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> both in what direction our endeavours should aim as we advance in our present mortal condition, and to what a height it is possible to reach in the future <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>. For unless perfection could somewhere be attained, this commandment would never have been given to us.</p>

<h2>Chapter 33 [XXX.]&mdash; True Freedom Comes with Willing Delight in God's Law.</h2>

<p>The apostle then repeats his former statement, the more fully to recommend its purport: <q>For the good,</q> says he, <q>that I would, I do not: but the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> which I would not, that I do. Now, if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> that dwells in me.</q> Then follows this: <q>I find then the law, when I would act, to be good to me; for <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is present with me.</q>  In other words, I find that the law is a good to me, when I wish to do what the law would have me do; inasmuch as it is not with the law itself (which says, <q>You shall not <a href="../cathen/04462a.htm">covet</a></q>) that <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is present; no, it is with myself that the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> is present, which I would not do, because I have the concupiscence even in my willingness. <q>For,</q> he adds, <q>I delight in the law of God after the inward man; but I see another law in my members warring against the law of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and bringing me into captivity to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which is in my members.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152172"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse22">Romans&nbsp;7:22-23</a></span> This delight with the law of God  after the inward man, comes to us from the mighty <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>; for thereby is our inward man renewed day by day, <span class="stiki" id="note152174"><a href="../bible/2co004.htm#verse16">2&nbsp;Corinthians&nbsp;4:16</a></span> because it is thereby that progress is made by us with perseverance. In it there is not the <a href="../cathen/06021a.htm">fear</a> that has torment, but the <a href="../cathen/09397a.htm">love</a> that cheers and gratifies. We are <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truly</a> free there, where we have no unwilling <a href="../cathen/07131b.htm">joy</a>.</p>

<h2>Chapter 34.&mdash; How Concupiscence Made a Captive of the Apostle; What the Law of Sin Was to the Apostle.</h2>

<p>Then, indeed, this statement, <q>I see another law in my members warring against the law of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>,</q> refers to that very concupiscence which we are now speaking of&mdash; the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in our sinful flesh. But when he said, <q>And bringing me into captivity to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> that is, to its own self, <q>which is in my members,</q> he either meant <q>bringing me into captivity,</q> in the sense of <em>endeavouring to make</em> me captive, that is, urging me to approve and accomplish <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> desire; or rather (and this opens no controversy), in the sense of leading me captive according to the flesh, and, if this is not possessed by the carnal concupiscence which he calls the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, no unlawful desire&mdash; such as our mind ought not to <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obey</a>&mdash; would,of course, be there to excite and disturb. The fact, however, that the apostle does not say, Bringing <em>my flesh</em> into captivity, but <q>Bringing <em>me</em> into captivity,</q> leads us to look out for some other meaning for the phrase, and to understand the term <q>bringing me into captivity</q> as if he had said, endeavouring to make me captive. But why, after all, might he not say, <q>Bringing me into captivity,</q> and at the same time mean us to understand his flesh? Was it not spoken by one concerning Jesus, when His flesh was not found in the sepulchre: <q>They have taken away my Lord, and I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> not where they have laid Him</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152175"><a href="../bible/joh020.htm#verse2">John&nbsp;20:2</a></span> Was Mary's then an improper question, because she said, <q>My Lord,</q> and not <q>My Lord's body</q> or <q>flesh</q>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 35 [XXXI.]&mdash; The Flesh, Carnal Affection.</h2>

<p>But we have in the apostle's own language, a little before, a sufficiently clear <a href="../cathen/12454c.htm">proof</a> that he might have meant his flesh when he said, <q>Bringing <em>me</em> into captivity.</q> For after declaring, <q>I <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">know</a> that <em>in me</em> dwells no good thing,</q> he at once added an explanatory sentence to this effect, <q>That is, <em>in my flesh</em>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152176"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse18">Romans&nbsp;7:18</a></span> It is then the flesh, in which there dwells nothing good, that is brought into captivity to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now he designates that as the flesh wherein lies a certain morbid carnal affection, not the mere conformation of our bodily fabric whose members are not to be used as weapons for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>&mdash; that is, for that very concupiscence which holds this flesh of ours captive. So far, indeed, as concerns this actual bodily substance and nature of ours, it is already God's temple in all faithful men, whether living in marriage or in continence. If, however, absolutely nothing of our flesh were in captivity, not even to the <a href="../cathen/04764a.htm">devil</a>, because there has accrued to it the remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> be not imputed to it (and this is properly designated the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>); yet if under this law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, that is, under its own concupiscence, our flesh were not to some degree held captive, how could that be <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> which the apostle states, when he speaks of our <q>waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body</q>? <span class="stiki" id="note152177"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse23">Romans&nbsp;8:23</a></span> In so far, then, as there is now this waiting for the redemption of our body, there is also in some degree still existing something in us which is a captive to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Accordingly he exclaims, <q>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, through <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Jesus Christ</a> our Lord.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152178"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse24">Romans&nbsp;7:24</a></span> What are we to understand by such language, but that our body, which is undergoing corruption, weighs heavily on our <a href="../cathen/14153a.htm">soul</a>? When, therefore, this very body of ours shall be restored to us in an incorrupt state, there shall be a full liberation from the body of this death; but there will be no such deliverance for them who shall rise again to condemnation. To the body of this death then is understood to be owing the circumstance that there is in our members another law which <a href="../cathen/15546c.htm">wars</a> against the law of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, so long as the flesh <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lusts</a> against the spirit&mdash; without, however, subjugating the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, inasmuch as on its side, too, the spirit has a concupiscence contrary to the flesh. <span class="stiki" id="note152179"><a href="../bible/gal005.htm#verse17">Galatians&nbsp;5:17</a></span> Thus, although the actual law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> partly holds the flesh in captivity (whence comes its resistance to the law of the mind), still it has not an absolute empire in our body, notwithstanding its mortal state, since it refuses <a href="../cathen/11181c.htm">obedience</a> to its desires. <span class="stiki" id="note152180"><a href="../bible/rom006.htm#verse12">Romans&nbsp;6:12</a></span> For in the case of hostile armies between whom there is an earnest conflict, even the side which is inferior in the fight usually holds a something which it has captured; and although in some such way there is somewhat in our flesh which is kept under the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, yet it has before it the hope of redemption: and then there will remain not a particle of this corrupt concupiscence; but our flesh, healed of that diseased plague, and wholly clad in <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, shall live for evermore in <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> blessedness.</p>

<h2>Chapter 36.&mdash; Even Now While We Still Have Concupiscence We May Be Safe in Christ.</h2>

<p>But the apostle pursues the subject, and says, <q>So then with the mind I myself serve the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>, but with the flesh the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>;</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152181"><a href="../bible/rom007.htm#verse25">Romans&nbsp;7:25</a></span> which must be thus understood: <q>With my mind I serve the law of <a href="../cathen/06608a.htm">God</a>,</q> by refusing my consent to the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; <q>with my flesh, however,</q> I serve <q>the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>,</q> by having the desires of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, from which I am not yet entirely freed, although I yield them no assent. Then let us observe carefully what he has said after all the above: <q>There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152182"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse1">Romans&nbsp;8:1</a></span> Even <em> now</em>, says he, when the law in my members keeps up its warfare against the law of my <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, and retains in captivity somewhat in the body of this death, there is no condemnation to them which are in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>. And listen why: <q>For the law of the spirit of life in <a href="../cathen/08374c.htm">Christ Jesus</a>,</q> says he, <q>has made me free from the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> and death.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152183"><a href="../bible/rom008.htm#verse2">Romans&nbsp;8:2</a></span> How made me free, except by abolishing its sentence of guilt by the remission of all my <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>; so that, though it still remains, only daily lessening more and more, it is nevertheless not imputed to me as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>?</p>

<h2>Chapter 37 [XXXII.]&mdash; The Law of Sin with Its Guilt in Unbaptized Infants. By Adam's Sin the Human Race Has Become a <q>Wild Olive Tree.</q></h2>

<p>Until, then, this remission of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> takes place in the offspring, they have within them the law of <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> in such manner, that it is really imputed to them as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>; in other words, with that law there is attaching to them its sentence of guilt, which holds them debtors to <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> condemnation. For what a parent transmits to his carnal offspring is the condition of his own carnal birth, not that of his spiritual new birth. For, that he was born in the flesh, although no hindrance after the remission of his guilt to his fruit, still remains hidden, as it were, in the seed of the olive, even though, because of the remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, it in no respect injures the oil&mdash; that is, in plain language, his life which he lives, <q>righteous by <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a>,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152184"><a href="../bible/rom001.htm#verse17">Romans&nbsp;1:17</a></span> after Christ, whose very name comes from the oil, that is, from the anointing.  That, however, which in the case of a regenerate parent, as in the seed of the pure olive, is covered without any guilt, which has been remitted, is still no <a href="../cathen/05141a.htm">doubt</a> retained in the case of his offspring, which is yet unregenerate, as in the wild olive, with all its guilt, until here also it be remitted by the self-same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>. When Adam <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sinned</a>, he was changed from that pure olive, which had no such corrupt seed whence should spring the bitter issue of the wild olive, into a wild olive tree; and, inasmuch as his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> was so great, that by it his nature became commensurately changed for the worse, he converted the entire race of man into a wild olive stock. The effect of this change we see illustrated, as has been said above, in the instance of these very trees. Whenever God's <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a> converts a sapling into a good olive, so that the fault of the first birth (that original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> which had been derived and contracted from the concupiscence of the flesh) is remitted, covered, and not imputed, there is still inherent in it that nature from which is born a wild olive, unless it, too, by the same <a href="../cathen/06689a.htm">grace</a>, is by the second birth changed into a good olive.</p>

<h2>Chapter 38 [XXXIII.]&mdash; To Baptism Must Be Referred All Remission of Sins, and the Complete Healing of the Resurrection. Daily Cleansing.</h2>

<p>Blessed, therefore, is the olive tree <q>whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> are covered;</q> blessed is it <q>to which the Lord has not imputed <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>.</q>  But this, which has received the remission, the covering, and the acquittal, even up to the complete change into an <a href="../cathen/05551b.htm">eternal</a> <a href="../cathen/07687a.htm">immortality</a>, still retains a secret force which furnishes seed for a wild and bitter olive tree, unless the same tillage of God prunes it also, by remission, covering, and acquittal. There will, however, be left no corruption at all in even carnal seed, when the same regeneration, which is now effected through the sacred laver, purges and heals all man's <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evil</a> to the very end. By its means the very same flesh, through which the carnal mind was formed, shall become spiritual,&mdash; no longer having that carnal <a href="../cathen/09438a.htm">lust</a> which resists the law of the <a href="../cathen/10321a.htm">mind</a>, no longer emitting carnal seed. For in this sense must be understood that which the apostle whom we have so often quoted says elsewhere: <q>Christ loved the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, and gave Himself for it; that He might sanctify and cleanse it by the washing of water by the word; that He might present it to Himself a <a href="../cathen/06585a.htm">glorious</a> Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152187"><a href="../bible/eph005.htm#verse25">Ephesians&nbsp;5:25</a></span> It must, I say, be understood as implying, that by this laver of regeneration and word of sanctification all the <a href="../cathen/05649a.htm">evils</a> of regenerate men of whatever kind are cleansed and healed&mdash;not the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> only which are all now remitted in <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, but those also which after <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> are committed by <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">human</a> <a href="../cathen/07648a.htm">ignorance</a> and frailty; not, indeed, that <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> is to be repeated as often as <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is repeated, but that by its one only ministration it comes to pass that pardon is secured to the faithful of all their <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> both before and after their regeneration. For of what use would repentance be, either before <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a>, if <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptism</a> did not follow; or after it, if it did not precede? Nay, in the Lord's Prayer itself, which is our daily cleansing, of what avail or advantage would it be for that petition to be uttered, <q>Forgive us our debts,</q> <span class="stiki" id="note152188"><a href="../bible/mat006.htm#verse12">Matthew&nbsp;6:12</a></span> unless it be by such as have been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? And in like manner, how great soever be the liberality and kindness of a man's <a href="../cathen/01328f.htm">alms</a>, what, I ask, would they profit him towards the remission of his <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> if he had not been <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a>? In short, on whom but on the <a href="../cathen/02258b.htm">baptized</a> shall be bestowed the very felicities of the <a href="../cathen/08646a.htm">kingdom of heaven</a>; where the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> shall have no spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; where there shall be nothing blameworthy, nothing unreal; where there shall be not only no guilt for <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>, but no concupiscence to excite it?</p>

<h2>Chapter 39 [XXXIV.]&mdash; By the Holiness of Baptism, Not Sins Only, But All Evils Whatsoever, Have to Be Removed. The Church is Not Yet Free from All Stain.</h2>

<p>And thus not only all the <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>, but all the ills of men of what kind soever, are in course of removal by the <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holiness</a> of that <a href="../cathen/03712a.htm">Christian</a> laver whereby Christ cleanses His Church, that He may present it to Himself, not in this world, but in that which is to come, as not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing. Now there are some who maintain that such is the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> even now, and yet they are in it. Well then, since they confess that they have some <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a> themselves, if they say the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">truth</a> in this (and, of course, they do, as they are not free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sins</a>), then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has <q>a spot</q> in them; while if they tell an untruth in their confession (as speaking from a double heart), then the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a> has in them <q>a wrinkle.</q> If, however, they assert that it is themselves, and not the <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">Church</a>, which has all this, they then as good as acknowledge that they are not its members, nor belong to its body, so that they are even condemned by their own confession.</p>

<h2>Chapter 40 [XXXV.]&mdash; Refutation of the Pelagians by the Authority of St. Ambrose, Whom They Quote to Show that the Desire of the Flesh is a Natural Good.</h2>

<p>In respect, however, to this concupiscence of the flesh, we have striven in this lengthy discussion to distinguish it accurately from the goods of marriage. This we have done on account of our modern <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, who cavil whenever concupiscence is censured, as if it involved a censure of marriage. Their object is to praise concupiscence as a natural good, that so they may defend their own baneful dogma, which asserts that those who are born by its means do not contract original <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. Now the blessed Ambrose, <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a> of Milan, by whose <a href="../cathen/12406a.htm">priestly</a> office I received the washing of regeneration, briefly spoke on this matter, when, expounding the <a href="../cathen/12477a.htm">prophet</a> Isaiah, he gathered from him the nativity of Christ in the flesh: <q>Thus,</q> says the <a href="../cathen/02581b.htm">bishop</a>, <q>He was both tempted in all points as a <a href="../cathen/09580c.htm">man</a>, <span class="stiki" id="note152189"><a href="../bible/heb004.htm#verse15">Hebrews&nbsp;4:15</a></span> and in the likeness of man He bare all things; but inasmuch as He was born of the <a href="../cathen/07409a.htm">Spirit</a>, He kept Himself from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. For every man is a liar; and there is none without <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> but God alone. It has, therefore, been ever firmly maintained, that it is clear that no man from husband and wife, that is to say, by means of that conjunction of their <a href="../cathen/11726a.htm">persons</a>, is free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a>. He who is free from <a href="../cathen/14004b.htm">sin</a> is also free from conception of this kind.</q> Well now, what is it which St. Ambrose has here condemned in the <a href="../cathen/15073a.htm">true</a> doctrine of this deliverance?&mdash; is it the goodness of marriage, or not rather the worthless opinion of these <a href="../cathen/07256b.htm">heretics</a>, although they had not then come upon the stage? I have thought it worth while to adduce this testimony, because Pelagius mentions Ambrose with such commendation as to say: <q>The blessed Bishop Ambrose, in whose writings more than anywhere else the Roman <a href="../cathen/05752c.htm">faith</a> is clearly stated, has flourished like a beautiful flower among the Latin writers. His fidelity and extremely pure perception of the sense of Scripture no opponent even has ever ventured to impugn.</q>  I hope he may regret having entertained opinions opposed to Ambrose, but not that he has bestowed this praise on that <a href="../cathen/07386a.htm">holy</a> man.</p>

<p>Here, then, you have my book, which, owing to its tedious length and difficult subject, it has been as troublesome for me to compose as for you to read, in those little snatches of time in which you have been able (or at least, as I suppose, have been able) to find yourself at leisure. Although it has been indeed drawn up with considerable labour amidst my <a href="../cathen/03744a.htm">ecclesiastical</a> duties, as God has vouchsafed to give me His help, I should hardly have intruded it on your notice, with all your public cares, if I had not been informed by a godly man, who has an intimate <a href="../cathen/08673a.htm">knowledge</a> of you, that you take such pleasure in reading as to lie awake by the hour, night after night, spending the precious time in your favourite pursuit.</p>
